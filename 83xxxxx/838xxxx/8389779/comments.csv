,athhcarl,2013-04-20T00:07Z,Thanks a lot! 
,Hadley88,2013-04-22T21:52Z,Whats up with GSTL FXO vs Axiom? :o
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-23T16:53Z,It's usually released couple days later when the following GSL Code S group is played.
,tpbfreund,2013-04-23T22:20Z,"I'm eternally grateful for these uploads, although I can't help but wonder why is the audio soooo bad in all the VODs?"
,ash8888,2013-04-23T23:04Z,"Yeah - Superbibi - thanks from me too.

Any chance you are going to be able to upload the EU and NA WCS playoffs?  If not - know a good source?"
,SugarGuY,2013-04-24T13:52Z,"Hey man, any chance for group G please?"
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-24T16:19Z,"Just uploaded Group G, GSTL day[9] and day 10."
,SugarGuY,2013-04-24T16:26Z,"Thanks again man, looking forward for upcoming uploads."
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-24T16:45Z,"All WCS streams and VOD are on Twitch TV. Search with terms 'twitch' and 'wcs' on google.
WCS Europe is free AFAIK, don't know about WCS America but it appears to be free too."
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-24T16:53Z,"Audio is fine on my computer. It's not stellar quality but totally audible. Anyway, I don't encode the files, i just upload them here so I can't really do anything about it."
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-25T03:27Z,"Apparently, MLG is posting some games from WCS America on their Youtube channel also."
,SC2Superbibi,2013-04-25T18:46Z,"GSTL Day 10 has been deleted at my request, files were the same as Day[9]. "
,SC2Superbibi,2013-05-02T22:44Z,Fixed GSTL Day 10 has been uploaded.
