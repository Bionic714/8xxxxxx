,Snowman2323,2013-04-19T20:19Z,Free from April 28th. This beta will be useless after tomorrow
,Douudah,2013-04-19T20:42Z,"Careful, Virus on DeadZ !"
,Snowman2323,2013-04-19T21:59Z,Not a virus. The .exe is encrypted so some AVs will see this as a virus but they're just trying to stop hackers and reverse-engineers
,Br_FoX,2013-04-19T23:35Z,is a false-positive
