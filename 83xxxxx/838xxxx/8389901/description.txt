Three self-involved Edinburgh roommates-played by (Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston  and Ewan McGregor), in his first starring role-take in a brooding boarder. When he dies of an overdose, leaving a suitcase full of money, the trio embark on a series of very bad decisions, with extraordinarily grim consequences for all. Macabre but with a streak of offbeat humor, this stylistically influential tale of guilt and derangement is a full-throttle bit of Hitchcockian nastiness.
