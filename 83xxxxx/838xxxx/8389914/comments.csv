@dhjudasx:

How to tell that which soundtrack has 5.1 audio while playing on big tv. In PC VLC i can see and i can switch to 5.1 and 2.0. "
,buenio,2013-04-20T03:53Z,Judas if you have Expendables 1 and 2 please upload it thanks.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-20T04:06Z,"Depends on the TV.. but it should be listed as the 2nd option....

Playback through most tvs should produce significantly better sound.. however Transmission of 5.1 audio may not work (doesn't matter if it's ac3/dts... most tvs do not passthrough to 5.1)

I'm working on expendables.. the copy i have is only the theatrical version.. i intend on getting the expendables twin pack extended unrated editions."
,buenio,2013-04-20T09:09Z,Ok Mr. Judas take your time and don't upload the theatrical version because we all prefer the Unrated version thanks Judas.
,buenio,2013-04-20T13:07Z,Judas just a question will a 192 kbps 5.1 surround sound are almost good as to the DTS True HD 1510 kbps sound?

@dhjudasx:

Can u name it the transmission as AAC 2.0 Stereo and AAC 5.1 Surround so i can know and switch it easily on TV. When i choose option 1 it displays as language 1 and option 2 it displays as language 2 on my tv. The subtitle option is good so I can turn ON or OFF on my tv. What TV does u have at your home? The only request is can u name the 2 audio soundtrack transmissions."
,buenio,2013-04-20T15:57Z,"@rajakumar for me i played all 5.1 movies on my Sony KLV 40ex430 40"" LED thru USB and I switch it to 5.1 channel with no problem. It depends on the built in sound system of the tv."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-20T17:29Z,"buenio 192kbps AAC5.1 2 pass encoding i do is equal to that of about 448-640kbps DTS/AC3/DD 5.1

Although my source is MASTER Audio usually (or the highest available on the bluray), to obtain that level of quality would require a fairly significant boost in bitrate and a change over to at least 24bit encoding of the aac format.. something that'll break playback support.

It is similar to that of wishing i could switch to 10bit encoding for x264, i could do this, improve the quality of the video noticeably, however at the expense of forcing people to only be able to play it on their computers (good bye everything else)

Either way, my current audio encoding is arguably fantastic by even an audiophiles ear. You'd be hard pressed to notice or know the difference under a blind test.


Rajakumar, this is a limitation of your tv for selecting which audio. I cannot technically ""Name"" the audio tracks for any specific tv to recognize it as being listed as 5.1 or not.

Most of all the tvs just show it as Language option 1 and 2... the 2nd should always be the 5.1 track."

@buenio:
Okay then no problem. You have a wonderful tv. I too play all judas movies thru an USB. I understand there is no name for 5.1 it says only language 1, and language 2. Do u know which is 5.1 channel audio stream. On my tv it can handle, play both streams, i can choose any audio to play but i don't know which is 5.1 audio.

@dhjudasx:
I will choose option 2 for to get 5.1 track on my tv. There is any difference in hearing can we tell by listen their kb/s. 

thanks"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-21T02:06Z,"if the tv can decode 5.1 AAC properly.. you should notice pretty good improvement in overall quality/clarity and depth of audio.... should sound much richer.. (as the AAC5.1 codec backward capability downmixing should ""technically"" do a better job of producing proper stereo when mixing the 5.1 channels into just 2... pulling only necessary audio data from all channels when needed)"
,rajakumar,2013-04-21T17:13Z,"
@dhjudasx:

I thought opposite way, low quality sound is for 5.1 and other rich high sound is for 2.0. Now I understood so my tv plays both audios. I will switch to option language 2 for 5.1 while playing on TV. Thanks for the info."
,buenio,2013-04-22T07:19Z,Yes Audio 2 is the 5.1.
