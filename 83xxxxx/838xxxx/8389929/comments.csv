,ivanhoe68,2013-04-20T11:40Z,"This is not working, dll file error. And it opens up chrome during the install and sends you to a website. TROJAN inside. The_Duck1 you should loose your skull for this. I have atleast 90 downloaded games on my computer, but this game raised all the warning signals of viruses inside. Delete Torrent Please......."

Normally i never replay but you are a big fat layer.
I can't help that your system files (dll) not configured probably and you will blame me for that?

Where do you get the info for a Trojan? your thumb? Try a better virus scanner. there is not one good virus scanner who will find anything in one of my torrents. What Ubisoft doing with your pc it's not my problem.

There are 100's downloads of this torrent and you are the only one who is complaining about trojans. if more people are having problems they will let me know.
And yes, i want to know if something is not working then i can think of a solution for his/her problem, but don't act like a clown who knows everything better.

With kind regards,
The_Duck1"

I Was wondering if you were able to save with this version ? The previous copy I got did not let me save nor autosaved properly."
[T],The_Duck1,2013-04-21T13:29Z,sorry i din't test it that far.
,MAA11792,2013-04-21T17:08Z,don't work and the game sucks
,ivanhoe68,2013-04-21T17:31Z,"@The_Duck1

Malwarebytes, AVG and Windows defender all react to this torrent. So dont call me a big fat lier, but you can call AVG Malwarebytes and Defender LIARS, since it`s the telling me. Normally AVG would react, and i would put the warnig at exception. But since i got THREE warnings, and it opens up Chrome without my permission, it is a TROJAN!!! 

Steamapi is the DLL file it complains about. And i have that DLL. 

PEACE

,MLO89,2013-04-24T21:35Z,"As with all the rest, this one doesn't save either. Hope this gets fixed. Pain in the ass to have to start from beginning each time."
,xylo33,2013-04-24T21:47Z,fucking trojans ! take away this guys skull . He doesn't deserve it !
,mcfatzz,2013-04-26T18:05Z,it worked for me. the dll file error is an error with your directx. reupload it.
,andrefpc,2013-04-27T22:19Z,"after install, when I open the game it opens Uplay, asking for CD key...Am I doing something wrong?"
