Shook Twins are not your average folk duo. They have some tricks up their sleeves. You wouldnΓÇÖt expect a small town girl from North Idaho to drop a beatbox in the middle of a song. One plays the guitar, glockenspiel, mandolin, sings into a telephone and bocks like a chicken. The other plays wah-wah Banjo and loops various melodies and beats to make it sound like more than just two identical twin sisters. Together they sing in twin harmony, which is a whole different experience than non-twin harmony. Their sound was sculpted from the artists who inspire them most such as: The Beatles, Ani Difranco, Joni Mitchell, Feist and Bjork. Shook Twins have performed with bands such as: Ryan Adams, Mason Jennings, Johnatha Brook, Michelle Shocked, JJ Gray and MoFro, Crooked Still, Scott Law, Darol Anger, Jason Webley, The BoDeans, Equaleyes, Elephant Revival, Taarka, Kaylee Cole, Karli Fairbanks, Joel Smith, John Craigie, Josh Hedlund, The Head and the Heart and many more amazing regional artists and bands. They bring an exciting, lighthearted energy to the stage that seems to be quite refreshing.
