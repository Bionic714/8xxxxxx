,BTMas2k,2013-05-07T16:27Z,"Thanks for these... quick question though man.  For the life of me these vids won't convert using mkv2vob, or any converter for that matter. It converts but during muxing something must be getting messed up, since the video is on high speed, with audio at normal speed.  Doesn't matter how I try to convert it, always ends up that way.  Any light you can shed on this?  Would ideally like to not have to sit at my PC to watch em all, but will if I have to."
