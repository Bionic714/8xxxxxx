                  Take the role of a mighty Master and shape the destiny
                  of Eador, on land and within the astral plane itself.
                  Explore the land and rule provinces as you see fit,
                  defend them, and keep the populace in line or they may
                  rebel. Choose from thousands of items--swords, spells,
                  weapons, armor, and more--to outfit the heroes you
                  recruit so they may best meet any challenge. Keep your
                  heroes healthy and they will grow stronger as they gain
                  experience from battle. Forge alliances and engage in
                  the delicate art of diplomacy as you negotiate trade
                  agreements or wage war against a mutual foe. Eador, with
                  its many wonders and adventures, awaits. Will you answer
                  the call?
