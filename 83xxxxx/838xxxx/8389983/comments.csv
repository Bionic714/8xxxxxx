Please don't put those full stops in your torrent title because it means the PB search won't find it unless we know the full exact name, ie we need to search for Formula1.2013.Bahrain.Grand.Prix.Practice.Two.720p.HDTV.x264-FAI - searching for 'formula 1' or 'f1' won't find your torrent.

Cheers"
,gyrex,2013-04-21T02:50Z,@mordokch PB does pick up the title with full stops/periods. You won't find it under formula 1 or f1 because those strings aren't in the title. I usually search for the name of the grand prix and the year or prix. ie. bahrain 2013 or bahrain prix. Try that...
