,martypawn,2013-04-21T14:52Z,"I don't know where do you take your FLAC files
BUT
I think you don't understand what is a real FLAC.
I just download it and the same of Garfunkel,

NOTHING in FLAC, only bad MP3 around 192 Kbps.
Verify with 2 programs(Adobe Audition and Sonic
Visualizer )

This is the last time I take something from YOU
each time is TRANSCODING FILES

BAD FLAC MUSIC UPLOADER
but GOOD BAD MP3 Uploader"
