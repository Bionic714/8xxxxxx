,gmartcab,2013-05-19T16:57Z,"It won't work for me on 10.7.5, the game starts fine but when actually entering a scenario the game terrain is plain white - I can still see the interface, but that's all. Furthermore, I have to wait for about two minutes since I press the menu button for the menu to actually pop up."
