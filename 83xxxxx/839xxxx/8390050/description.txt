Heinrich XIII And The Devilgrass Pickers - Devilgrass Country (2009) mp3


Heinrich XIII And The Devilgrass Pickers is a group of good ol’ country boys from Wölfersheim, Germany. Heinrich XIII and the Devilgrass Pickers play a version of old school country music, which reflects their roots in metal and alternative music. It used to be a fairly well travelled path from punk, metal and grunge to alt. country, and it’s nearly always been a sincere transition. There maybe a little humour in their new songs, but that only mirrors classic country music in general, and there’s no doubt Heinrich and his band are serious musicians playing music they love.

Heinrich XIII And The Devilgrass Pickers ain't like the country music you know. Except if you are one of those, that still know the good old or even new stuff far away from today's big radio and TV stations. They are one of the few german country bands who write their own songs and play some kind of classic or vintage country music paired with bluegrass elements. So if you're looking for acoustic guitar, upright bass, banjo, mandolin, dobro, electric guitar, steel guitar, fiddle and drums in spirited combinations, that's exactly what you'll get.
