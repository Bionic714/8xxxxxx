,Storr1,2013-04-19T22:24Z,"it is me or this doesn`t have single mode at all ?

,snowstone,2013-04-19T22:31Z,can you play co-op with this? or is it just solo play
,xkooltoken,2013-04-19T23:01Z,@snowstone If I remember correctly it does have co-op so have fun!
,Pual634,2013-04-19T23:30Z,@Storr1 Lol.
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-20T03:49Z,"I really like this game, just wish you could play with other people. the game gets pretty hard solo. but good game otherwise."

,BullZzai,2013-04-20T07:14Z,"works great. Btw, how can i put 640x480 resolution?"
,LiquidAnxiety,2013-04-20T07:50Z,Has anyone got this to work?! when installed and cracked i get an error to close application.and why are there 3 different reloaded torrent of this game with different number of seeders but the others have no comments?i'm begining to think these reloaded torrents are all a joke.is there a better steam.apid available? AND P.S Same with SANG FROID.if anyone got these to work please comment and relay how you managed it.  Thanks
,GObonzo,2013-04-20T12:28Z,"damn, some dumbass people as usual"
,xylo33,2013-04-20T17:10Z,Why did you put in a trojan ?  I thought we could trust VIPs . guess not
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-20T18:33Z,"@xylo33

lol every torrent I see some dumbass comment like yours saying ""Trojan alert"" or ""virus here"". if you knew anything about computers you would know its a false-positive. the crappy anti-virus software thinks the steam.dll is a virus, but obviously its not. I've never had a problem with stiffy torrents.

@LiquidAnxiety

This game runs perfect. I've had it installed fine. just follow the instructions and it should work perfect. you don't even have to unrar, it comes in an ISO file. burn and mount, install, go to the drive where you installed it, F. or D/ or C drive. than open and copy the contents from the crack file to the BIN folder or the programs files x86. I didn't have to block anything in my firewall. And as for SANG-FROID, that worked flawlessly too. its the same steps as this torrent I believe. so don't say these torrents are a ""joke"" because there are legit. i'm playing the games you cant get to work as we speak. P.s Sang-froid isn't a really good game. I would just avoid it. IMO"
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-20T21:35Z,"@ P.I.N.G

how? mine didn't find any problems. and I completely scanned my system and have no spyware and no viruses. but maybe I'm just a lucky one."
,MrGormogon,2013-04-21T02:49Z,"the torrent is good, downloaded it and installed with no problems but this game is garbage!

unless u play it with other ppl its very hard to beat and it will take for ever to unlock the cool stuff! "
,usuals,2013-04-21T04:12Z,theres no virus here .... i think BluntzNzigzags put it best when he posted about this torrent. 
,PseudoPositive,2013-04-21T04:37Z,"Thanks stiffy, game works well, no viruses, Xbox360 controller compatibility as well, but game is hectic!!, it'll take a while to finish, but it's not a bad game, just a hard one."
,LiquidAnxiety,2013-04-21T06:28Z,"Hey BluntzNzigzagz, do you think possable the download could be corrupted somehow due to connection issues therefore i may be missing file and need to redownload?"
,LiquidAnxiety,2013-04-21T06:31Z,Or do you think i might get an error or corrupted file during installation if my pc is too buisy durring instalation?
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-21T06:58Z,"@LiquidAnxiety

if you did the whole install process correct, and it still doesn't work, than yes. I think a file or 2 might have gotten corrupted and you should try uninstall and install again. If that doesn't work, than try to Troubleshoot compatibility. Like if you have Windows 8, put it to xp or something . If that doesn't work than I'm sorry. out of ideas."
,MAA11792,2013-04-21T17:07Z,Mr.Stifmeister = number one fag and douchebag.
,exel5555,2013-04-21T22:50Z,Does anyone know what music or song is playing during the installer? I like it but have no idea what it is. Thanks!
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-04-22T04:14Z,Digging the picture in the title. Pretty funny and sure to make more well known the fact you upload only good shit. Are you Extreme Zone in disguise???
,RAMEN00DLE5,2013-04-22T04:17Z,"Holy shit, there's WAY more morons here than usual. What's going on with this upload? The inbred's all have a crush on Stiffmeister maybe?"
,snowstone,2013-04-22T17:15Z,install just fine shame co-op no work :( its just solo play
,rotans88,2013-04-22T19:23Z,"nice game actually , iam kinda more fps player , but this game looks really fun, also performance looks very nice , i have 2*2.2 ghz, radeon 6670(2gb 128 bit.), 3gb ram , and i can max this game , with stable 45 fps , sure hoping on next patch or smth. they will remove 45 fps cap,with motion blur in feels acceptable smooth , but , yeah ,45fps is 45fps :D"
,alex123456789123456,2013-04-22T21:25Z,"awsome game, totally worth buing for only 7$"
,XelaRedna,2013-04-23T04:13Z,"Nice job Stifmeister, not sure if ill grab this one... 

I know everyone says they like your title pic for your uploads.. not that i care but in my honest opinion its nice to see the cover of the game..  It makes it seem more legit and it convinces me to download it sometimes if the game has a cool cover..

Maybe put a stamp in the corner saying ""approved by Stifmeister""..make it look like a real award or something... Just a thought. 

Thanks, keep it up"
,Terucksas,2013-04-23T23:44Z,"Torrent works flawlessly. Thanks, Stifmeister!

NOTE ABOUT COOP: You can play with other people using Tuungle. Just run Tuungle and log in. In God Mode, switch your party settings to LAN and you will see a list of everyone in the Tuungle room with you.  "
