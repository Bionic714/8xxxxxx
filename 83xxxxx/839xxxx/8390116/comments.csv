Thanks to the seeders!

If you like the work and you think the rip is OK - PLEASE SEED - others without pay for view  privileges should be able to see it too. They've made more than their production costs already. 

P'bay - the world's public library. Please SEED!"

Please SEED!

Don't believe the PRESS bulshite. Most NZ'ers and Ozies have great respect for Indian society, culture and civilisation. Let's support each other in this shitty corporate world and share good art.
