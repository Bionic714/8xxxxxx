Req Majestic Software Dash8 Q400"
,Karlskrone,2013-04-22T23:01Z,"Hallo SnakEye, thank you for the Update. But after installation of SP 1 for the new version of REX essential plus Overdrive for FSX, I detected really strong increasing handles of the REX process. What´s goeing on there? Is there somebody else who have the same experience. I can´t believe, that the SP1 for REX is released in such bad condition. Before installation of he Sp1 everything was fine. No handle of the REX Process were growing up."
,BunnyHairedKid,2013-04-23T01:22Z,thanks snakeye! do u think you cud crack the new majestic dash 8 Q400?
,udidwht,2013-04-23T04:25Z,"@ KarlSkrone

No issues on my end after SP1 install. Have you tried uninstalling/reinstalling REX and SP1?What are your system specs? As well as any other add-ons..."
,kingashi,2013-04-23T06:37Z,"@ KarlSkrone

Reinstalling may fix ur problem..like i did a clean install then installed this update....make sure u restore ur default textures....

and after this update the weather engine woks so good...."
,Karlskrone,2013-04-23T21:00Z,"@udidwht and @kingashi,

thank you for your kindly answer. Shure, that´s really not the right place to discuess problems but did you really check the consumption of handles of the process of REX.EXE during one our continues flying?"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-04-23T21:30Z,"@Karlskrone how many handles the REX process has on your machine?
and is it a constant number?
you can try and dig out to what process the handle counts increases to (to what process, network address, etc the handles are for) by Using SPA in your perfmon on your machine once you get a high count.

what is your handle counts you getting with REX.exe?"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-04-23T21:31Z,"@udidwht handles has nothing to do with Computer spects, this means the Process has opened handle sessions with other process and or network IPs, etc."
,Karlskrone,2013-04-23T23:31Z,"Hallo _SnakEye,
thank you verry much for your answer. Currently when I start REX without the UPdate1 I have related to the REX-Process nearby 1400 Handles. It´s also nearby 1400 Handles after flying for example one hour with PMDG 737 NGX. With the installed update 1 after 45 minutes airborne I have 3000 Handles for REX. I didn´t have a look to the Resourcen-Monitor where I should able to see which kind of Handles are related directly to REX and are increasing ... sorry. Now I installed a fall back (the same software constellation without update 1) and everything is o.k. One issue what I also noticed with Update 1 is, that REX injected every 1,5 minutes a weatherupdate to the FSX. My setting was every 15 minutes. Mysterious !!! My suspicion is that this high frequency of weatherinjection has something to do with the stron growing up of handles. Can you help me? Greetings from Germany"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-04-24T19:46Z,"OK, here is the thing higher process handle does not necessarily means a bad thing, all it means that the process access more resources.
it is very likely that SP1 introduced more background features that require high number of System resources, like accessing the memory, reading the registry, file access, Internet connection sessions, etc.
every access of any kind is done with a handle.
3000 handles is considered resalable number.
one of the rule of thumb that Microsoft Premier Engineers learn in the ""VitalSigns Performance Monitoring"" is that anything below 10,000 handles doesn't need to raise a red flag.
anything behind 10,000 handles should already light up a red light and should be investigated.
it could also be a handle leek due to poor program code.
however that is not our situation as we see that REX keeps it pretty steady at a fixed number.
if there was an handle leek , you would see it increasing with time until it starts effecting performance and/or the Program (REX) would crash.
I wouldn't worry about that number.
just to give you an example your AV client is most likely to have such number (behind 2000), that doesn't mean that it is faulty, just that it access more resources due to the program's nature of work (real time protection, registry access, file access - all those for protecting any movement in them)."

,Niceify,2013-04-29T14:56Z,snakeye i got my hands on the BBS A320 0.75 are you interested to crack it? Dun ask how i got it :P 
,Karlskrone,2013-05-01T22:45Z,"Hallo _SnakEye, thank you for your long statement. Fact is, that on my PC after installing this SP1 for REX I have a strong increasing handle of the REX process. Every 2 seconds one handle more. After 1 hour airborne I reach 10000 handles. 10 minutes later, the FSX crashed. Without SP1 absolut no problem. Amount of handles of Rex are constant. I gues, there must be a failure inside this nice ""improvement"" of REX. Ohterwise should I really be the only one who have problems with SP1 ????"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-05-03T22:50Z,"that could indicate there might be Handle leak in the new SP1 of REX.
I will try and see if I see the same on my REX.
I hardly use REX anymore as my Weather engine as I am using now OpusFSX as my weather engine, which IMO and extensive testing I ran all three (REX/Opus/AS2012), Opus was always the most accurate among those three. also the easiest to use. not to mention the Live view/Camera Opus has as well."
