,Xertio,2013-04-19T22:44Z,"@XxCmonxX. This is the mod for Arma 2. The standalone game is called The War Z, or WarZ. I dont know if this its real or a fake though."
,Fluid56,2013-04-19T22:52Z,the mod. standalone isn't even half way done.
,Fluid56,2013-04-19T22:54Z,"The War Z is not the standalone version of DayZ.

War Z is a shitty ripoff by a shitty game company called Hammerpoint. you might remember them from the shitty-ass game War Inc.

War Z has NOTHING to do with Day Z and is little more than a shitty wanna-be ripoff. If you spent any money on the War Z, you should be ashamed of yourself right now. "
