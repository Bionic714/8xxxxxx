The Limit Club - This is Cutthroat Business (2011) mp3

In July 2009, The Limit Club completed a full West coast tour where they debuted much of their new material that would later find its way into the album, This is Cutthroat Business. In 2010, Juan Carlos relinquished his position with The Quakes to focus on the Limit Club. Work on the upcoming album proceeded slowly, and Cutthroat Business wasn't fully recorded, mixed and released until March 2011. The extra time was not in waste, for this proved to be the most professional album yet. They filmed their first music video in June 2011 for the single, Shake from utthroat Business (directed by Elijah Bustos, UCB Productions).The band hooked up with friends The Henchmen and organized a full US tour in the summer of 2011. A success, the band gained wide exposure among fresh music scenes nationwide. In October 2011, the band officially added Monty O'Blivion to their lineup, on auxiliary guitar and backing vocals.
