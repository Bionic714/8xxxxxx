The Limit Club - Phantom Cats (2008) mp3 


The Limit Club (Phoenix) first formed in 2005 with members Nick Feratu, George and Cadaverous Joel. They began to write and compose songs, which would be released on the album God Damn the Limit Club in 2007. The band choose to remain independent, recording and releasing the album themselves. After its completion, George decided to leave the band to focus on his education. The band recruited drummer Juan Carlos shortly after George left, and completed a short West coast tour in support of their then new album.
 
In September 2008 the band pounded out another album, entitled Phantom Cats. Around this time, The Quakes, an American Psychobilly band based in Phoenix, recruited Juan Carlos to play drums for them. This position would influence Juan's playing style from a standard sit-down drumkit, to working as an upright drummer. Tensions came to a boiling point within The Limit Club and Cadaverous Joel was asked to leave. Nicholas David (NickDave) was then recruited to fill the position of bassist.
