,Swanee1,2013-04-20T01:07Z,Thanks for the upload but IMDB dont seem to have this title. Do you have any other information about the movie?
,Swanee1,2013-04-20T01:08Z,Unless you mean The Blitz 2011?
,Swanee1,2013-04-20T01:09Z,"In fact, the only one I can find is 'Blitz' 2011"
,crumrugin,2013-04-20T08:10Z,Blitz 2011 is not a WWII film as this one appears to be from the screen shots
,crumrugin,2013-04-20T08:16Z,"the uploader  of this film listed below provides INFO

,crumrugin,2013-04-20T08:53Z,"I recommend this one as i dled both and this has multi subs that work in vlc (English subs, this is Danish or something) tho it is in an extra container while the other one the subs dont work"
,crumrugin,2013-04-20T09:10Z,"It is in Dutch with multi -subs not Danish like I stated ,Sorry"
,crumrugin,2013-04-20T09:41Z,gets 2.8 and from what I've seen so far that is being generous ..It just is too breezy and smiley to be taking place while the nazis are running amok on your country
