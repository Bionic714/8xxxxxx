Oriental Arms 1 with Katia - Bellydance DVD

Full DVD, use Nero to burn files.
AVI will be available later this evening if you prefer.

Found myself disappointed by this. Another over priced DVD.
47mins only
Its short and the quality is poor, the dancers originally made these on VHS and it has just been transferred to DVD by her with no remastering etc to improve the image. Which is a shame.
I think its way to short and should have been a lot longer for the price.
It does have some useful armwork on it, but not that much.

I don't currently have Vol 2, so do not ask me for it.
