,JamsBand,2013-04-23T15:47Z,I did not like the movie. The good idea of a plot could of gone well but the storyline ended up being stupid as well as the direction and ending. 2 out of 5.

,skulldragon,2013-04-29T00:38Z,"I would like to say that this movie has shit sound peaks, aka whispering talk and eardrum piercing, speaker bursting +120db when action, but it actually suits this horrormovie. Plenty jumpscares this way.
Worth watching once, but not more, since the ending was lame and I value my ears and my speakers."

Not scary what so ever. Very unrealistic ghost.
No scary scenes. Shite special FX.
Just a crap movie, unfortunately."
,bravo95,2013-05-02T02:32Z,Thanks!
,Rush,2013-05-02T05:16Z,"Watch the first hour then turn it off. It will be the scariest one hour of your life.

 If you watch the last 30 minutes you will be the most disappointed of your life. 

Violently throwing shit at your big screen praying for it to end. "
