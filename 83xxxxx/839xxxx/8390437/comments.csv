,nekizaforo,2013-04-20T15:29Z,"Works perfectly on S3.
Thank you!
(For those who have problems with the installation:
1. You need to delete sygic program AND folder Sygic on your phone.

2. Copy folder Sygic FROM  Sygic_13.1.1_Full_SP TO ROOT in sd-card (this is NOT your external sd card)

3. Copy Sygic_13.1.1_Full_SP.apk to ROOT in sd-card AND INSTALL the app.

3. Once you downloaded maps, you just move them to folder Maps in Sygic.

When maps are downloaded (on your computer, of course) you get new folder Sygic and subfolder Maps with ALL Europe countries (if you choose Europe). Just choose the country(ies) you want, for exp. Italia is the folder ita.ta.2012.10 - you copy and paste this folder(ita.ta.2012.10 ) to folder Maps in folder Sygic ON YOUR SD-card)

4. Enjoy"

Can you patch or crack this one like you did with 12.2.2 . This one can easily obtained from the play store. Its not working. I tried it more than 10 times. Now I cant get 13.1.0 to work either.  I tried luck patcher but no success."

,alibabe,2013-04-27T02:39Z,"Thank you, ScorpioPirate! You are my navigator :)
It works on my old ph with gingerbread. I installed in the ph's memory rather than external SD (wouldn't work). I did not use map downloader; I just replaced USA maps from your previous post."

,nu_vas,2013-05-05T12:07Z,"When i open Sygic, the program tells me that i should buy it or activate/restore previous purchases. What should i do?
And can i keep the maps on external MicroSD card, or they should be on the phone memory?"
,hightmare,2013-05-07T22:18Z,what does the loquendo tts do i need it and which files for greece because it is too large
,aymbrbr,2013-05-14T20:57Z,I followed the instructions and it is still asking for activation. Will downgrade again. What a waste :(
,freakadude,2013-05-15T10:11Z,"@ScorpioPirate, any chance you can check on the middle east maps, particularly israel?
i tried copying the isr folder to the maps folder on the galaxy2, but the app doesn't seem to recognize it.
italy and czech republik work fine in the same way.
thanks"
,Rider658,2013-05-19T04:01Z,Tried instructions from ScorpioPirate the from nekizaforo - both times all I get when the program starts is a black screen.  I can tell that it is some kind of splash screen because I can see a little bit of text at the very top edge of the screen.  It is not force closing but simply stopping at this screen.  Any ideas?
,heisenbergs_cat,2013-05-27T01:48Z,"Just tried on a 2.3 android phone - works perfectly, without any cracking! I've downloaded the maps in linux via commandline, downloading the files listed in the .txt"
,Archonin2,2013-05-31T11:30Z,"Great torrents, works like a charm on my Galaxy Tab 2 7"" ^^"
,slipnerd,2013-06-06T07:25Z,"Working fine, very easy to install, thanks a lot!
Btw, it doesn't recognize the old favourites file (items.dat - 11.2.6 version)."
,br_shadow,2013-06-07T16:22Z,Does it need rooted android?
,MrK4life,2013-06-09T22:17Z,"thanks a lot ScorpioPirate, you doing a great job, your torrents are just fantastic.
