,Sbsaks,2013-04-27T16:06Z,"Guys, this torrent is from the Russian website rutracker dot org. For those not familiar with Russian, (neither am I) please install google chrome and install/ enable the language translation toolbar. This is a very nifty feature of Google Chrome.

Once you open the site in Chrome browser, everything will get translated to the language of your choice. You can then become a member and download the torrents of your choice. 

Tip: I typed 1308 in their search engine to get this torrent. Other search keywords like Jeppesen, Jeppview do not yield the desired results.

This little info is aimed at those seemingly technologically challenged people who keep on asking for PS version of JeppFD despite them being available on the Rouski website at times much before some kind bloke posts them here.

Wish you all happy landings"
