,metafaniel,2013-05-15T16:29Z,"HI! I've downloaded this torrent and I've installed Substance Designer 3, but the patch seems to be is not working. If I try to patch the existent substance_designer.exe the patch programs says ""Over write it?"" I say yes then i get ""Patch failed"". If I patch in any folder it creates the exe file, but when I replace the original with the patched one I get ""Cannot find 'freeimage.dll'. Please, re-install this application"" even if I can see this file. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG? Please help, thanks!! =)"
