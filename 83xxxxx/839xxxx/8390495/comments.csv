@dehou: via which torents do you try to download the missing parts?  

part 128, 245, 265 & 266 is included in 
HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC   VOL .1  (parts 1- 300).torrent

part 341 is included in 
HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC  Vol. 02 (parts 301-400).torrent

Both of them are alive and will be supported.

Or do you dowload via older and/or single part torrents?

Let me know - I'll serve you. Your friend Tom"
