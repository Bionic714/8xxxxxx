NOT THE BEATLES ALBUM

Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a multi-platinum double album
produced by George Martin, featuring covers of songs by The Beatles. It was
released in July 1978, as the soundtrack to the film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band, which starred the Bee Gees, Peter Frampton and Steve
Martin.

The project was managed by The Robert Stigwood Organisation. In 1975 the
original plans for the album were suspended due to a dispute between
Columbia and RSO. RSO invested $12 million into this soundtrack and the profit
offset set against costs such as $1 million for promotion.

Although Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band debuted at #5 in the U.S.
Billboard album charts and stayed there for six weeks, becoming a multi-
platinum album, there was reported resistance to the interpretation of The
Beatles' songs, such as Martin's comedic take on "Maxwell's Silver Hammer".
However Earth, Wind & Fire's version of "Got To Get You Into My Life" became
a million selling single and Aerosmith's "Come Together" charted in the top 40
and later appeared on the soundtrack for Armageddon.

Radio airplay trailed off when the film was released with poor reviews, only
five weeks later. The album immediately dropped out of the top 100 and
pre-sale shipments to USA failed to sell in the quantities predicted. Owing to
low box office receipts the film failed to make back its production costs, but
profits from the soundtrack album and the successful singles it spawned later
covered those losses.
