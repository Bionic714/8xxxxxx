All the El Shaddai videos and notes are FREE to anyone by going to the El Shaddai ministries website.Then scroll down and click on ARCHIVES.Then you look through the past teaching.It takes some searching.DL's are faster at their site.

Make a copy of the El Shaddai notes, they go along with the video.The other video offers some info. But El Shaddai is the best source to use.If you don't have time to watch the video- Look at all the slides and then listen to the mp3 while on the go.

 I am just trying to make it easier for more people to share this information. I encourage you to seed this and share with others. Support El Shaddai ministries, if you can. There are services every Saturday that are live streamed on the Web. They can later be downloaded.  


Please leave a comment if you find these lessons helpful.If there is interest, I will add more lessons. 

There are dark days coming to this world. We have nothing to fear in this world if we place our faith and will in the hand of God. Yeshua will be our covering. We must be a blessing to Israel for God to bless us. Be weary of people who think they have replaced the Jews or want to persecute the Jews.
