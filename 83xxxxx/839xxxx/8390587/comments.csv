,JAB69,2013-04-20T17:04Z,"Apple made some changes in iOS 6 where the .app (dot app) folder within an app directory is read-only and cannot be modified or written to, there is still read/write access in any other app subdirectory such as Documents or Library, same as in previous iOS versions. All iOS transfer utility software will have the same limitation with iOS 6, and jailbreaking the device is the only way around this currently. Try: http://evasi0n.com"

,bruiserbruiser,2013-04-23T19:59Z,"Hi I am using JeppFD 2.0.0. I have been updating just the TermCharts by copying and pasting the Termcharts downloaded from here to my IPAD's JeppFD TermCharts folder using Itools. So far it has worked for me. However this copy and paste method does not seem to work for cycle 1308. Error messages like""Saving the file  'font23.jtf' failed as it might be in use at the moment"" come up when I try to paste the downloaded TermCharts folder into my Ipad. 

My IOS is still 5.1.1. Can someone help please?"
,bruiserbruiser,2013-04-23T20:36Z,Disregard the above. It is my hard drive issue. Sorted it out. The seed is great. Thanks!

,FlyboyX1,2013-04-25T22:31Z,"@Lokito

just replace the content of the 2 directories ""Enroute"" and ""TermCharts"" in the DEMO folder!!! not in the Documents folder by the content of those of this file (1308 IPAD) here. "
