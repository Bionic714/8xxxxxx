 NOTE:

Our good friend Crywolf just released his new EP Ghosts to the world through Always Never Records, an EP that will surely put him further on the map and escalate him into a massive second half of 2013.
 Not only is this a banging set of EDM masterpieces that sum up the energy that we love most about electronic music, but I feel like it really goes deeper than that.
 You will find tracks like The Moon Is Falling Down and Walls that will have you jumping and bobbing your head, and also tracks like Swimming In The Flood and Ghosts that invoke a softer Indie vibe that really show Crywolf's extreme talent as a producer and visionary.
 I could sit and talk about how much I love this EP all day but you really just need to listen to it for yourself and let Justin's vocals and meaningful production tell the story.
 One of my favorite EP's of 2013 by far!
