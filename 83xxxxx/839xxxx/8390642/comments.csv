,NikkoTiN,2013-06-05T20:30Z,"I can't seem to get the activation to work, after I enter the activation code it says: ""The automatic activation over the internet has failed."" And with following instructions in going to either their activation site or by contacting their support in order to get an unlocking code?

Is this supposed to happen? Am I supposed to get a working unlocking code from the keygen to enter in the window that pops up with that message?"
