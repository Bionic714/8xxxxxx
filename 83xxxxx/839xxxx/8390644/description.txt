Deep within the hallowed walls of Ivy League's most prominent campus, there exists a secret society where power and influence are bred. Only a few are chosen to join the group where presidents are groomed, wealthy bloodlines bond, and devious plots are hatched. For Luke McNamara (Joshua Jackson), an invitation to join the prestigious secret college organization, The Skulls, is a dream come true. But when a fellow pledge gets caught up in murder, Luke finds himself alone amidst the sinister and well-connected brotherhood and now he must summon the strength to stand up against immeasurable odds.
