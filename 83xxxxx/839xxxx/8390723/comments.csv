,SteelerJ17,2013-04-20T16:23Z,"@daldan9626  I can get you Set It Off, but what version do you prefer? Theatrical or Director's Cut? The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia has not come out on DVD yet. As for the other request. I only do movies. TV is just too much for me. Please understand.  "
,daldan9626,2013-04-21T13:21Z,Director's Cut would be great
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T16:14Z,@daldan9626 I'll upload Set It Off today. So be on the look out for it
,daldan9626,2013-04-21T16:46Z,Great and thanks. Can you look into Exorcismus. Also will these all have menus and or special features?
,daldan9626,2013-04-21T16:47Z,Also the haunting movie I asked for came out 2 weeks ago.
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T23:45Z,@daldan9626 Most of my torrents will have menus and special features. I'm on hold for Haunting in Connecticut 2 at my local library.
