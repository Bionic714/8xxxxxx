The Journey is the ninth studio album by Scottish rock band Big Country, released on 8 April 2013 through Cherry Red Records. Joseph Kyle of The Big Takeover praised the band's selection of Peters to fill the void left by Adamson, calling him "the best man for the job." He concludes his review by writing, "The Journey is easily one of the best records of the year, a surprising return for a band no one expected to return, and a proud continuation of Stuart AdamsonΓÇÖs legacy."
