Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On this important Friday, April 19 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the rapidly developing story emerging on the Boston Marathon terror bombing and its two shadowy suspects identified on Thursday by the FBI. One suspect was killed by police last night and the other remains on the loose as authorities in Beantown impose a lockdown on the city and respond with a heavy-handed presence that resembles martial law. 

On today's show, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo talks with Alex in-studio.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
