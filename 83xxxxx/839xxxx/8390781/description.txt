For four years, Jessica Stern interviewed extremist members of three religions around the world: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. Traveling extensivelyΓÇöto refugee camps in Lebanon, to religious schools in Pakistan, to prisons in Amman, Asqelon, and PensacolaΓÇöshe discovered that the Islamic jihadi in the mountains of Pakistan and the Christian fundamentalist bomber in Oklahoma have much in common.
 
Based on her vast research, Stern lucidly explains how terrorist organizations are formed by opportunistic leaders whoΓÇöusing religion as both motivation and justificationΓÇörecruit the disenfranchised. She depicts how moral fervor is transformed into sophisticated organizations that strive for money, power, and attention.
 
Jessica Stern's extensive interaction with the faces behind the terror provide unprecedented insight into acts of inexplicable horror, and enable her to suggest how terrorism can most effectively be countered.
 
A crucial book on terrorism, Terror in the Name of God is a brilliant and thought-provoking work.
