The Everyday Wok Cookbook: Simple and Satisfying Recipes for the Most Versatile Pan in Your Kitchen


Most people think a wok is just for stir-frying Chinese food. Not so! A wok is a versatile and inexpensive piece of kitchen equipment that can be used everyday, for all your meals. You can braise, steam, deep-fry, and stew foods in it. You can even bake a cake in it! Don't stash your wok away in a cupboard. Leave it on your stovetop and use it every day!
 
This book celebrates making American favorites such as spaghetti and meatballs, buttermilk fried chicken, and pulled pork sandwiches using the ancient Chinese cooking vessel. You'll also find easy Asian dishes like kung pao chicken, shrimp and egg fried rice, stir-fried beef and broccoli, and chicken chow mein.
