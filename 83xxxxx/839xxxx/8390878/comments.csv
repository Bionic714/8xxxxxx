REASON: 2hd has a 90 second length scroller. Three times the maximum allowed.
SUCCESSOR: Happy.Endings.S03E20.HDTV.x264.PROPER-LOL

My thoughts... Kinda bs. To my knoweledge, All airings of 3x20 contained a scroller with news of the capture of the Boston Marthon bomber. Other than the scroller, there is nothing wrong with this release.

Note: There are two epsides scheduled for tonight.
3x20 -- Apr 19, 2013 -- The Ballad of Lon Sarofsky
3x21 -- Apr 19, 2013 -- Unsabotagable
However, due to the news coverage of the capture of the Boston Marathon bomber suspect #2, most or all networks have preemted (postponed?) episode 21. We will have to wait and see if/when episode 21 is aired and capped.

,drngr,2013-04-20T05:08Z,LOL/DIMENSION's source is preair and logoless. That's why they have no scroll.
,mwalsher,2013-04-20T05:55Z,"Both episodes of this (as well as other shows that were preempted tonight) were aired in other regions like Canada, so hopefully someone in one of those regions capped it."

Only the first episode was aired, in Canada, that is why we have it....but the second episode was not aired anywhere that I am aware of. No word yet if it will be available OnDemand before next week or what the network's plans are.
