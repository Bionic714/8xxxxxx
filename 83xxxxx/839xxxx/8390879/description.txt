Microsoft DirectX is a collection of APIs that deal with tasks related to game programming for the Microsoft Windows operating system, that is, who standardizes communication between software and hardware. With the standardization of communication, DirectX provides instructions for applications (games, graphics programs, and among others, that are written for the purpose of its use), and the related hardware, making use of its resources. DirectX was originally distributed by game developers along with their products, but was later included in Windows.
