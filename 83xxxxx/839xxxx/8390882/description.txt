A new series featuring a team up between Ghost, X, and Doctor Midnight.

From Comic Book Resources:

Dark Horse Comics has proven itself willing to do different things when it comes to digital comics, but tucked away in the waves of news coming out of New York Comic Con was a new kind of digital release from the publisher -- one that again involves its resurgent imprint of "Comics' Greatest World" characters.

As announced during the convention, Dark Horse will soon unveil two new digital first projects: a Conan series called "Phantoms of the Black Coast" and the "C.G.W." series "2 Past Midnight," which crosses Dark Horse's marquee heroes Ghost and X with the Golden Age revival of Captain Midnight. "2 Past Midnight" will be written by Duane Swierczynski with art from Eduardo Francisco, under a cover by Paolo Rivera.

Both projects will be initially offered as rewards for consumers who have the incoming ePlate credit card from Pittsburgh-based tech company Dynamics, Inc. The idea behind the battery-powered card is its patented design allows owners to register their credit accounts with companies like Dark Horse to earn rewards. The system is much like a credit card earning airline miles, however the technology means users can decide which of their purchases will specifically apply to a range of companies offering rewards.

Ahead of its launch, the ePlate card has already signed on for rewards programs with geek-friendly companies like Upper Deck trading cards and Evil Genius Games, and in the case of the Dark Horse program, purchases made on the ePlate card will earn users pages of these new comics. Once a card owner has gained the full amount of story pages, they'll receive access to the full digital comic in the Dark Horse app and eventually a free print edition as well.
