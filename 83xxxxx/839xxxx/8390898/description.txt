From the rules
- Scrolling or other alert messages added by a station (e.g. weather,
Amber alerts) must be at least 30 seconds in length in order to
nuke/proper

2hd has a 90 second length scroller. Three times the maximum allowed. Would think
after all the scroller propers in their history they would have had the common
decency to not pre.
