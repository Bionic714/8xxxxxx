3x20 -- Apr 19, 2013 -- The Ballad of Lon Sarofsky
3x21 -- Apr 19, 2013 -- Unsabotagable
However, due to the news coverage of the capture of the Boston Marathon bomber suspect #2, most or all networks have preemted (postponed?) episode 21. We will have to wait and see if/when episode 21 is aired and capped.
