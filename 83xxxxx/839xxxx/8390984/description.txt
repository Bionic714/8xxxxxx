From the rules

- Scrolling or other alert messages added by a station (e.g. weather,
Amber alerts) must be at least 30 seconds in length in order to
nuke/proper

2hd has a 90 second length scroller concerning
Boston. Seeing how they mention the scroller
in their nfo, they know they should have never
pred it. Plus now you get better quality with
a smaller file size

The Ballad of Lon Sarofsky

The gang is shocked when Penny rebounds from
her breakup with Pete by having a torrid
affair with the last man on earth they'd pick
for her -- the Car Czar. To make matters
worse, she's temporarily living with Brad and
Jane, who end up acting like disapproving
parents. Meanwhile the friends pressure Max
to get a job so he'll stop sponging off them.
He decides to enter the "Mr. Gay Gay Chicago"
pageant, with Alex and Dave as his coaches
