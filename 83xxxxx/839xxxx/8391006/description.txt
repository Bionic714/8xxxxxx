Ring of Fire

Nick (David Giuntoli) finds himself
fighting a wildly different sort of
nature freak in a desperate attempt
to keep a volcano from burying
Portland in lava. Meanwhile a
pregnant Adalind (Claire Coffee)
meets a powerful new ally (guest
star Shohreh Aghdashloo) in Europe.
Meanwhile, Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch)
seeks out help after becoming
overwhelmed by the latest side
effect of her recovery - multiple
memories of Nick showing up
everywhere. This show is not worth
the effort of me coming up with a
creative way to bash it today
