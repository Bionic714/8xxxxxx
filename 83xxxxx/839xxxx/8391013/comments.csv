While I've heard every single one of these tracks before, I didn't listen to most of the MP3s I downloaded (downloaded all of them since the songs I had in my library are all 128 quality). 

I was able to do quality control with some (replacing them with non-glitched versions), but it would be a great help if anyone can point anything that truly doesn't play correctly once your download is finished. Peace."
