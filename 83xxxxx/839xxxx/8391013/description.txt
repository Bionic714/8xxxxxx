This is the complete collection from Pitchfork's list of the best songs of the 1960s.

To the best of my knowledge, these are the same versions of the tracks that appeared on the list. Over 75% of them are presented in 320kbps quality and the rest are all of listenable quality. Knock yourself out if you want to replace the lower quality ones with others on the web.

Also, about ten of the tracks aren't sorted the same way in the folder. I have no idea why that is (I can't change the property details on those files), but they're currently sorted in my iTunes correctly. Regardless, it should take you all of 10 seconds to fix that in iTunes if you're really anal. 

This is my first torrent and I'm on DSL, so please seed for as long as you can. Also, if you're interested, I have some future projects in the works involving Pitchfork lists and producer boxed sets (Timbaland, Phil Spector, Brian Eno, etc.). Hit me up if you'd like to help as I'd like to start a music compiler's group.
