In his four-decade career Elton John has sold more than 250 million records, making him one of the most successful artists of all time.

From 1970 to 1976 he wrote an extraordinary collection of songs.
Those albums were re-mastered and reissued in 1995 under the banner The Classic Years. Below are 9 of those albums.

I have also added in Blue Moves (not in the Classic Years collection) that was re-mastered  and reissued in 1996. It was his last great album from that period.
