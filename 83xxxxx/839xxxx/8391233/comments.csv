,Barkingside,2013-04-20T08:39Z,What is this doing here? Should be posting it at any of the recognised MSFS sites but not here.
,benclark,2013-04-20T10:54Z,"If you're a MSFS user you'll know about the AVSIM hack that took down the entire library (you'll also might recognise my name if you enjoy AI aircraft), large file sites are always at risk from that so now I'm slowly returning back to creating files I decided to see about using torrents legitimately (doesn't all have to be mp3's and ripped dvd's lol) to distribute my files as a way to not only make everyone's downloads faster on larger files (this isn't one of them ;-) ) but to also protect them against the kind of losses that are suffered by hacks. I am distributing the torrent file via FS related websites but figured a piratebay link would be a good thing to have for some people. This is very much experimental right now and if it works will lead to me uploading my larger files where the true ability of torrent will be realised."
,turontado117,2013-04-20T13:33Z,you sounded familiar i think youre one of the AI makers from WOAI
,benclark,2013-04-20T16:22Z,Yup they have permission to use my files. I was/still am part of Alpha India Group and for a while had my own website before packing things in after the birth of my son. My interest didn't wane for long though lol.
,Barkingside,2013-04-20T22:29Z,"I understand but unless people keep seeding the files die a natural death, whereas posting to Avsim fs.com simviation, SOH etc etc they will live forever(ish). Putting stuff on here is just a little bit shameful don't you think?"
,potvinsuks,2013-04-21T00:52Z,"Shameful?  Lol.  You're stereotyping torrents as if all of it is being used illegally, which is not the case.  Even REX puts up there files on torrent sites to make d-loading more efficient.  You obviously didn't read his response."
,benclark,2013-04-21T01:58Z,"Thanks potvinsuks, torrents shouldn't need to be illegal to be worthwhile. Not quite sure why barkingside feels a legit torrent is shameful. I'm one of the ""few"" hard working freeware developers that provide all the work I do for free, no shame felt here."
,aarque,2013-04-21T18:17Z,"benclark, many legitimate software providers distribute their content via the BitTorrent protocol, this is nothing new. 
You should look into appropriate torrent trackers. I would caution you that the general public is reluctant to install BitTorrent software, because of it's association with warez and a legitimate fear that they will be scrutinized or prosecuted for using Bit Torrent. Additionally, I have worked for a local ISP and they DO carefully monitor BitTorrent transactions, for two reasons: they are required to by law and the BitTorrent protocol is very hard on network infrastructure, especially VoIP. In one extreme case we had to replace a clients' equipment to remove his torrent laden signal from the VoIP network. We did not report him, but I happened to mention to his daughter that we were compensating for his torrenting and a few hours later he called the office and (probably pretended to) almost suspend service. It is a very sensitive subject, the whole Bit Torrent thing.

But you mistake. Regardless of your chosen protocol, The Pirate Bay is a torrent TRACKER. As a tracker, it is a valuable resource for people looking for a specific type of software. Can you guess what type of software TPB was created to track? That is correct, it was created to track WAREZ. 

We should all list our torrents is the appropriate trackers to keep the trackers relevant and accurate. You can do what you want, but I'm thinking by listing here, you are associating yourself with piracy to whomever encounters your software.

Finally, Barkingside is essentially correct. To accomplish the immortality you intend, you are asking people to seed your files indefinitely into the future. That I will not do. I have a very limited connection and I cannot afford back round seeding for the terrabytes of stuff I have already gotten here. I am grateful for those who do still seed my original torrents - I don't and yes, it would be shameful of me to expect them to continue."
,Barkingside,2013-04-24T20:37Z,Yay you put it on Avsim :-)
