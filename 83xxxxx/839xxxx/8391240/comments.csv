avi is proprietary to Intel.  

Thanks for the upload!"
,logan-x-art,2013-04-20T16:39Z,"World Wide standard...hahaha...

Sure thing...

Thats what the scene groups told you...

264 shit jumps around, lags, is blocky as fuck and you guys are calling it the standard...

Funny how the scene groups all post the same 264 shit...

And you fucking monkeys eat it up..."
,logan-x-art,2013-04-20T16:48Z,264 is Shite...will always be shite...
[V],politux,2013-04-20T19:46Z,x264 is highly superior to xvid.  Avi is a container not a codec.  Get some decent hardware and use a proper operating system and you don't have to worry about formats.
