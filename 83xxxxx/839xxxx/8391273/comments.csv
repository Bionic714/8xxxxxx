,DTake2012,2013-04-20T19:31Z,Non-720p version please!
,Riaz1987,2013-04-21T09:12Z,This episode viewed just fine on my desktop. File size was a bit smaller than usual but thanks for the upload!
,DTake2012,2013-04-21T16:36Z,"My screen doesn't support 720p, it lags like a mofo.

Regular AVI/MP4 would be great."
,DTake2012,2013-04-24T05:44Z,"Any different uploads for the episode?

PLEASE!"
