,masething,2013-04-21T02:46Z,"I can tell you right out the gate (without even downloading the torrent) that you're missing half of Season 1.

As these are DEiMOS rips, I'm not even sure which half of Season 1 is in the zip files you have in here. DEiMOS, for some unknown reason, only ripped episodes 31 - 60 for Season 1... To my knowledge"
,Withoutknowledge,2013-04-21T02:54Z," Seeders! 

Come on, Guys!"
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-21T12:18Z,"@masething

Holy shit, I never noticed that and you are right. I will have to do something about this.... I don't know what though.
And you know why i never notices this? It was because I have another RIP (TVRip) and confused it with this one.... FUCK FUCK FUCK.

Thanks for making me notice this.

@Withoutknowledge
I'm seeding alone at 10Mbit and already seeded 60Gbs. I wish I had a bigger connection :("
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-21T12:26Z,"Actually, I just found out that DEiMOS ripped all the episodes and I found them.
I'm in the process of download them and I will make another torrent after someone hits this 100%
So yeah. :D"
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-21T21:00Z,"Here are the missing episodes from Season 1 on this torrent!!

,masething,2013-04-24T02:58Z,Don't worry about it. I've got every episode of TV rips in the same folder and I'm slowly replacing them with the DVD rips so things do get confusing.
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-24T05:44Z,"Thank you
And, thanks (even if you did or not) for downloading and seeding.

:d"

Well, please, do.

Movies are coming as soon as I can encode the MMPR movie properly."
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-27T23:07Z,"I have the movie encoded (I only really needed to encode the MMPR Movie as the Turbo movie is already in the proper ""format/resolution/container) and I'm preparing the package. It will have some extra stuff with it.
So, be prepared, everyone!!"
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-28T09:05Z,"The movies are UP people!
