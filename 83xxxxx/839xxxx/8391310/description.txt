So, I aranged everything in a pack. I think nothing is missing but let me know. Also, let me know of any mistakes. I tend to do a lot of those.
 
The S04 if you are wondering is "Mighty Morphin' Alien Rangers". It counts as  part of "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers", so yeah.

Values may vary per episode. But, they are pretty consistent.
The quality is the best you can get at this moment when it comes to DVD-Rips.

I also have included the Extras he ripped.
Amazing stuff. Any MMPR fan should have this (OR THE DAMN DVD'S. I do.)


Enjoy and seed back. This is a big thing.
