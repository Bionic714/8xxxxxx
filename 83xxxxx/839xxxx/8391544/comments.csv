,GaNomez,2013-04-21T03:00Z,"Having a hard time getting this guy to work. Not quite clear on the patch process. Can someone give me a bit of a walk-through?

I've unzipped the folders with 7-Zip, but when I try to run the patch it keeps saying that the file is active, so it won't patch. If I just try to run the program, it tells me ""Open GL1.4 renderer not supported"""
