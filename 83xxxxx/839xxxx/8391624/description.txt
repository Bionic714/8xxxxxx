 PLOT INFO:
 Just as CABIN IN THE WOODS shook up the horror world with its slick satirizing of the tried and true trope of its titular namesake, RESOLUTION similarly conjures a deftly meta excursion into the genre in a fashion that feels original, absorbing and damn creepy. In a cabin by the woods, a junkie is visited by his estranged best friend in a desperate bid to rehabilitate him. As they rekindle their friendship in the dilapidated abode, they soon find themselves accosted by increasingly sinister neighboring forces, while stumbling upon a series of interconnected media (from diaries to VHS tapes) that surreally begin to embroil them in a supernatural plot that pervades both the cabin and its surroundings.

 NOTES: 
 This was done a bit different than our usual VOD output, hence the title "WEBRiP", but the output is just as good as any "HDRiP" you've seen. Some of you will highly appreciate this movie, because it's an extremely well made, intelligent film. Some of you will hate it, because there aren't constant explosions or CGI monsters. You have to actually pay attention to this one. 

 AXED! We do this better.
