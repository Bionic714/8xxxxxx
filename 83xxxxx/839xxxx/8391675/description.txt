History

Tarakany! began in Moscow, Russia in 1991. Tarakany! was one of the first punk bands to emerge from the new Russian Federation after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
For the first 12 years of the band's life, Tarakany! has released nine albums and performed in more than 800 concerts. Until 2004, Tarakany! was relatively unknown outside their home country. This has changed with the release of their 10th album, Freedom Street, now available on Zurich Chainsaw Massacre Records.
They've toured Japan as well as parts of Europe, along with touring and playing large festivals in Russia. In 2003 Tarakany! organized a Russian tour, which ended with three shows in collaboration project with Marky Ramone under the name Marky Ramone & The Pinhead Army.
In January 2005, Tarakany! toured Europe with Marky Ramone on a special Ramones Night tour. Tarakany! played a set of their own material and then played a set of Ramones material with Marky on drums.
Tarakany! has been influenced by the Ramones, Bad Religion, Pennywise, TSOL and others. While being labeled a punk band, they also incorporate influences from ska, metal, and other genres into their music.
