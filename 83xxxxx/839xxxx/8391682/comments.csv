[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-04-20T19:42Z,"@_whoa_: This is already unpacked. The files you get when downloading this torrent is what you will get when you unpack those rar files, and i've done that for you :)"

HOPEFULLY the annoying, pointless and ultimately OUTDATED mass of RAR files are in 1999, where they belong.
I understand that you are one of those lemmings that bow down and worship the ""scene"" like some kind of false idol, but internet bandwidth has improved in the last 14 years, and all those RAR files are just not wanted or needed by 99.9999999% of us here on TPB. We appreciate the unpacked and ready to use files provided by wonderful folks like Stifmeister.

None of the uploaders you troll with your comments every friggin day are being disrespectful of the ""scene"" you so cherish, they just provide the vast majority that don't give a good goddamn about that rubbish a way to DL usable files without the hassle. 

Please, stop trolling. It's pointless and annoying... just like all those damn RAR files you keep whining about.


Hey, Stifmeister... THANKS man, you ROCK THE HELL ON, guy!"

,misterburnz,2013-04-21T18:43Z,"The 73 RAR files are crawling across the internet, you're going to have to play hide-n-seek to find all 73, kind of like Pok-e-Mon. Gotta catch 'em all if you really wanna play this game for free...
