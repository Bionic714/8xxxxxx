Anyone know if 1080p will find it's way to public consumption?"
,Seaford,2013-04-20T22:28Z,Thank you for this - Wondered if ypu're doing the Enterprise Blu Ray also.  It would also be appreciated
,theurbs,2013-04-21T12:17Z,Anyone know if there's a 1080p version online yet?
,theurbs,2013-04-22T00:26Z,Whining will get you everywhere ;).
,Wudan,2013-04-24T15:34Z,Thankyou!
,Getabrain,2013-04-25T08:45Z,"Nice! But the names... what a mess!... Do we get seasons 4, 5, 6 et 7 soon?"
,theurbs,2013-04-26T01:08Z,"Season 4 is to be released July 2013; the other release dates are not yet known. Based on past releases, I'd be willing to bet Season 5 will be out October/November 2013, Season 6 Q2 2014 and Season 7 Q4 2014. But obviously, this is just speculation right now.

But please, purchase as many seasons as you can. If the sales numbers are high enough, CBS has gone on record as saying they'll put a fully remastered DS9 on Blu-ray as well..."
,Getabrain,2013-04-26T21:20Z,Thanks Theurbs!
[V],meech,2013-04-27T18:00Z,Spectacular...thanks a million!
,xaximus,2013-04-30T19:10Z,Thanks for this!! Any chance you could also upload the extras/commentary?
,TurdFurgeson,2013-05-01T01:52Z,The official release date of the season 3 bluray is today (4/30) so maybe someone will rip it soon.  And this is one of the stingiest swarms ever lol.
,theurbs,2013-05-01T02:57Z,If you wanted the extras... just pay for it ;).
,Torrenad000,2013-05-04T02:14Z,"Yes thanks a ton i've been waiting for this! Btw, they release a new season every 6 months"
,cohfan123,2013-05-07T01:10Z,"Is this the remastered HD version that was publicly released on April 30th?

And if so, why is nobody seeding this? Been uploading at 80KB/s and downloading at 25 KB/s for like 4-5 days... wtf?!"
,theurbs,2013-05-07T19:19Z,"a.) Yes, it's a high quality 720p rip of the blu-ray remaster.

b.) Shut up. I've been seeding at 10 mb/s for the past two weeks; just because you're not getting any of the pie doesn't mean that people aren't doing their share."
,cohfan123,2013-05-07T22:27Z,"a. Thanks for the answer, much appreciated!

b. I'm glad you're seeding, so why are you so angry bro? There's 3 seeds and 2500 leechers right now...  so my comment was to the people that AREN'T seeding maybe? "
,Torrenad000,2013-05-07T22:40Z,"Thanks for sharing thurbs, but most people are not doing their part. As the leechers increase the seeders go down which means alot of people dumping the torrent when their done. It's always the same with large size Star Trek files. C'mon people quit being so stingy ST is all about the spirit of helping out your fellow man."
,GlennJohnson,2013-05-10T06:52Z,I need warp speed. Lets see 60G at 1.3kbs .... Season 8 should be out by the time it's finished.
,W123.130,2013-05-12T12:24Z,"Terrible quality, need 1080p 90GB torrent."
,Torrenad000,2013-05-14T21:33Z,"A/V 10/10, I don't know what the last commenter is on about it looks incredible, you need bloody glasses mate."
,TheLathe,2013-05-15T06:39Z,"I think what it is, is NOT the terrible quality of BOZX's encode (not possible  : )  BUT...  it might just be the inherent look of the originals.  I know that for myself, parts of this season from this post look amazing and parts you just sit there and go 'WTF'...?!!  It's really weird, but literally scene to scene you just can't really be sure exactly how it's going to look.  I guess just some elements they had to do SOMETHING to in order for them to put together this  series in HD.

Some scenes have a frigg'n TON of grain and aliasing that was TOTALLY absent in the previous scene.  VERY weird is all I can say...

BUT I pretty much can assure you that it is NOT the encode done here for this torrent.

Cheers!

BTW, I DID snag some lossless torrents from BITSNOOP from the 1st season and they look frigg'n AWESOME!!!  So YEAH, I too would VERY much like to have all the TNG in lossless files if possible  : )"
,WingcommanderIV,2013-05-16T15:57Z,"Why hasn't anyone done a TV release? I mean the regular 350meg per episode that is more than clear enough for me. Hell, YIFY could hit that file size with a clear 720P picture, and yet this remains the only torrent of Season 3 almost a month later. Sorry we don't all have 100 TB server farms that allow us to keep all our shows at this resolution."
,Skram0,2013-05-17T08:23Z,"@WingcommanderIV
100 TB server.. Don't be such a drama queen. And 350MB per episode!? You like the shit quality, don't you. Put a 2.18GB episode side by side with a 350MB episode and you'll see some shit right there. I too would say a 40MB episode would be watchable, but jesus christ that would look like diarrhea on any screen larger than 4 inches."
,ngokunakekela,2013-05-17T15:56Z,Nice quality. I do hope you upload the extras!@!
,kira1985,2013-05-31T00:55Z,I can't tell if 2GB / ep is overkill or not. I wonder why releases like this do not tell which x264 profile/settings were used for encoding.
,danwat1234,2013-06-01T01:35Z,"@WingCommander, 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5133761/Star_Trek_-_The_Next_Generation

or search on TPB""star trek the next generation"" and sort by size and it'll be at the top. 358GB and it is the full DVD.
But, it isn't that much higher is quality than the ~50GB series rips.

Just download these big bluray RIPS because hard drives are cheap and you want quality I'm sure. "
,claudiu01us,2013-06-10T17:28Z,"Just a heads up, there is a 1080p version since yesterday over here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8558324/Star_Trek_TNG_Season_3_1080p

Get it while its hot :)"
