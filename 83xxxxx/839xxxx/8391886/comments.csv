Might as well make them MP3"
,pebh,2013-04-20T16:12Z,Vinyl a lossy source? Troll harder.
,Tboneben,2013-04-20T17:01Z,"Vinyl is shit!
The only possible exception is if the vinyl uses a different master, if the master for the CD has levels above 0db."
,Tboneben,2013-04-20T17:02Z,"And yes, vinyl by nature is lossy unless played in a hermetically sealed room with no dust."
,twistedneverland,2013-04-20T18:06Z,Tboneben No You're a Hermetically Sealed Room!
,twistedneverland,2013-04-20T18:09Z,No You Are
,pebh,2013-04-20T18:39Z,"You apparently have no clue what ""lossy"" is. I suggest a Google search. Thank you for a wonderful vinyl rip, twistedneverland! If you have Blur or Harry Nilsson vinyl rips I would greatly appreciate them :-)"
,Tboneben,2013-04-21T05:19Z,"Dust on vinyl causes loss of signal, therefore it is a lossy format!
Come into the 21st century!"

The terms lossy and lossless are defined by comparing the original studio master to the end product. In the case of vinyl records they provide a *virtually* lossless copy of the original studio master. Since audio data is stored in analog, in theory, it has a infinite bitrate, sample rate and bit depth. Since the record itself is considered the signal source during audio playback. It is highly possible that signal degradation may happen along the long and tedious transport chain to your ears. Any fault in any part of this chain (Cartridge, Tone Arm, Cabling, Pre-amp, power amp, ADC/Ears) results in less-than-perfect playback. 

However, a issue with any part along the playback/recording chain does not make the signal source lossy. It simply means that there was signal degradation on the way. In other words, if you have a crappy sound card and fall prey to heavy EMI during playback, would you call your audio source lossy (Assuming your using a lossless format)? I think not.

In theory, vinyl is better than CDs when played/recorded with decent equipment because it doesn't have the limit of 44.1KHz 16-bit sound."
,CPU_Terminator,2013-04-28T03:52Z,"Furthermore, the terms lossy and lossless are states that describe the type of medium not the state. A format of data can only be lossy if it causes UNRECOVERABLE loss of information. Take of instance the audio format FLAC. FLAC compresses sound data meaning it's throwing away information (hold your horses... Let me finish).. However this information is simply represented in another, more compact way, such that during playback the original information can be recovered from the file (therefore deeming it lossless).

Since lossy/lossless is a defined descriptor of the type of media. It cannot be used to describe the state of the media. For example: You cannot say... Oh my MP3 player is being more lossless today. This point would go on further to justify that you cannot say ""vinyl by nature is lossy unless played in a hermetically sealed room with no dust."" You could say ""RECORDING/PLAYING BACK vinyl is lossy unless played in a hermetically sealed room with no dust."" because dust it a major contribution towards signal degradation during the recording/playback process.

If all that above still cannot convince you of my point then please consider the following statements:

Recording CDs is lossy in nature unless done in a room COMPLETELY shielded from EMI and has a temperature best suited from EVERY semi-conductor during the recording process to prevent any sound loss. Not to mention that we need to record in infinite sample rate, infinite bit depth. I'm sure thats exactly what they do."
