,TaiTheGuy,2013-04-23T12:33Z,"This seems VERY impressive, by any standards- This film isn't released for another FIVE WEEKS!?!? And it's already here on TPB? Is it just me, or is that crazy?"
,Phatfish,2013-04-23T13:07Z,"@TaiTheGuy: What's wrong with you?


A - Good

V - Watchable but so so for being a dvdrip.

M - Pure kids movie. Nothing there at all for over 12s."
,arafel65,2013-04-24T14:37Z,What if the Movie was called Homo Bot? Disaster on arrival perhaps?
