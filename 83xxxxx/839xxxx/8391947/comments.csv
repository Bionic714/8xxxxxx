You have just uploaded the same file TVTeam did yesterday. That one already has quite a few seeders."
,totocon,2013-04-20T13:11Z,Thanks!
,mordokch,2013-04-20T13:17Z,well 'TVTeam' must have hidden their upload pretty well 'cos I can't find it. probably named it with no spaces so the PB search can't find it.
,miladjuckel,2013-04-20T13:58Z,"thats bullshit, i've been looking for practice 2 since yesterday, and footy is the first to put it up

,miladjuckel,2013-04-20T14:11Z,"alright in that case i do apologize for my last comment, i jumped to conclusions too fast

but how is that possible? is it the spacing or the periods that make a diff"

,egtorraptor,2013-04-20T14:59Z,"Why are you surprised geoff777 Footy always posts late Torrents. 

For example the qualifying for Bahrain has already been uploaded in 720 pixels an hour ago but Footy will upload a worse version after 5 hours and the comments will say ""Footy you are the best fastest uploader"" etc even though others post it 5 hours or even days before him. 

Most of the times he uploads the same files as the other uploaders after their torrents are done seeding so he downloads their files and recreates the torrent and uploads it which is cheating. Check the file sizes, for example if their files are for example 1.82 GB including screenshots and the text files you get with the torrent Footy's file is 1.81 GB, just the same race file after removing all the uploader notes text files and screens. 

So he posts the same or worse torrent without any information (the one line of description you get in the box above) with minimal effort and is the last uploader to upload it most of the time stealing it from others here and yet you all are surprised why he posts late when he does. 


"
,geoff777,2013-04-20T15:30Z,"Never really noticed before this torrent.

I can only guess that Footy has to much time on his/her hands and likes the attention.

Oh well not that big of a deal really, the first leechers could have found a faster dl.

C'mon Lewis ... love him to win this season."
,mordokch,2013-04-20T16:32Z,So it's exactly as I said - they named it Formula1.2013.Bahrain.Grand.Prix.Practice.Two.720p.HDTV.x264-FAI with no spaces (full stops instead). That's why it's not coming up in a search
,myjazzgirl,2013-04-21T01:35Z,"Well, I appreciate all the uploads no matter they are repeated or late, at least the uploaders have the hearts & willing to spend the time & money to upload them for the viewers, especially for those who cant't get F1 coverage from free to air TV in their country, like myself......So, thanks footy, keep up the good work!! Cheers!! ^^ 

For those downloaders who are bitching all the time, didn't you learn how to say ""thank you"" in school? Especially after you take something from someone? ^^"
