This story revolves around Malhar Gopaldas Agnihotri, a out-of-work actor, poor, and dependent on his father, who is heading for retirement. Malhar knows that he can act, very well indeed, all he needs is some encouragement, and some money. He gets neither. His father is abusive, and even gets physical with him openly in front of all the neighors, and even the neighborhood. Malhar loves a young lady named Apoorva Choudhury, but his affections are mis-applied, as Apoorva only regards him as a friend, and she loves Nihal Joshi, a Police Inspector. Frustrated at the lack of love and encouragement, Malhar takes recourse in an exercise, an exersise that will put him in direct confrontation with the law, as it starts with murder.
