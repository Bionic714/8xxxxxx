Hitman 2: Silent Assassin takes what's best from its predecessor and improves upon it, creating a top-notch stealth-action game with a gripping story and slick gameplay. Each mission is created with impressive attention to detail, and this level of complexity allows the player to find his or her own path to complete each assignment however seems best.

What you do and how you do it is entirely up to you, and as long the target is dead, the client is happy.
