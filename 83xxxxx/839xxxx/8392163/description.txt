How Anonymous Browsing Works

1] Anonymous browsing - how does it work

In a regular case your web browser connects to the web site directly. Thus revealing quite a lot of sensitive information. An orange arrow denotes this case in the block scheme.
To change this situation Proxy Switcher was written. It can be used to find working anonymous proxy servers and redirect requests through them.
