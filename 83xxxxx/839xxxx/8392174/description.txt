This torrent contains files that can be put on an SD card to update a Kenwood DNX9980HD car stereo/navigation head unit with the latest North American maps
from Garmin, their 2013.40 (February 2013) update.

You may want to apply the Garmin v2.2 firmware update before installing this SD
card with the map updates.  That update is available at:

  http://www8.garmin.com/support/collection.jsp?product=010-00857-20  

Instructions for installing are provided with the download.

To use the map update SD card, unpack the contents of the RAR files onto an SD
card that's at least 4GB large and formatted with the FAT32 filesystem.  Insert 
the SD card into your head unit and you should be good to go.  The SD card must
remain in the head unit.  If you remove it, you will revert to your original 
maps.

You can check the map info under Settings to confirm that your unit is actually
using the updated maps.

I learned everything I know about this process through the Kenwood DNX9980HD
Forum at http://www.kenwoodforums.com/viewforum.php?f=28  Go there if you need
help or if you want to explore alternate methods of updating your DNX9980HD.

The files on the SD card are:
