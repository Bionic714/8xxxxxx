The gods may be crazy! First the Almighty HE, the highest of all the gods, sends Jupiter, Horus, and ChΓÇÖib-Yu off into an extremely arduous competition simply on account of some occasional drinking sprees! Then the three gods are subjected to scorn and derision: Q'nqura, the goddess of the Amazons, lets the trio win in battle out of pure spite, and then their humiliation is complete!

The Settlers III: Ultimate Collection is a lavishly designed, strategy-filled civilization simulation where your industrious people construct buildings, produce goods, harvest crops, and conquer new lands in scintillating real-time battles! Will you heed the call of the gods and become their avatar?
