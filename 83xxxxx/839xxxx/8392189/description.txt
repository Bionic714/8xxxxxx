Combination Nation Vol 1: Belly Dance Instruction with America's Hottest Performers

Combination Nation is an instructional dvd featuring dancers from all over the United States (and one from Canada). Each instructor shares her favorite, signature-style steps and combinations. 

Each combination is broken down facing a mirror, as it would be in an actual workshop or dance class. We then drill each sequence to music for several minutes to allow you plenty of time to pick it up. This DVD is extensively chaptered so that you can skip the explanations and continue on directly to the drills once you are familiar with the breakdowns. 


Some combinations are designed to literally fit the music to help you work on your timing and musical interpretation, while other combinations will work almost anywhere. 


Each combination has it's own flavor, which is designed to increase your movement vocabulary and to expand your dance horizons! 


You can find all of our featured music on the Ya Bahaia CD. 


Dancers featured: Ahava - Aradia - Bahaia - Lotus Niraja - Princess Farhana - Ruby - Shoshanna - Summer Sahar - Zafira
