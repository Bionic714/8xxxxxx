,digimike50,2013-04-20T16:15Z,Very many thanks - you are a star!
,Abawcom,2013-04-20T16:20Z,Why the fuck would you upload quali and not the PRE or POST?? makes no sense.
,gbrecht,2013-04-20T17:07Z,Fairplay doesn't upload the full thing for some reason. Only race/quali no pre/post.
,IAMH67,2013-04-20T17:11Z,"@Abawcom

Reason 1) To complete the recording quicker.

Reason 2) To encode the torrent faster.

Reason 3) To upload torrent faster.

Reason 4) To seed smaller torrent faster. This torrent is 70% seeded but the show is still going on.

Reason 5) To not upload a huge torrent so late that no one needs it. The qualifying pre/post race show isn't as good or important as the race show which I always post.

Reason 6) Others will post the pre/post race torrent after me anyway so you can always download it from them instead of complaining on another torrent. That is something which clearly doesn't make sense to me.

I can keep on going all day but does that make enough sense for you?

,horsse,2013-04-20T17:20Z,"That's brilliant, thanks a bunch !"
,Mr.Power,2013-04-20T17:28Z,seed ffs how difficult can it be!!
,Abawcom,2013-04-20T18:02Z,"@IAMH67

The Pre show is a big part of my enjoyment of F1 especially on Sky. I prefer to watch the Pre Show before I watch quali. You not wanting to take to time and do the full job is on you. That being said I do want to thank you for taking the time to encode and upload anything at all the coverage in the states suck so I salute you sir."
,totocon,2013-04-20T18:16Z,"I have to say it again: THANK YOU!!!
Very good filesize, very good quality!
Would be awsome if you upload the race that fast!

Great job!"
,IAMH67,2013-04-20T18:45Z,I usually upload the show but while uploading torrents this fast thats not possible. I'll try to do so in the future.
,totocon,2013-04-20T18:59Z,"I just can talk for myself:
I like to watch it as fast as possible. I dont care that much about the pre and post show. "
,gianni4u,2013-04-20T19:40Z,"I hope that the race you will upload in the SD version, like you have done before.."
,Vader_1,2013-04-20T21:13Z,"Well i think its great, the Picture quality was excellent, I watch it on the TV but like to download and watch again! Thanks for your effort! You could probably do the race inn 2 parts as well haha, First hour then last 30 minutes just to upload it faster! "
,chem_101,2013-04-20T21:50Z,SEED FUCKERS!
,iluvjumpz,2013-04-20T21:50Z,no practice 3 available 
,SerSpec-V,2013-04-20T22:23Z,Thanks! P3 coming?
,bmcghie,2013-04-21T00:19Z,"Really good upload, and fast seeding. Thank you very much IAMH67 for your work!"
[V],spastik64,2013-04-21T02:51Z,"Stop complaining. Most releases are just the Qualifiying and it's ok. If you would be a TV capper + releaser you would understand.

Nice job!"
,blodgrapefrukt,2013-04-21T16:45Z,"Thank you very much IAMH67. Always glad to see your Formula 1 uploads, Unfortunately no pre- nor postshow this time. I like the whole circus... but good work nonetheless. 

Thanks again and looking forward for more.  
"
,Thanosb18c,2013-04-21T16:45Z,Thank you so much sir....Looking forward for your fast release of the race.....Here in the USA you are my only hope....Again Thank you so much for your efforts...
,blodgrapefrukt,2013-04-21T16:49Z,FUCK the haters! (no homo)
,blodgrapefrukt,2013-04-21T17:00Z,"I agree, pre- and postshow is not so important for qualification. Thanks again"
,nydownes,2013-04-23T19:28Z,"Yes... Pre and Post are not important (to some people).  And if you ask my girlfriend, she only likes the race and would say that qualifying is not even important!  And then there is my mom, she does not even watch F1 at all!

So... some ""fans"" like just the race, others just the qualifying and the race....  others watch all the practices and all the pre and post shows.

Whe know what kind of fan IAMH67 is, so lets find a seeder who is more of the fan we are.  If Anyone knows who that is I'd appreciate knowing.  

Last year there was an awesome guy out there that released all Practices, Quallies and Race... He made a separate file in the torrent for ""pre"" ""qualifying"" and ""post""... If you only wanted to watch the qually, you could just download the one file!"
,nydownes,2013-04-23T21:17Z,"Here is a version with Pre and Post Qualifying!!

Enjoy!"

What a stupid comment to make. You think me uploading part of the race gives you a reason to judge me as a fan? Trust me mate, I've been watching F1 before you were born. I watch the races Live on my TV and I only upload it to other Formula 1 fans so they can also enjoy the sport I love so much. Sometimes I can upload the entire shows and even post race forums as you can see from my torrents and other times I can only record or find race only. Your comment is perhaps the most stupidest assumption I've seen on TPB.

Also to stay on that point, watching the pre-race post race show doesn't make you an F1 fan. The Sky and BBC shows are sometimes dumbed down to explain the races to normal F1 fans. The hardcore fans don't need 30 minutes of Pirelli tyre interviews explaining to them what the tyres do every race, nor do they need to see to see Charles Pic and his team mate racing toy cars in their factory. It is just time filler which many fans I know who have been watching races for decades don't really care about. 

If you've seen F1 as long as some of us have you get sick of these shows. I don't mind them and watch them if I'm not busy with work mostly but honestly the only thing that matters to me is the race, not the glamor, grid girls or walking Bernie stroll up and down the grid shaking hands with hollywood stars. 

So congratulations on making one of the stupidest comment on TPB, I applaud you for that."
