,sonic360rocks,2013-04-20T14:37Z,thank you 
,BoneMonkey,2013-04-20T15:52Z,its says xgd3 but its xdg2 right?
,larryrube,2013-04-20T19:02Z,"I was confused about that too, BoneMonkey. It's only 7.3gb and the dvd file has the layer break at 1913760. So isn't that xgd2?"
,AoF,2013-04-20T19:15Z,If it was XGD3 it would have Topology Data but it doesn't so it has to be XGD2
,damasterozzy,2013-04-20T19:16Z,xgd2

that noob comment

Of course it's release group scene but is only uncompressed"
,toshi_b,2013-04-21T06:03Z,"if you're downloading a torrent, why would you want it rar'ed anyway ◘_◘"
,TrondSoapMacTavish,2013-04-21T12:05Z,The Game sux.... BIG TIME
,AoF,2013-04-21T15:56Z,"_Whoa_

I like how you're still commenting."
,killa7621,2013-04-21T16:14Z,Waiting on this to be verified in abgx before I play. Not taking any chances of being banned from xbl.
,killa7621,2013-04-21T16:24Z,Downloading at 1.5k/sec guys please seed. I will seed for a week when finished if you help me to download it in a reasonable time.
,misterburnz,2013-04-21T18:39Z,"Yes, please continue to be afraid of playing non-AAA titles on Live, 2 days prior to release. Not too mention an XGD2 title.  Yeah you're not getting banned, this isn't Bungies pride and joy, everyone can stop saying that. Had this game in less than an hour the second it dropped on OTE upload. Torrents are almost archaic now"
,killa7621,2013-04-21T19:00Z,When you get banned for doing something like playing a game before its release date that screams illegal copy you'll understand. The date of the save game files is enough reason for them to ban you if you get reported.
,Averad,2013-04-21T20:12Z,@misterburnz Why are you even posting here if you download from OTEu and find Torrents to be archaic? 
,AoF,2013-04-22T00:37Z,"Been playing online since yesterday 04-20-13. NOT BANNED.

This is not a major title such as GOW, Halo, Or Forza. You are safe to play this online."
,hardcorecouple69,2013-04-22T05:58Z,well i got banned a couple of years ago even tho i only played verified stealth patched games when they do a wave of bans i dont think it is just about stealth patching games and when i got banned i had been playing the xbox for about 2 years and all of a sudden banned.
,Theodd.bob,2013-04-22T21:18Z,Please seed. Got to 78% and not connected to any seeds. 
,vinnievic86,2013-04-23T03:01Z,Same as the last Dead Island... Next Gen consoles can't come fast enough! These games are all getting stale now. 
,Smallz94,2013-04-23T21:35Z,Still waiting for verification to play online with teammates than playing alone :))
,ONEmar,2013-04-24T01:24Z,"Works GREAT so far!
Thanks Gh0stNet!"
,Daky1001,2013-05-02T11:15Z,"Thx for the up,works great."
