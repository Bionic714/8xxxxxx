I could not find a copy of these songs anywhere, so I reverse engineered the javascript and flash players on their website (adoraband.com) and used wget to download the mp3s. All id3 tags are accurate and written by me. Due to the songs being extracted from a file hosting service the quality of many is quite low. All songs are mp3.
