Fantasy action film based on the Greek mythological warrior hero Theseus, who joins forces with the Gods to fight the Titans and save humankind. The power-hungry King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) has laid waste to Greece in his search for the legendary Epirus Bow, a weapon of limitless power that, in the wrong hands, could bring about the end of human life. Ancient law dictates that the Gods must not intervene in human conflict, and so they remain powerless to stop Hyperion and his merciless hordes - until young peasant Theseus (Henry Cavill), secretly chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans/John Hurt), steps forward to save the day.
