,AtraxS16,2013-04-20T22:08Z,"Legit, easy to apply and works like a charm.
Thnx!"
,chetowa85,2013-04-20T23:18Z,"I had a clean install in, then applied this and it won't work. I get up to the pop-up screen with the four playable charcters (before the actual logos) and then the typical ""Borderlands 2 has stopped working"". And yes I did move the cracks.

I'll uninstall, reinstall and then apply it again and post my results."
,chetowa85,2013-04-21T01:02Z,"Yup, still a no-go for me. I moved the crack, re-installed Skidrow's, and it worked fine. Installed yours, moved the crack, and nothing. Exact same error."
,chetowa85,2013-04-21T03:23Z,"The only DLC that appears is the Premiere Pack, and I don't even get the Mechromancer, just the keys, weapons and the relic. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,chetowa85,2013-04-21T03:47Z,Ignore everything I said it was a fucking directory error >.>

,vamkain,2013-04-23T01:35Z,"Thanks for the upload.

,kifkif92,2013-04-25T11:20Z,"Did anyone get this to work with windows 8 x64 ?

(P.s Windows 8 does not suck at all don't tell me to uninstall it)"
,rylgmr06,2013-04-26T20:30Z,The normal crack works on win8!
,Sylar1705,2013-04-29T01:39Z,Does this include Psycho Pack (the sixth playable character)?
,rylgmr06,2013-04-29T02:12Z,Krieg isn't even out!
,Sylar1705,2013-04-29T18:57Z,"Sorry, my bad. I thought it comes out with Ultimate Vault Hunter."
,strages,2013-05-02T03:14Z,Is this working with Windows 8 64bit? 
,rylgmr06,2013-05-03T03:32Z,"Yes, just use normal crack!"
,MerolaC2029,2013-05-04T18:46Z,Thanks guys!

,pilchernoah,2013-05-11T10:12Z,"I really need some assistance, I'm somewhat new to this and would appreciate the hell out of someone if they could provide more detailed instructions as to how to install this"
,TheWalkingHell,2013-05-13T19:24Z,what do you mean by includes not full game? some parts of the story mode are missing or something?
,Pishnx,2013-05-14T07:55Z,"@TheWalkingHell

It dosen't include the original game,this is just the dlc"
,TheWalkingHell,2013-05-14T21:03Z,"@Pishnx

I already knew that but thx anyways, i was wondering if some missions of the dlc's were missing.

(SPOILER: do not read if you havent beat sir hammerlocks dlc)

However, yesterday i was playing sir hammerlocks's dlc and when the ""god""claptrap give you the quests, his voice is missing. That bothers me a lot cause claptrap is my favorite character of the game. Anyone else with the same issue?"
,mehul3121996,2013-05-15T12:59Z,"Hey man, Norton deleted the Setup.exe in the update folder, do i have to download the entire torrent again? "
,mehul3121996,2013-05-15T13:04Z,"What, i cant see my comment anymore"
,mehul3121996,2013-05-15T15:57Z,"Okay, here is my problem.
Do i install the DlC and update in ""Program files/2K games/Borderlands 2""
Or
""Program files/2k games""?
"
,archee711,2013-05-15T22:48Z,What original game release would you guys recommend for this?
,Desric,2013-05-17T21:04Z,"Maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong here..... I have uninstalled/reinstalled the game 3 times now and everytime I go to apply the update it keeps giving me an error for corrupted files when I get towards the end. I ignored the first couple but its happening for every file after about 75%.  This is the only torrent that I've had this happen to. 

Currently I deleted the file and have started to re-d/l it hoping that maybe it was something in my orginal download. 

Any help or insight would be appreciated, thanks guys"
,wrecktem,2013-06-01T02:33Z,Not a single one of your torrents actually works.
,rylgmr06,2013-06-03T22:14Z,"use ""borderlands2.exe"" to run the game. Not the launcher.
My Torrents do work! I test them all! Maybe you didn't do it right..."
