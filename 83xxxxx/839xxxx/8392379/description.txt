"Apollo Run writes mountain-conquering songs.  They're not trying to earn a wink from some gal, they're taking over the world, so it helps that their big-hearted myth rock is crafted by three dudes who don't mind getting sweaty out there.  In fact, for the release of their debut LP, Here Be Dragons Vol. III, John, Jeff and Graham trained hard on fundamentals.  That's right, nuts and bolts, bread and butter."
