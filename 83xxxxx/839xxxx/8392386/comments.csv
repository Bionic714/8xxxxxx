A). Spend this time with the wife? 

B). Spend some time with my kids? 

C). Re-encode a test cap many times until I had made the video quality better, the file size smaller, & the time required to prepair/upload much quicker!?


Enjoy..."

Excellent rip. This shows that your source is good or your recording is good. Its just that you were doing a bad job previously.

This SD release is excellent. I have nothing to complain about on the quality at this size!.

Though, improve on cropping. The video isn't 16:9 and right side needs to be cropped.

Thanks for this, BTW."
,IW11,2013-04-20T21:26Z,"Thanks for this upload.

2 Quick questions:
1) Any chance to split the files up buildup/event?
2) Do you know why I am unable to get an RSS feed link for your uploads here on TPB? Other users I can, but yours does not show up.

Thanks and cheers!"
,rediffpiratebay4ever,2013-04-20T22:28Z,its super weird that you dont remove the ads any reason for that
,Viciously,2013-04-20T23:01Z,"^

... well give him some time, maybe he will start doing it. It takes a lot of time editing out the ads using the traditional method plus you have to either remember the timestamps when the ads show up, manually look for them or write them down on a piece of paper while watching the live tele!.

@smc

Get MKVToolNIX.

1: You can split the file according to your needs. Make it into 10 parts for all you care. :p

2: You can edit out ads with this 'nontraditional' way by splitting the file as soon as the ad starts and then doing that until you've killed all the ads and then merge all the files together... and we have the complete file!. You can do it before encoding or after encoding. Doesn't matter.

Thou be warned that output files will have the .mkv extension but you can edit their extension to be .mp4.

If you need any help, ask."
,smcgill1969,2013-04-20T23:05Z,"@rediffpiratebay4ever - Editing out adverts is a super pain in the arse when preparing the file over a VNC link from remote... Besides, for all I know you may want to buy a $50,000 Rolex! ;)"
,downforze,2013-04-21T14:05Z,thank you smcgill1969 and no enjoy time with family and kids. I try the same :)
