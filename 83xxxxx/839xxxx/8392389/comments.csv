,wsimon98,2013-04-28T05:02Z,"NO FUCKIN WAY! SWEET!!! BUH BYE WEAK ASS WALKING DEAD! If this show hangs in there, all the walking dead audience will give up on their drama filled pile of shit."
,mwalsher,2013-05-06T20:16Z,"@wsimon98, I know what you mean. The Walking Dead started out amusing but turned into a boring soap-opera where every episode is just people sitting around staring dramatically off into the distance with the occasional bit of lame, ass-hattery murdering each other. BORING!"
,SBonesE8,2013-05-07T14:24Z,"your dumb the walking dead has real emotional stuff an follows a logical path.nothing soap opera.an y u people hating this show? itt was hilarious,the scene with old folks or the first scene with guy talking about his sandwich not havin a pickle while apocalypse happening in the window behind was gold"
,dimoha16,2013-05-09T07:13Z,So was this show canceled? Bc of bad ratings?
,morepunkthanu,2013-05-13T01:26Z,"why cant i delete this? it says its running in windows explorer?

the show sucks ass anyhow"
,hotnutz,2013-05-18T19:56Z,awesome show.when does episode 2 air
,mwalsher,2013-05-25T15:30Z,"@SBonesE8, the emotional stuff is exactly what makes Walking Dead a soap opera."
