,tofumunch,2013-04-21T17:17Z,"seemed like they were on a low budget. i don't know, it just felt very ""light"". people who had a surprisingly good experience with 'house of cards' will be disappointed. supposedly funny moments felt very forced and random. the acting was just ok. fans of zombie stuff might go along with it but in my opinion, not worth it.

WTF!!!! who are u to judge this EPIC movie u ......
i didnt watched yet but i know its good becouse of original movie so STFU"
,Primuz017,2013-04-26T18:16Z,"@mire9000 -  I was actually being kind when giving it a 2 out of 10, it really does not even deserve a 0. It looks even worse than the worst homemade film lol.

You mean the original movie with Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Emma Stone etc?  Yes that one was awesome I agree. But this? No man, just watch it and see for yourself, 0/10."

,Coffeeman2cups,2013-05-20T00:13Z,funny as hell big 10 :-)
