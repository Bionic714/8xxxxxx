,SirScoops,2013-05-09T02:50Z,the installer is so shitty... it crashed twice and when it finally worked it wont even run.. its all in spanish because victorval is apparently gay... and it basically downloaded at 70kb/s for 24 hours
,Ind0,2013-05-11T16:59Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD

Worst custom installer ever, see post above. 

Victorval is a retard. And nobody gives a fuck you're spanish, this is the internet, so WRITE SHIT IN ENGLISH."
