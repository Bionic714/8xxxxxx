,bronyfag,2013-04-20T17:19Z,Is this because of 4craft?
,Sparaml,2013-04-23T13:39Z,"I didn't mentioned it was a .jar file, so it works on any OS. btw, thank you for seeding!"
,bigboobs666,2013-04-23T14:37Z,Thank you. Good work!!! Launching working nice on linux.
,NULUSIOS,2013-04-23T23:06Z,"Sparamoule can you update for launcher 0.3?
Also (PLEEEEASE) can you make it that we can set destination directory for the whole ""minecraft"" folder?
I tried to change variable USERPROFILE and CSIDL_PROFILE (which you should use to find user profile), but launcher still goes to my profile folder.
I want to use a specific folder."
,Sparaml,2013-04-24T13:06Z,Working on that.
,NULUSIOS,2013-04-24T14:19Z,Great. Note that 13w16b is out.
,NULUSIOS,2013-04-24T14:19Z,...and 0.4 launcher.
,Sparaml,2013-04-24T16:05Z,"fyi, 13w16a, 13w16b and any future version are (or will be) recognized and downloaded with this launcher. But don't worry, I am working on the new 0.4 launcher."
,NULUSIOS,2013-04-24T18:34Z,"Please don't forget to help with the install directory. Many people don't want to go to user profile.
If you cannot implement this in the launcher, give some instruction to do it externally (like setting an environment variable).
Thanks."
,Sparaml,2013-04-25T15:38Z,"1.5.1 doesn't work with this launcher, use the anjocaido's one instead."
,NULUSIOS,2013-04-25T20:00Z,"I know. This is not what I ask.
I ask for a method that the game is not downloaded and stored in user home directory.
I want to store it in a specific path."
,Sparaml,2013-04-26T02:22Z,"I know this is not what you ask, it was just an indication about versions added in the launcher. I am currently working on the 0.5 launcher, but I am having big thread issues, so it will take longer to release than expected."
