And here is 24 season 3, as requested. Make sure you use a player which is capable of playing 10bit material, for example VLC.
No borders were cropped this time, but some denoising was done once again.
Unfortunately the noise was pretty heavy and complex sometimes and I did not want to tweak the parameters for each episode individually.
So you might still notice some artifacts, but definitely better than the original DVD.
