Presented here are all four chapters of Mill's essay written in 1861, which address the legal subordination of women as manifested in their exclusion from the political process and their lack of any rights within marriage. Principally considered is the relation of the sexes within the family structure as a paradigm of, and the seedbed for, the general social and political structure that surrounds it. Edited by Sue Mansfield, this carefully annotated volume also contains an introduction, a list of principal dates in the life of John Stuart Mill, and a bibliography.
