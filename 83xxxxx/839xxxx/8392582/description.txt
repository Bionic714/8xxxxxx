The VHS was mint, unwrapped yesterday, but the intro contains a very small amount of static, and a very slight and short encoding glitch, that all stops before the concert starts. Captured with an Asus MyCinema card, using MAGIX Movie Edit Pro, then authored to DVD9 using VideoReDo TVSuite V4, without re-encoding, resulting in quality video and sound. Tested on a Philips DVD player, works, and will benefit from a wide-screen as well. You're very welcome, enjoy, and please share.

The Statue Of Liberty was shipped from France to America, in about fifty pieces, states Maestro Mercurio. Mercurial Overture was at the time, Steven's most recent work, that was written for, and premièred at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, 1999; it is performed after song 12: Ungrateful Heart.
