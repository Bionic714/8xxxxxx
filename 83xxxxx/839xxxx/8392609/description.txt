Dale Spitler is a mild-mannered, slightly nerdy high school student who sometimes works as a babysitter for Darlene Murphy, a single mother raising an annoying but cute eight-year-old daughter, Dustine. Darlene makes it very clear to Dale that she has the hots for him, but Dale is gay, and only has eyes for Raymond Haver, the hunky but thick-headed (and extremely heterosexual) captain of the wrestling team. One day, while Dale is looking after Dustine (and trying to find Darlene's stash of Playgirl magazines), his best friend Violet Wertsema arrives in a panic -- it seems she was involved in an accident with a pickup truck, which led to the truck bursting into flames. Dale and Violet arrive at the scene of the accident, where Dale discovers that the driver of the ruined truck was none other than Raymond. Raymond has not survived the wreck, but Dale wonders if this might provide the opportunity for a romantic encounter with Raymond that never could have occurred while the wrestler was alive...
