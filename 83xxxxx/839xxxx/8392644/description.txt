Overview:

∟Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines Members of the public, you have ONE minute to reach minimum safe distance!↔

Take the wheel as Max Damage as you plow scores of vehicles unlucky enough to be in your way. Your soundtrack will be the sound of crunching metal, the splatter of motor oil on the windshield, and the screams of skidding tires. With a white-knuckled grip on the wheel, you↓ll have the choice of 23 crashmobiles (from a terrifying monster truck to a high octane Dragster) and 30+ levels of hellish fury and motorized terror.

Carmageddon was surrounded by huge controversy. A game about mowing down innocent race cars and getting points for it was not exactly something the world was prepared for back when it released. However, all this noise just made everyone talk about this title even more and it's evident that behind all this fuss there is actually an extremely fun game with very unique and crazy gameplay. Now you can experience it for yourself in its full, original, glory.
