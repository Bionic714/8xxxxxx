I can see that you're using the blocksize 8 MB in some of your uploads.  

Thats a tough size .... !

===================

If you lower the blocksize down to 2 MB ( 2048 KB ), or maybe better 1 MB ( 1024 KB ), 
you probably should gain a lot of time in upload time  / download time .... !

( I'm talking about the so called ""Piece size"" when you create the new Torrent )

This will have an impact, specially for downloaders with slower download-speed.

===================

.... also .... Sooner or later, the moderators will find out what you're doing here at TPB,
and then there's a risk that they'll change the color of your skull ....

/ You're doing a great job !"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-20T18:55Z,@Agentbay I'm enjoying uploading for all of you here.  I just want to upload good quality torrents. How do you lower your blocksize?

===================================
( If you're using uTorrent ) :

When creating the Torrent

01) Go up on the left side and click on ""file""
02) Then click on ""Create New Torrent""
03) Then you have on the lower part ""piece size""

( 1024 KB or maybe 2048 KB are good choices )
====================================

/ I wish i had your ""Library"" around the corner ( LOL) ...."
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-20T22:25Z,@Agentbay Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll do that for all my torrents. I'm still learning here. I hope that I get a skull soon.
