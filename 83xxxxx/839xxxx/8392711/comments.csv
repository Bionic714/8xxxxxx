Sidenote: I was wondering if you could recommend and programs for just taking out the 2 channel track so I'm only left with the 5.1 track? would it be worth it size wise? I stream all my media from plex so compatibility is a non issue for video playback."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-04-25T18:20Z,"Naw it's not worth doing imo, to strip 45-65MB (this movie is 54.9MB for the 2 channel stereo audio) off the total size of the file by going through all that work?

Well it's up to you, and sorry no i don't have any recommendations for what program would be best to do that.

Glad you're enjoying it!"
