Where thereΓÇÖs smoke, thereΓÇÖs fire...

Since 9/11, Brooklyn firefighter Griff Muir has wrestled with impossible feelings for his best friend and partner at Ladder 181, Dante Anastagio. Unfortunately, Dante is strictly a ladiesΓÇÖ man, and the FDNY isnΓÇÖt exactly gay-friendly. For ten years, Griff has hidden his heart in a half-life of public heroics and private anguish.

GriffΓÇÖs caution and DanteΓÇÖs cockiness make them an unbeatable team. To protect his buddy, thereΓÇÖs nothing Griff wouldnΓÇÖt doΓÇª until a nearly bankrupt Dante proposes the worst possible solution: HotHead.com, a gay porn website where uniformed hunks get down and dirty. And Dante wants them to appear thereΓÇötogether. Griff may have to guard his heart and live out his darkest fantasies on camera. Can he rescue the man he loves without wrecking their careers, their families, or their friendship?
