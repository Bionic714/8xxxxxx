,crisj73,2013-04-23T03:00Z,"Ok, i'm getting the impression this is not the real deal as the album is not released until April 23 in the States. Not sure about UK or rest of the world. There are 4 trackers showing 0 downloaded."
,EmP4,2013-04-23T19:00Z,It's definitely fake.
,EmP4,2013-04-23T19:01Z,The album is so bad people don't even want to pirate it.  Hysterical.
