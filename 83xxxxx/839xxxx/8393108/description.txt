"Recorded in Buenos Aires with an excellent band of South American musicians, Chapter One: Latin America burns with exotic rhythms and passionate playing. Chapter Two recorded in Los Angeles with roughly the same musicians, is not quite as successful, but Barbieri's collaboration with the brilliant arranger Chico O'Farrill, Chapter Three, is a remarkable set of orchestrated Latim American songs. The Chapter Four Bottom Line recording is notable just for Barbieri's interplay with Howard Johnson's tuba."
