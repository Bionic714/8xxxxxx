"From Mysterious Traveller forward there is a much keener awareness of studio technique, and a growing sense of how to integrate the various Electronic keyboards on Zawinul's part; Vitous is replaced by the funkier electric bass of Alphonso Johnson and a string of players fill the percussion chairs. Mysterious Traveller is the most successful album of this period, but excellent improvisations like "Cucumber Slumber" and "Blackthorn Rose" notwithstanding, there is energy missing in all of these works due to the contained percussion work and the overall technological veneer of the music." *****

"Not bad, not bad--but is that all there is? Maybe what makes the traveller so mysterious is that he doesn't go anywhere in particular. Not even with Alphonso Johnson pushing like hell from underneath." B
