PLEASE SUPPORT THIS AMAZING ARTIST AND ARTISTS!
If you think something should be added, know better quality tracks, suggestions, and questions post in the comments.
Let me know if I messed something up like spelling or a track not trimmed right etc. I have not even listened to all of these yet :(. I put in about $40 and 15 hours maybe more into this so please enjoy.
I will try to keep this up to date and will reupload when Final Fantasy Medley comes out.
All the tracks that were on iTunes were purchased then converted to 320kbps mp3.
A few are from other torrents on The Pirate Bay or downloaded off of YouTube (The tubes :D).
Lindsey Stirling is under contributing artist on all songs in the tags, excluding Stomp on Melvin and the Christmas songs, so it is easier to play on devices. The tracks are in folders based on who else is on the track.
Feel free to distribute this everywhere!
