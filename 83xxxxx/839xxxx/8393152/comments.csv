Can anyone confirm this? I tried searching to see if it will be released anywhere on April 29th but can't find anything on it. "
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-21T09:39Z,"This CAM is total unwatchable CRAP ! 

The douchbag that recorded this held the fucking camera in his hand for the whole movie ! What a fucking idiot. The camera shakes and moves around through the whole fucking movie !  The camera needs to be stationary, not moving around the whole fucking time. Whoever recorded this doesn't know a fucking thing about filming. 

The picture is all washed out and the audio crackles. 

Not worth getting.

,jammerking,2013-04-22T00:18Z,"Thank you for the upload. Missing the opening credits+  camera movements. Tin can sound  fast motion blurry.  Obviously some will find this watchable and others like myself will not. 

Don't waste your time this is just a much larger version of the 42 2013 CAM XviD Feel-Free 728.28 MiB one. Missing starting credits actually over 6 minutes at the start and the rest at the end.

imdb shows 128 min this one 117 min 
Cam rating 
A 5 tinny  V5 

DVDrip rating A2 V2"
