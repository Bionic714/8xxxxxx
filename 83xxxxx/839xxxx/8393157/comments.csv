,SgtGoldy,2013-04-21T08:24Z,"@psycomem I have a progressive idea... google it. But since its a cracked version I can bet co-op & online are out of the question. Maybe LAN if it has it, but thats it. Single player is going to be the main focus of any cracked game, with Hamachi/Tunngle being a possibility."
