Impotent piano player (and part time magician) Monsieur Matthieu (Richard Lemieuvre) arranges several sexual escapades for his young and beautiful wife Clarisse (Brigitte Lahaie), whether she likes it or not. For instance, she has to bring a letter from her husband to M. Morange in a hotel room. You can tell this is going to be trouble when Morange turns out to be Dominique Aveline, who seems to play some kind of sleaze ball in every film Brigitte Lahaie ever made. His and her resume's must overlap a lot. The letter instruct Morange to have sex with Clarisse (well, what did you expect) and when she objects, his hotel maid makes sure she complies. At night, Matthieu wants her to tell everything that happened in great detail in front of his schoolgirl pupil and her mother, but she refuses and leaves the dinner table. Later she does returns to the sitting room to eat cake while he plays the piano. Before long the two guest (Cristel Lauris as the mother and Catherine Ringer as Emille) start to loosen their clothes and soon all three women are pleasuring themselves on the couch, while the music plays on and the servants are no longer able to contain themselves.
