,manzel,2013-04-20T21:06Z,Many thanks! Always good to get these before they are broadcast in my country.
,Benishdamenish,2013-04-20T23:28Z,"Gratitude eztv,

Just started getting into this series and I have to say it's damn good. Definitely one of the most underestimated/overlooked sci-fi shows EVER!"
,TheFireMonkey,2013-04-20T23:52Z,"Can anyone explain why, with 4783 seeders currently, I have been waiting about 45 minutes and still have 0 bytes downloaded? This seems to be getting ever more common these days, I never used to have a problem but more and more I find torrent here that say they have lots of seeders and leechers and yet the sit for ages, often more than 90 minutes, before they start to download. As I have no problem getting some torrents [currently I have one downloadingt from another site which started up find and is averagingt about 200 kB/s] and I have lots of bandwidth [when I'm downloading a bunch of files I often hit a speed of 1.5 GB/s] I am baffled by the problem and looking for any suggestions.

I use uTorrent and have done so for years without problems - this is something new that started happening occationally maybe a month or two ago and now seems to be happening with more than half my downloads."
,cmilkes,2013-04-21T00:04Z,"@ manzel
are you kidding? doctor who is the biggest sci-fi show on TV. its got higher critical ratings and more of a viewership than pretty much all other sci-fi shows on the air right now, not to mention is one of the longest running. I think it is in no way overlooked/underrated. Its got a cult following lol"

,ZombieTurtlePro,2013-04-21T03:36Z,I know it's a bit childish but I scare easily and this episode is probably the scariest released in a long while.

,MyKrossini,2013-04-21T04:38Z,"@Benishdamenish - Doctor Who is not underestimated or overlooked in any way. In fact, it is one of the most successful science fiction shows in history. It first aired in 1963 and is presently being broadcast in 48 countries each week with fans in many, many more. Just because you overlooked it for so many years does not mean everyone else did. Welcome to the wonderful world of Doctor Who.
Thank you EZ for another great upload! A/V 10/10"
,nawzman,2013-04-21T07:12Z,"Good episode, but really hate having the end credits clipped. I don't care if there's a announcer talking over a few seconds, I want to hear the end music (since it's slightly different) and be able to see who played who, etc. It makes me feel like its totally incomplete."

Great copy, thanks!"
,TheFireMonkey,2013-04-21T09:05Z,Thanks Gryph_on
,Austypausty,2013-04-22T10:42Z,"@TheFireMonkey, sometimes I have the same problem where the torrent won't start downloading. What I find is that if you remove it then add it again it starts immediately so maybe try that too."
,Doom69,2013-04-22T15:01Z,"Thank you, been watching it since it started, back on the 23 November 1963."
,miamisunset,2013-04-23T14:44Z,This is actually Episode 10. Everyone is making the same mistake but it is the 10th episode aired this season.
,DrTen,2013-04-26T23:42Z,"@miamisunset: Christmas specials don't count in the episode numbering for Doctor Who. It's just the first time we've had the special in the middle of a season, making naming awkward if you want to keep them in order."
,Montereyjack-1,2013-04-28T07:32Z,"No he's right, it is the tenth episode, Xmas episode would make it 11"
,Montereyjack-1,2013-04-28T08:12Z,"oops, nevermind, wrong torrent, yes, this is the 9th one"
