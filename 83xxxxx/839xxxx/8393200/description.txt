"The Hook, being the Hook, almost never makes a bad album, but he does tend to be a little too boogieing even. This one breaks the pattern, with an agonizing version of "TB Sheets," an apt contribution from Van Morrison, and great studio work from guitarist Luther Tucker, Mel Brown, and Elvin Bishop." A-
