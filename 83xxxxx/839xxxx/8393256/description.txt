2013 album from the Swedish Metal quartet. Many bands play it safe. Hardcore Superstar do not. They had the guts to marry two styles that grew up hating each other - Thrash Metal and Sleaze Rock. The former hard, aggressive and ugly, the latter catchy, melodic and decadent. The bastard child s name? Street metal! C mon Take On Me is produced by the band and mixed by no less a figure than Randy Staub (Metallica, Mötley Crüe, The Cult), slapping you in the face like a highly-energized slab of Crüe and Poison.
