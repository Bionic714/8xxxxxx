2013 debut album from the Swedish rockers featuring guitarist Mattias Bärjed (Soundtrack Of Our Lives) and drummer Ludwig Dahlberg (The International Noise Conspiracy). The band plays a personally composed ‘Freedom Rock’ that swings hard with an energetic, authoritarian and uncompromising sound. (amazon.com)

Free Fall seem to have made the perfect start with this album. The four-piece, one-guitar lineup is the ultimate epitome of a classic heavy rock band, and with this exact type of lineup, Free Fall do things in the right earnest. For fans of classic hard rock, Free Fall’s ‘Power & Volume’ is an absolute must. A fantastic debut without a doubt!
