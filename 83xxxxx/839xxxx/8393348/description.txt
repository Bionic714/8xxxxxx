Description:
Discover your evil side as you build your own underground kingdom. Carve out a living, breathing world and attract a host of devilish creatures to swell the ranks of your dark hoards. Form an alliance with the Horned Reaper and expand your empire in your quest to reach the daylight and invade the realms above.

Dungeon Keeper 2 is everything its predecessor was, only better and badder! It is probably one of the most addictive and fun games ever created; with tons of dark humor, smooth gameplay, and high replayability value. In addition to that there is a well designed multiplayer mode and a pet-dungeon module that tests your ability to build the ultimate underground labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and other hellish devices. If you liked Dungeon Keeper you will love this ultimate installment of the series.
