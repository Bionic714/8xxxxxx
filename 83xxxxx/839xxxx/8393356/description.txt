Duke Nukem
Every great hero has a humble beginning. Go back to the very roots of the King of Badassery, Duke Nukem. YouΓÇÖve been called on a top secret mission to save the world from the brilliantly evil Dr. Proton and his Techbot army! Originally conceived as three seperate episodes, Duke Nukem will take you all the way through a demolished city, a secret moonbase, and, finally, the very future of Earth itself! Are you man enough to step into the butt-kicking boots of Duke Nukem?

Duke Nukem 2
After a triumphant return from the previous assignment, our main man Duke decides to write a book (ΓÇ£Why IΓÇÖm So Great" in his spare time and take some well-deserved time off. Our heroΓÇÖs rest and book tour was not meant to last for too long, though. He got snatched by alien invaders right in the middle of a TV interview! The plan was as simple as it was devious: turn Duke into a zombie using the Encephalosucker and take over the world! Get out of the alien-infested jail and kick those slimy alien butts back to whence they came!
