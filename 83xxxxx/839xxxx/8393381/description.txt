Godard thought so highly of Les godelureaux that he not only put it on his Top 10 list for 1961 but even named it one of the six best French films since the Liberation (along with films by Oph√ºls, Renoir, Bresson, Cocteau, and Rouch). Rohmer liked the film, too: in his 1961 essay "The Taste for Beauty," he compared Les godelureaux favorably with Shadows and cited it as a modern film proving that the cinema is the equal of the older, established arts. Though Chabrol himself thought Les godelureaux "futile," it has a self-contradicting vitality that it shares with no other film; darkly funny, poignant, and disturbing, this rarely seen work seems to draw an end to an era (the mythical period of the beginning of the French New Wave, glorying in possibility) and herald a new age of uncertainties and compromises.
