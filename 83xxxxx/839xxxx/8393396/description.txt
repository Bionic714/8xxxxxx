Crossroads and Cultures, Combined Volume: A History of the World's Peoples-2010kaiser
==================================================================================



Crossroads and Cultures: A History of the World's Peoples incorporates the best current cultural history into a fresh and original narrative that connects global patterns of development with life on the ground. As the title, "Crossroads," suggests, this new synthesis highlights the places and times where people exchanged goods and commodities, shared innovations and ideas, waged war and spread disease, and in doing so joined their lives to the broad sweep of global history . Students benefit from a strong pedagogical design, abundant maps and images, and special features that heighten the narrative's attention to the lives and voices of the world's peoples.
