       Image for Windows is an affordable and reliable drive image backup 
       and restore solution that provides an easy and convenient way to 
       completely backup all your hard drive's data, programs and 
       operating systems. Your backups can be saved directly to external 
       USB and FireWireÖ drives, to internal or network drives, and even 
       directly to CD, DVD, or BD. The Image for Windows package includes 
       an easy-to-use MakeDisk wizard for creating a recovery boot disk. 
       To restore your data, programs and operating systems back to the 
       way they were when the backup was created, simply boot the 
       recovery disk and restore the partition(s) or drive(s) you need to 
                            recover. It's that easy.

       Image for Windows utilizes the technology provided by Volume 
       Shadow Copy Service (VSS) or PHYLockÖ, an add-on component 
       included in the Image for Windows package. VSS and PHYLockÖ allows 
       you to continue using your computer while the backup is locked to 
       a point-in-time. This eliminates the inconsistencies typically 
          experienced while backing up a partition that is in use.

       Image for Windows runs under the Windows operating system, yet it 
       can backup or restore any partition, including those of DOS or 
       Linux, and even partitions encrypted by third-party software.
