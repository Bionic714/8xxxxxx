But first you should check, and then leave a message.
In the folder you have proof.

,Coercion,2013-04-27T04:21Z,"Excuse me for my perhaps indiscreet response, but I'm a bit dubious about the comprised song; the source of it? I've searched throughout the internet and found nothing relevant. Don't take it as irreverence, this release is laudable, but my concern lies in the source. If you could be generous enough to expatiate how you obtained it, it would be much appreciated. Thanks for the upload, I rejoice my friend :)."

I'm sorry but again I can tell everything is in the folder.

For some things, google is not a magical wand.

I say, every comment appreciate and respect, if not offensive.

Any specific encoding on original FLAC file?"
,Coercion,2013-05-04T20:28Z,"@ Maximum38
I have tried porting 24 bit - 96hz onto my Ipod as well. Presumably, it will perhaps only will be susceptible to 48hz, maybe higher but less than 88hz, but 24 bit depth is construed as acceptable. I'm not sure about this phenomenon; considering this particular FLAC file is 24 bit - 88hz. You can reconsider converting it to sundry ALAC files at various Hz and which will be adequate. Hope this helped. :)"
[V],baby967,2013-05-04T21:36Z,"Thank you Coercion
