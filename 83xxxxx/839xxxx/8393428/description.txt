Wikipedia:
Fairport Convention is Fairport Convention's debut album. The band formed in 1967, with original line-up Judy Dyble and Ian MacDonald (later known as Iain Matthews) (vocals), Richard Thompson and Simon Nicol (guitars), Ashley ΓÇ£TygerΓÇ¥ Hutchings (bass) and Sean Frater, replaced after their first gig by Martin Lamble (percussion). In this form they made their major London stage debut in one of Brian EpsteinΓÇÖs Sunday concerts at the Saville Theatre.
With a rock approach strongly influenced by Jefferson Airplane's first two albums (as opposed to the traditional English folk fusion they later became famous for), the debut album features covers of songs by Emitt Rhodes, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Jim & Jean, and an adaptation of a poem by George Painter, as well as original material.
This is the only Fairport Convention studio album to feature Judy Dyble. She was replaced in 1968 by Sandy Denny, but during her short time with the band she managed to make a noticeable impression, particularly through her on-stage habit of knitting dishcloths and scarves when not actually singing.[3]
The album should not be confused with the A&M Records' "Fairport Convention", the USA release/re-titling of their second UK album, What We Did On Our Holidays. The first album, listed a product of Polydor-England, was finally released in the U.S. on Cotillion Records in 1970.
