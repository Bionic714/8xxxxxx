Encoded the entire series of Death Note into high quality MKV h.264 format with both English and Japanese audio, and English Subtitles as well.

Finding this series was somewhat easy and in decent quality even though their could be better. While there were decent quality versions out there, most had issues like no English subtitles, subtitles that were messed up or had misspellings, a messed up episode 27, or they simply could use better quality video. Dual Audio is a bit harder to find and after all the trouble I went through with these subtitles and getting them right, I think I can understand why.

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
