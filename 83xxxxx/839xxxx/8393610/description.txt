R.E.M - Live in Greensboro - 2013 [EP] FLAC
===========================================

In anticipation of the R.E.M. Green 25th Anniversary Edition coming May 14th,
Rhino will release a limited edition, five-track EP as part of Record Store Day.

This exclusive CD features a handful of performances from the November 10th,
1989 show in Greensboro, North Carolina, that, due to space constraints, are not
found on the Deluxe Edition, including the Green track I Remember California and
classics like So. Central Rain and Feeling Gravitys Pull.

Limited to just 2,500 copies, the disc comes with an original (non-reproduction)
patch from the Green Tour. These patches were recently uncovered in the band's vault.
