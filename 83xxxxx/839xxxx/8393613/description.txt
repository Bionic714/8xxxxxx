Ep 7: Dita, Jody and Gaultier
 
Cameron pays a visit to Dita Von TeeseΓÇÖs closet, which is more of a tease than anything else. Then, Decades hits the road when Cameron, Christos, and the rest of the crew head to San Francisco for a ΓÇ£pop-upΓÇ¥ store event featuring their vintage collection of designer Jean Paul Gaultier. A surprise visit from an old friend, singing superstar Jody Watley, leads Christos to strike a pose.
