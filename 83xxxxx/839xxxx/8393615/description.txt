Ep 7: Dubai Bye

PREMIERE: Wednesday April 17, 10:30 pm
 
Brad and Lindsay travel across the globe to Dubai to help launch the Kate Spade New York brand in the Middle East. Brad struggles with social norms and different fashion tastes as he works in a country that frowns on high hemlines and low necklines, and he worries how the collection will translate. As he styles influencers, socialites and models for the big launch party, Brad struggles with overcoming cultural differences, missing models and broken accessories. A post-party camel ride reveals a surprising side of Brad.
