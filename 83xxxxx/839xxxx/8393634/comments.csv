,Arazbr,2013-04-21T07:29Z,THANKKSSSSSSSSSSSS!
,thankyou2,2013-04-21T09:51Z,You're Welcome. I have used and benefited from TTC courses from here and I decided I would try to give back. 
,w55,2013-04-22T01:21Z,"Great!  I've been dying for this series since I saw it pop on thegreatcourses.com.  I see each lecture is broken up into 6 parts, so once I have the whole series I will merge each of the 6 parts into a single lecture, rename, and then repost the whole series.  So if you want to wait then feel free...I will have it all fixed up and posted in a day or two depending on the seeding."
,thankyou2,2013-04-22T02:27Z,I got it from the library on cd and ripped it to mp3. Those are the tracks on the original cd's. 
,w55,2013-04-22T12:05Z,"Yeah, I figured that was the way they were labeled on the disk.  I just hope I get a chance to make the lectures a little bit better for mp3 players in the end...that is if it gets fully seeded as it seems stuck on 39.2 at the moment.  Thank you thankyou2!"
