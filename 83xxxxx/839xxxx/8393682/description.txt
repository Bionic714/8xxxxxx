Guide to Essential Math, Second Edition: A Review for Physics, Chemistry and Engineering Students - 2010kaiser
===================================================================================



This book reminds students in junior, senior and graduate level courses in physics, chemistry and engineering of the math they may have forgotten (or learned imperfectly), which is needed to succeed in science courses. The focus is on math actually used in physics, chemistry and engineering, and the approach to mathematics begins with 12 examples of increasing complexity, designed to hone the student's ability to think in mathematical terms and to apply quantitative methods to scientific problems. Detailed Illustrations and links to reference material online help further comprehension. The second edition features new problems, illustrations, and features expanded chapters on matrix algebra and differential equations.

- Use of proven pedagogical techniques developed during the author's 40 years of teaching experience.
- New practice problems and exercises to enhance comprehension.
- Coverage of fairly advanced topics, including vector and matrix algebra, partial differential equations, special functions and complex variables.
