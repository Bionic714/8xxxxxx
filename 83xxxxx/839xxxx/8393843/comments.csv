Sorry for the inconvenience."
,architeuthis666,2013-05-13T19:30Z,"The ""eotan"" thing is a subject of great debate. It is a very interesting translation because it is an Old English word for giants/titans (modern equivalent is ""ettin""), is proto-Germanic in origin (fits well with the German theme of the show), and eotans/ettins were specifically people eaters (of the non-one-eyed-one-horned-flying-purple variety). On the other hand, it's a lot to swallow when a lowly subtitler stamps their own mark on a show so strongly. Many are of the opinion subbers should strive to add as little of their own personality as possible to a show. Commie definitely brings some of their own flavor. Caveat emptor."
