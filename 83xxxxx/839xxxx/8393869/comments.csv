[V],psspss,2013-04-21T02:29Z,"if you dont want xvids the mp4s and mkvs 720p are available as well

mine are done my way to ensure correct header for tvs and of course I spend soem time adding titles and dates to the files"
,beechyboy,2013-04-21T14:51Z,"You say "" mine are done my way to ensure correct header for tvs ""  Is this for old TV's?
What does that mean? I have a LG TV with a built-in media player. It doesn't need what you call ""Optimized for ___ TV"" It plays anything (MP4 AVI Etc)"
[V],psspss,2013-04-21T16:00Z,"different brands of smarttvs are more fussy what junk is in the header.. like the line saying the encoder used can throw them and give bad format even though the encoding is valid for the tv

open format throws them also.. called opml which avidemux 2.6 encoder uses that container the new format

and some other things too.

also depends if you stream it over wifi to tv rather then direct.. direct on usb is less fussy then streaming via DLNA"
[V],psspss,2013-04-21T16:04Z,"xvid avi is treated different then mp4s.. however i only do xvids im not sure what headers for mp4 or encodings can throw various tvs but you can always install free serviio media server on laptop and transcode on the fly any format anyhow.. so it plays regardless of tvs as long as you use a profile that forces transcoding of all formats.. I find choosing panasonic veira profiles works on all smart tvs so far..

well enough tech tech back to watching of of the converts ive down.. time to relax and then bed"
[V],psspss,2013-04-22T08:51Z,see toy hunter S02E03 i added a header repair and fixer tool link there.. basically untick opml and media tracking and junk in the header I think thats it.. and you can fix the headers of avis as well if they dont play on your smart tv.
,beechyboy,2013-04-22T14:48Z,"Thanks for taking the time  to explain this ""optimization for  ___TV's ""  I use a WD TV Live media player that plays ANY type of video file."
[V],psspss,2013-04-22T16:28Z,no worries but if your ripping xvids for all then best to try to make it work on most things also avimuxgui will make sure audio is aligned on interleaves the only thing I havent worked out is why some times it wont play on xbox.. but I suspect its to do with avis being 360p not 352p or frame rate not 23.9 but not sure as I dont own a xbox or ps3 :)
