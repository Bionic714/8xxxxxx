::Storyline::-

Everyone's dancing and making merry in the Khullar household, especially Tej who is all set to gift would-be son-in-law Raj and daughter Tanvi a brand new Maruti Ertiga gaddi on their wedding day. While the wedding preparations are in full swing, Tej's son Sameer is the daft guy who aspires to woo the hot 'Shakira of Chandigarh' Jazzleen. She calls him 'psychic' (thinking it's the same as 'psycho') and he tells her, 'I am love you'. In order to patau the pataka, Sameer uses the new car and ends up losing it! The car goes missing, thus forcing Sameer and his best friend Gattu to form a complex web of lies to save Sameer from the wrath of his father
