,Pyrogreg,2013-04-21T11:22Z,Will this give the not genuine error or not?

,akguru47,2013-04-22T14:57Z,Need Windows 7 Enterprise Edition x86 or AIO. Thanks in Advance ;)
[V],murphy78,2013-04-22T22:59Z,"I do them every month and I've just started my testing. If everything goes well, it should be up later tonight."
,jmg0825,2013-04-23T00:42Z,@murph78 what is the reason you do these every month murph if i may ask?
[V],murphy78,2013-04-23T05:54Z,"The kb files my friend...
It's not necessary to download these every month, but I make them for people who like to have updated versions of windows for when they install/re-install.

A lot of malware can be blocked by simply updating your system. Some malware goes undetected and goes to town on your system if you don't update your kb files.

I've personally seen it happen on a crypted exe I ran on non-updated system. Updated system blocked the crypted file's actions.  While you may not be able to detect every piece of malware out there, you may be able to block a lot of their harmful effects by keeping your system up to date.

Anyhow, I found a flaw in my testing for the AIO. I'm going to re-make the AIO and fix a few things, so it will likely go up tomorrow night, provided testing goes well."

,LuzanelL,2013-04-27T00:02Z,"Okay, so i got this torrent, burned this to a standard DVD-R, and tried to do a simple install (toss out everything prior, start fresh). Unfortunetly, i can't seem to complete the install... The application just give me an error, wich I will trascribe here:

Windows cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation.
Error code: 0x80070017

And while this seems easy enough, i'm sure that my dvd was burnt properly. So can I get some help? thanks in advance."
,LuzanelL,2013-04-27T04:57Z,"Whew, nevermind... probably a DVD driver issue. Anyway, I just used the tool to make the USB DVD and it's working just fine so far, thanks a lot murphy78 :)"

,segree,2013-05-01T04:40Z,"I Have to ask. There was no clear instructions on how to install this copy. Needless to say I installed it easy as ever. My question is do I need to download and run Windows Loader by Daz or is it already done? Sorry, I have no idea what Pre-Activated really mean as I have gotten copies before that said it was but wasn't. BTW... Thanks for this copy."
