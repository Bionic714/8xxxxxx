One question the othe w7U from april also took quite long to install this one will take long as well?

tys ."
[V],murphy78,2013-04-21T04:09Z,"Depends how slow your hard drive is. On a slow hard drive, like an older laptop it can take up to 45 minutes... On newer hard drives it only takes about 20 mins."
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-21T04:53Z,tys for answering Murphy happy weekend.
,yopyop42,2013-04-21T08:24Z,thanks bro appreciate it
,dedcel,2013-04-21T09:44Z,"Question regarding the use of this: will it kill my install if I update using Windows Updater? Am I capable of using Microsoft Security Essentials at all?

Just curious, as I'm using this as a temporary measure currently."
[V],murphy78,2013-04-21T11:02Z,"Yes, your system will pass the genuine check, so you should have no trouble using security essentials. I have included all of the current kb files, but you can enable updating if you want."
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-21T12:05Z,too bad there are more leechers then seeders :(
[T],prodallasosoft,2013-04-21T14:21Z,I do not understand why you have 100s of versions. Only a Question?
,Quronja,2013-04-21T18:20Z,Thanks man....
,Bittornado,2013-04-22T02:48Z,And now that's exactly what I've been waiting for... again thank you soooo much murphy for all the incredible hard work :)
,netusername,2013-04-22T05:20Z,"No, I don't think it's late at all and is actually a good thing that this got released. This will last for approx 20 days until the May edition is released, but that's not the point. Will be seeding this."
,dedcel,2013-04-22T05:22Z,Thank you for the response and your work on this. :)
,dodekaeder,2013-04-22T21:38Z,"Thank you Mr. Murphy78.

Use it to install on ASUS X55DV after reformatting with low lvl utility (to remove HHD lock)

works great except i have 3 days left ;)

then start the Loader from DAZ + advanced
playing around with options and get it done

Thanks!"
[V],murphy78,2013-04-22T22:58Z,"Indeed. Some systems need to use loader advanced options to correctly run.  If this is a bit over your head, just hang tite for my AIO that I'm testing and just use a KMS-Activated index. Since it doesn't use the loader, it won't have the compatibility problem. Loader is obviously preferable, but the new KMS Server Service is nearly instant re-activation. I doubt anyone would even know when it happens."
,pajama28,2013-04-23T06:06Z,"Great work, well just wondering why these three are not included in the integration, 
KB2658846, KB2706045, KB2758857

Did you purposely not include this important ""Security Updates for Win7 4 x64 based System""
because this are bad/faulty updates? or does this updates detects the win7 authenticity?

Pls help, having doubts if I have to install this non optional updates."
[V],murphy78,2013-04-23T13:06Z,"pajama, you can download and install any kb files you want on win7. They already did their genuine thing and winloader won that contest.

I included all the kb files that satisfy windows update, but if you install another language it's likely that it will try to get you to re-download a few kb files, as some of the kb files patch some of the localized information."
,KLawless,2013-04-23T20:00Z,OK.. All I need to do is plug and play? Or is there tweeking need done?
[V],murphy78,2013-04-23T22:23Z,It's up to you KLawless. My releases just update the kb files and add an activator install. Everything else is your doing. This is intentional. Not everyone wants to have a logon picture of the 'haz cheezburger' cat or whatever. I purposefully limit my additions to Microsoft software and activators.
,whateveryou,2013-04-23T22:50Z,Using v1 of April x64 2013 on an Acer 522 without a hitch.  That USB key boot maker is an amazing addition.  Thanx!
,KLawless,2013-04-24T02:24Z,"ok, question.. After ""Completing Installation"" my box restarts and stalls at the ""Starting Windows"" screen right before the Windows is preparing your computer for first use. Is this common? What is the work around? I've had this issue with 3 different iso's now."
,ShyGuyHC,2013-04-24T07:13Z,Thanks for all these updates to so many versions. Helping techs out everywhere. Much Appreciated.
[V],murphy78,2013-04-24T12:15Z,"klawless that sounds like a problem during the system detection phase of bootup. What I would do is remove and replace each piece of non-essential hardware one at a time until it works correctly, then perhaps use something else.

I've heard stories of people having problems using their video card hooked up to a hdmi tv. I've heard problems of people using cheap video capture cards. I've had a family member with a super-cheap wifi card constantly crashing their system.  You didn't give enough details for me to help you further, but if you have some suspect hardware, you might start there."
[V],murphy78,2013-04-24T12:16Z,"yw shy, I used to be a tech myself."
,KLawless,2013-04-24T16:39Z,ty for your help. I've never had trouble like this with a dl before and I have been using cracked software since the hey day of warez.
,Lisjani,2013-04-24T19:59Z,"The installation i stuck at ""Expanding Windows (0%) "" for 15 minutes now.Is there anything i can do about it or it just won't work?

I got a HP 360 Notebook btw."
,bugthebug,2013-04-26T18:08Z,"Great Upload, installed perfectly for me. Thanks for the excellent work."
,bugthebug,2013-04-26T18:10Z,"BTW Everyone whos install got stuck, just be patient. There is a hell of a lot to unpack from this iso, go read a book or fuck someone or something. It'll be done when you get back."
,til_roque,2013-04-26T19:49Z,"noob question: if i don't care about all the security patches and .net updates, can I just d/l official iso from digi river and use daz loader?"
,soccerjoe,2013-04-27T03:26Z,"Has anyone been able to install this on a Mac? I'm trying to install this via Bootcamp and when it tries to boot into the disc, I just get a black screen with a blinking underscore symbol.

Any help would be appreciated!"
,david-lynch,2013-04-27T16:12Z,"Please accept my sincere thanks for doing this image. I'm testing here and so far it is just perfect!

Thanks and best regards!"

,BAPEsta,2013-04-29T03:05Z,How do I install this with USB?
,apex2000,2013-04-29T05:38Z,"I have a problem with .NET Framework 4.5 Installer on an HP desktop computer. The installer verifies the files as correct and then installation proceeds. The installation progress bar goes across to about 80% and then stops with little or no hard drive activity. I have waited for about 15 minutes and nothing further happens. The only option is a hard restart. After restarting, .NET Framework 4.5 appears to be installed but anything that was to be installed afterwards has been missed - for example the activation is not completed.

Anyone have any ideas?

I have checked the SHA-1 hash and it is correct.

Never had a problem with anything from Murphy before, so this was a surprise."
,stub_b,2013-05-01T07:52Z,"It keeps crashing and now I got BSD.
Besides that - it is not activated after install?
I need it to be activated since I can't run Daz activator in UEFI.

Keep up the good Work - I think you're doing great!"

,simiromba,2013-05-04T06:56Z,"Optimum download! Here in Brazil I was forced to cancel automatic Windows updates since it was doing updates without my knowledge thus locking the whole system!
Canceled these updates right in the middle of windows installation! Because when I start the system when the option to cancel the automatic updates was not going right, but doing so in the middle of the installation I gave right.

And another to see the windows trying to update anonymously i used nod32 putting the firewall interactively.

Here in my parents windows 8 this is not earning much space and thus are trying to damage the facilities of windows 7.

Thank you ... Murphy78"
