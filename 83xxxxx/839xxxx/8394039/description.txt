Kill County's second album, The Year of Getting By, is as sparse and expansive as the Western plains from which it came. Recorded in two weeks time at a friend's house in Nebraska, The Year of Getting By is a selection of austere alt-country songs.

An intimate collection of modest, melancholic tracks that are sung either in a brooding baritone or a sorrowful tenor and features straightforward stringwork on the mandolin, dobro, upright bass, acoustic guitar, banjo and sometimes piano. Mostly slow-tempo sad songs, themes of nomadic rambling, struggle and isolation prevail throughout the record starting with opener ΓÇ£Time PassingΓÇ¥ which incorporates all the themes and sets the tone. And, again in ΓÇ£The Train, The Drink, and The Dawn,ΓÇ¥ the themes are present in its dismal and tragic tale unraveling the narrators' heartbreaking circumstances. The stark arrangement and sorrowful vocals in ΓÇ£Western TownΓÇ¥ is beautifully dreary while the up-tempo banjo and soaring vocals on ΓÇ£Left My HomeΓÇ¥ is hopeful.

Nothing I could say could do The Year of Getting By justice or adequately describe my admiration for the album and Kill County. All I can say is, there's no bones about it, the bare-bone arrangements and desolate stories make an amazing alt-country album.
