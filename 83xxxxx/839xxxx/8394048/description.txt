Roller Coaster 3 for Mac users. Tested and works on Mountain lion, (10.8.3) I would appreciate if someone confirms that it works in Lion (10.7) Chur.


Install:

-Unzip the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.zip
-Open the RCT3.v1.2A_11332_.UBCracked.dmg and click agree
-Drag the Panda into the folder created by the .zip, and click replace
-Enjoy

-Seed

Any questions, post in comments.
