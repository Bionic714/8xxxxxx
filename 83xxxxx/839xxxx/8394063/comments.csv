[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-21T19:17Z,"oskar5000, i looked for them at 7 or 8 sites and unfortunately, i can't find any of them.

so if you can, please share those that you do have!"
,oskar5000,2013-04-22T03:39Z,TYVM anyway for your time and trouble  :)
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-22T04:11Z,you're welcome! i'll keep an eye out for those -- i'd like to have them myself!
,tdurden83,2013-04-23T06:11Z,"Thanks for the 1.7 GBs of ALF!! I'll never read em, but I gotta have em. What else is the external HD I bought for, if not a crap load of ALF comics?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-23T14:20Z,someday your hard drive with the ALF collection will be discovered by the grandchildren of your grandchildren and archived by the interplanetary library of 20th century marvels. LOL
,kingdaddy187,2013-04-23T17:05Z,"i asked for this about 2 weeks  ago and you came thru, thank you so much, this has made my day and my kids are gonna flip out on these, you r the best"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-23T21:41Z,"you're welcome. i'm glad to hear that. ALF holiday special 2 was one of the comics i bought with my allowance when i was 10 years old, so that's nice that you're passing on a love of reading!

and yeah, it just takes some time to get the whole set. the Marvel Chronology torrents are great, but downloading from them is slow at times."
,tdurden83,2013-04-23T23:26Z,"lol. I can only hope that when they see them ALF will become their greatest role model in life, the way he became mine"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T00:19Z,lmao!
