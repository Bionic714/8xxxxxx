Bread was a rock band from Los Angeleles, California. They placed 13 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart between 1970 and 1977 and were a prime example of what later was labeled soft rock.

This is the remastered 1996 release featuring their hits starting from 1969 to David Gates solo recordings in 1978.

These wonderful songs have stood the test of time and are an essential part of any 70ΓÇÖs soft rock collection.
