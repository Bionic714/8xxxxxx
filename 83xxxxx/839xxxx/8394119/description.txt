After an electrifying return from the bottom of his Crystal Lake grave, indestructible psycho-slasher Jason Voorhees ships out to visit the Big Apple and paints the town red! High school senior Rennie Wickham is in for the ride of her life - and possibly her death - when she and her classmates take a graduation cruise bound for New York City. Little do they know that crazed serial killer Jason is a stowaway who quickly transforms the teen-filled "love boat" celebration into the ultimate voyage of the damned!
