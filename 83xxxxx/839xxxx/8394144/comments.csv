It's unfortunate that it's the year 2013 and people are still believing in these silly myths. Childhood indoctrination is a hard nut to crack, but not impossible.

Why exactly does a being who exists through every stitch of existence even need apologists to try to 'prove' that it exists?

Zeus, Poseidon, Yahweh, The Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Angels, Demons, Devils, Leprechauns don't exist. *Now come to present time and expand your mind.*

Also, don't ask about 'infinite regression.'"

Tzaddi, I suspect that very few moderns here on TPB are actually non-atheists.
Thank you to Simrana1 for sharing these.  I will put them to good use.  Though probably not as the author had intended."
