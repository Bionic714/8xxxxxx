,pwnt_soup,2013-04-22T00:47Z,amazing how people will pile on when someone makes a goof. thanks to the up loader for his effort and i bet he will fix it sooner or later.
,CrankEMan,2013-04-22T07:47Z,"pipe down pwnt_soup, you weak kneed titty sucker. Neither of us have piled on skJGZV6z. I hold skJGZV6z in my top 5 regular contributors of all time for his longevity in faithfully contributing Stossel content. Stop with the crybaby liberal hyperbole in a Libertarian thread."
,pwnt_soup,2013-04-23T01:33Z,sounds like your the one cryin and that's all the troll food you will get for me
,CrankEMan,2013-04-23T05:25Z,A legend in your own feeble mind. Enjoy your madness pwnt_poop.
,CalvinDeWitt,2013-04-23T05:27Z,"I enjoy catching Stossel's show as I don't have FOX business, Thanks a lot!

Any idea when a fixed file will be available for download?"
