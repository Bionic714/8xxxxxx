
About Microsoft Toolkit 2.4.3


This is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing, deploying, and activating Microsoft Office and Windows. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as they could conflict or cause damage if run concurrently. The Microsoft Office Setup Customization Functions (Customize Setup Tab), AutoKMS Uninstaller (if AutoKMS is installed), AutoRearm Uninstaller (if AutoRearm is installed), Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Microsoft Office or Windows is not installed/supported. For information about individual functions, read further.

Requirements:
Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 or 4.5 (Not 3.5)
Microsoft Office 2010 or Later for Office Toolkit Support 
Windows Vista or Later for Windows Toolkit Support

Microsoft Toolkit FAQ

My AV/Firewall Detected a Virus when activating.:  
Most major AVΓÇÖs have decided to flag KMSEmulator as a virus/hack tool, because it can be used for piracy and many AVΓÇÖs flag cracks. The file is completely safe but you must add it to your AV exclusions for proper use of KMS activation. 
So add AutoKMS's (%WINDIR%AutoKMSAutoKMS.exe),  KMS Server Services's (%WINDIR%KMSServerServiceKMS Server Service.exe), and KMSEmulator's (%WINDIR%Microsoft.NETFrameworkv2.0.50727vbc.exe) path to AV/Firewall exclusions.

Can I really trust these files?:
They are confirmed safe by MDL community and our reputations would be damaged if we were trying to infect you, but if you still donΓÇÖt trust the files donΓÇÖt use KMS activation. You can use AutoRearm to keep Microsoft Office in grace period forever without any AV Configuration/False Positive hassles.

I tried to activate via KMS and it failed.:
First be 100% sure your AV and any security products (including built in Windows Products) are not interfering. 
In any other case, please post to the forum with the output when you attempted activation.

Microsoft Office licensing is shot/Setup window shows on start of Office/I get red bar and nag.: 
If your Microsoft Office licensing gets damaged or marked as tampered, Microsoft Office will try to repair itself and when it does you will be in Notifications Mode (with 0 rearms). The only way to resolve this is to activate Microsoft Office successfully (YouΓÇÖll have to use KMS due to lack of MAK/Retail keys). If you successfully activate youΓÇÖll be activated with 5 rearms. 

I have an issue or question not contained in this readme.:
If you are experiencing a problem and you have read through relevant parts of the readme (99% of questions I am asked are contained here in the readme so I donΓÇÖt answer those due to it being a lack of time and delaying those with questions/problems not in the readme. If you have a question that isnΓÇÖt related to issues with activation troubleshooting, freely ask. Otherwise follow the troubleshooting steps so you can post all the info I need to help you.

Troubleshooting/Support Guide

General:
1. Please do not send support requests via PM. My PM fills up quick and other people besides me can help if you post it publicly. 
2. Not following the rest of this guide will mean I will ignore the post. "KMS failed please help" does not give me enough info.
3. Be absolutely 100% positive no AV/Firewall/Security are interfering. There are few reasons KMS fails and this is the main one. Do not assume things are OK because no alert occurred, make sure things are excluded.
Steps:
1. For whatever the problem is, if applicable, copy a full amount of the output/log. EX; If AutoKMS is failing get the AutoKMS.log contents, if another function is failing get all of the output sent to the Information Console.
2. Get the output of Check Activation Status
3. Post the output gathered in Step 2. If it is large, dump it to pastebin.org or a similar site and post the link to that dump in Microsoft Toolkit thread and explain that you had problems. You may have to obfuscate it (hxxp:// instead of http://) if your post count is too low to post links.
