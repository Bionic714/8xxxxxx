   Learn how easy it is to design and build responsive, cross-platform       
   apps with the Enyo open source JavaScript framework. With this hands-on   
   book, Enyo contributor Roy Sutton shows you how to get started with the   
   framework's core object-oriented features, including its modular          
   design, reusable and extensible components, layout and widget             
   libraries, easy-to-use deployment options, and support for HTML5          
   standards. Before you know it, you'll be writing native-quality apps      
   that work equally well on smartphones, tablets, and desktops. Are you     
   familiar with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? Then you're ready for Enyo.       
   Start with a sample project to get the feel of Enyo right away Learn      
   about Enyo's "kinds" (component building blocks), encapsulation,          
   inheritance, and other core features Design compelling and responsive     
   apps with Enyo's layout strategies and Layout library Use existing        
   components to create new components Build unique user interfaces with     
   the Onyx library and widget set Explore the community gallery to find     
   and share reusable components Tackle debugging, performance tuning, and   
   globalization Package your app for web, desktop, and mobile targets,
