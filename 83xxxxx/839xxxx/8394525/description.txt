Note:
1.Please don't ask me to do any further small sized rips because it will 
lead to compromise with the quality. So if you want good quality then only 
download it and moreover the rip size is fairly small enough taken total
number of episodes and quality which you won't get anywhere else.Still if you 
want small sized rips then ok fine there are other torrents with 39 episodes,you
can go for them.

2.My internet is not very fast so i may not be seeding at some times but i 
will return back quickly and seed again for sure till others start seeding
it and the torrent gets fair number of seeders for its persistence. So in
that case please don't loose your calm,have patience and don't write abusive comments here. I am doing it for you only.But still in case if you want i 
will give you an alternate youtube link where you can download the remaining
number of episodes you are falling short of in case no seeding is available
Here is the link:
