Book Description
For anyone making the journey into the world of service design, this book, informed by its authorsΓÇÖ hard-won knowledge and field experience, should be your first stop.ΓÇ¥
ΓÇöJesse James Garrett, author of The Elements of User Experience

We have unsatisfactory experiences when we use banks, buses, health services and insurance companies. They donΓÇÖt make us feel happier or richer. Why are they not designed as well as the products we love to use such as an Apple iPod or a BMW?

The ΓÇÿdevelopedΓÇÖ world has moved beyond the industrial mindset of products and the majority of ΓÇÿproductsΓÇÖ that we encounter are actually parts of a larger service network. These services comprise people, technology, places, time and objects that form the entire service experience. In most cases some of the touchpoints are designed, but in many situations the service as a complete ecology just ΓÇ£happensΓÇ¥ and is not consciously designed at all, which is why they donΓÇÖt feel like iPods or BMWs.

One of the goals of service design is to redress this imbalance and to design services that have the same appeal and experience as the products we love, whether it is buying insurance, going on holiday, filling in a tax return, or having a heart transplant. Another important aspect of service design is its potential for design innovation and intervention in the big issues facing us, such as transport, sustainability, government, finance, communications and healthcare.

Service Design is an eminently practical guide to designing services that work for people. It offers powerful insights, methods, and case studies to help you design, implement, and measure multichannel service experiences with greater impact for customers, businesses, and society.

Along with many other insights, this book offers:
- A clear explanation of what service design is and what makes it different from other ways of thinking about design, marketing and business.
- Service design insights, methods and case studies to help you move up the project food chain and have a bigger design impact on the entire service ecosystem.
- Practical advice to help you sell the value of service thinking within your organisation and to clients.
- Ways to help you develop business, design, environmental and social innovation through service design.
