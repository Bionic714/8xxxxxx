Friends, this video is a collection of few mistakes I noticed in this movie. I don't mean to hurt anybody. Created this video as part of my video editing tool study and thought of sharing with you all. We saw the real potential of Mr. Rajamouli with this unique story line and creative approach towards execution of his father's idea. 

It is universal truth that this movie is one if its kind and one of the few unforgettable movies of TFI.

With all due respect to the entire team behind this movie, I once again convey that I made this video as part of an activity but not with any bad intention. 

It is universal fact that it is not possible to make a movie without mistakes.
