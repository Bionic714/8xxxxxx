,Who-He-iZ,2013-04-21T16:24Z,"ISLAM really seems to be the root of EVIL. 
Why don't the Imam's take any responsibility ? 
I mean if you're a true Muslim and start to pray 5 times a day instead of 1 (like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26 did) so why is it that Muslims will become that kind of fanatics that spread just hate ? Think that these 2 brothers had been kindly taken as refugees to USA and was living there good life's, then this is the thanks for everything ? Why ? What are those Muslim religious leaders teaching ? Why do they have to start hating their neighbors instead of showing love and compassion towards them ? There must be something fundamentally wrong with Islam. I really think that we should stop immigrating Muslims to our EU and that you in the USA should do the same. Worldly Muslims are no problem but alas become a true Muslim and soon you'll see a bombing somewhere - where next ?"
,ch_adeel_92,2013-04-21T20:24Z,That's like comparing KKK to Christianity. These extremists say their Muslim and may even pray 5 times a day that doesn't make them Muslim. there are 2.6 million Muslims in the US. Do you see us all yelling death to America? The root of the cause is growing up in a poverty stricken county and being told America is the cause and revenge is the answer.

95% of all victims of islamic terror are muslims. And you dare to say this is just a social issue in poverty stricken muslim countries? Saudi? Iran? 
Islam is a culture of evil patriarchal fascism and pure racism. Al Taqiyya is your real name..."
