Grow is not your typical fish game where you wait for your pet fish to grow and mindlessly tap on the screen to feed it. WeΓÇÖre not catching fishes today so go ahead and throw away your fishing equipments. DonΓÇÖt go bothering the angry birds, theyΓÇÖll never be happy with their revenge. Be ready to be hungry, very hungry, even hungrier than a shark because, in Grow, your job is to eat everything in the aquarium!


You are a little fish with a big appetite and dreams. So you eat. And eat. Till eventually, you Grow. From a cramped jar to the open sea, play the adventure mode to explore different habitats.
