When you say ""install all updates"" can you possibly tell us which ones you installed (how many, where you got them, etc)?"

,jagru,2013-04-27T15:55Z,"@backstreet
try this dude,
1. open your updater and wait it to confirm if you want to install it.. (But don't yet install it)
2. press (windows key + r) to open the run..
3. after that, type this in run window -> ""C:Users\AppdataTemp
4. you look for a folder that has a name ""{ 9C... }"" something like that. 
5. You delete the folder ""multi"" in Disk1deltaFiles
6. And now you proceed on your installation process in you updater."
,backstreet,2013-04-27T23:14Z,"@jagru,Thank you for your idea, I did everything what you wrote, but the problem has not gone away .. :-("
,ckd1992,2013-05-04T13:23Z,"@backstreet, if still not working then try 1.05 reloaded patch..."
