1280x720p is also common, which is probably where the confusion lies.

(A lot of ""cinematic"" content is actually delivered letterboxed as a super-wide 1920x800/1920x816 format.  Cropping video to remove letterboxing can significantly improve file-size/compression. 720x400p is common for low-res DVD and BluRay rips.)"
