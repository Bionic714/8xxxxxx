This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

So, Carl Cox, what can you say about a man who so consistently pumps out fantastic sets and works so damn hard at it that at the Ultra Music Festival, he gets his own damn ARENA. Like totally named after him. The man has been playing a blend of techno, drum and bass with the ocassional house track thrown in that he has a style all of his own. I have been lucky enough to see Carl Cox a few times, and each and every time, the set is simply amazing. I normally loathe an MC talking over the music, but when Carl gets chatty, it seems to somehow fit into the whole. For me, that's saying a heck of a lot about how amazing this DJ is.
