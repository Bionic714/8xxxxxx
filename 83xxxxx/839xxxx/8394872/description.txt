This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

In this pack, Cosmic Gate. There from the start, still going strong. If you think back to all the anthems you have heard, these guys are in there probably more than once. With amazing singles like Firewire, Exploration of Space, Back to Earth and more that have never really truly left the playlists around the world. This pack contains over 12 hours!

I have avoided sets that are too new or likely easy to find and stuck to ones that I think should hang around for many years to come!

These are all amazing, but Orgasmatron in Italy, Rosenmontags Germany and Kontor really stand out in my mind as sets that I couldn't stop listening to.
