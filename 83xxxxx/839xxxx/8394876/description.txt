This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

DJ Rush has been around for a damned long time and is still pumping out Motherfucking Bass (Bonus points if you see what I did there!). An early pioneer in the scene, he started drifting towards a more minimal heavier sound and has done a lot as a well known icon to help promote fresh talent, either by making remixes of their work or by assisting them and publishing them on his label Kne'Deep. The sets here should show his depth as a DJ, from Tresor Berlin (OMG!), Nature one and two parts of a set I have tracked down from Chicago from 1990!! Enjoy over eight hours of Rush.
