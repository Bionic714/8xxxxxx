This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

Johan Gielen, the name on the lips of all those who go to Trance Energy. Resident DJ there, he has always produced a set that is memorable for years and the crowd explode when he gets to the decks. The other half of Svenson & Gielen, Johan has been producing trance for many years and is known for remixes a mile long. If you haven't had the chance to see him live, seriously, do yourself a favour, you will be the envy of all your peers.
