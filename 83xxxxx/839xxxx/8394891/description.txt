This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

In my mind, this guy is a quiet achiever. He plays amazing sets, always right on the button and technically excellent. Sadly I don't have as many sets of Marco V as I really would like to, but even in this small pack, the events show just how good he is. The music is uplifting trance, energetic, lively and happy. TO me, the perfect sort of set for a good party. Now matter how tired you are, you can always get out there when Marco V is playing and sweat out another hour.
