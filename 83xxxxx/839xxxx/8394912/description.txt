This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

Surgeon is a true pioneer of dance music, starting Birmingham's first Techno Club - House of God - perhaps you have heard of it in certain tracks? His DJing style is more than just putting out a good beat, but looking to make a true tapestry and artistic message of each set. An interesting person and a fantastic DJ (really, you should google for interviews with him) he makes a grand entrance to this pack.
