This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

There is one and only Godfather of Techno. Sven Vath. Iconic the world over, he has made a significant impact on the sounds we all listen to. From his early days at Omen (and Vogue and The Dorian Gray) through to Amnesia (yes, THAT one) and to major festivals the world over.

Without further rambling, please do thoroughly enjoy this pack which contains almost twenty four hours of the Grandfather.
