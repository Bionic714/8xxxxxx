This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

Talla 2XLC began DJ'ing in 1979! Again, that's probably before you were even born. His DJ'ing career is easily identified as one that defines dance music rather than following in the footsteps of others. His really early work featured a lot of heavy industrial sounds and gradually moved to Trance and what he describes as Epic Trance. Being friendly and doing a lot with Cosmic Gate, he has more than earned his pass into this pack with just shy of seven hours of fantastic sets.
