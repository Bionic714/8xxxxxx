In 1951 at Fort Detrick, Maryland, construction crews built a hollow metal sphere four stories high. Inside germ weapons were to be exploded, creating mists of infectious aerosols for testing on animals....and people. Employees called it the eight ball. In their eighteen month long journey Grey and Russell travel the country in search of answers and interview top experts in the world of Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases. Under the Eight ball includes live footage, historical documents, original animation and archival military footage.

The revolutionary, independent documentary UNDER THE EIGHTBALL, chronicles investigative journalist Lori Hall-SteeleΓÇÖs battle with Lyme Disease as her brother, director Timothy Grey, and friend, Breanne Russell, set out on a mission to uncover its illusive and often misunderstood origins.

UNDER THE EIGHTBALL promises to shift paradigms.
