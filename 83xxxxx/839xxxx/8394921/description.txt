This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

Right here, Umek. Hailing from Slovenia, he started DJ'ing in 1993 - so right off the bat, we have a veteran! Every year, for his birthday, he organizes Dan elektronike (Electronica Day). On the technical side, this guy plays off FOUR (COUNT THAT AGAIN... FOUR!) turntables simultaneously. His sets are energetic, the crowd loves him and he seems to go from one amazing gig to another - as the events in the pack below show. Mayday, Nature One, MOS Sessions, there aren't too many folks that can lay claim to all those. If you aren't a fan yet, do yourself a favour. Snag these and join the rest of us in appreciating this guy for what he is.
