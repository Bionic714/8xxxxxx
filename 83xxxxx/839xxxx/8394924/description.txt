This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

Warmduscher might not be as common a name here as some of the others that I have included in these, but as far as being influential, Warmduscher was one of the few DJs who spawned a whole new genre of dance music - Hardstyle. With his pounding beats and jagged buildups, his style of music and track selections inspired a whole new generation of DJs to follow his style and now Hardstyle is as commonplace as the other genres of electronic dance music.

Sadly, I don't have as much as I would like to have, but here are some sweet tasty morsels for your delights.
