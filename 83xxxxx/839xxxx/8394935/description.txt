Bow Thayer and Perfect TrainwreckΓÇÖs album, Eden, was written almost entirely on electric banjo and fuses experimental elements with Americana, rock, bluegrass, and folk, resulting in a singular, progressive sound that has earned the Vermont-based band descriptions ranging from ΓîáGreen Mountain soul to Γîámodern backwoods music.]

American Songwriter declared that Thayer is ΓÇ£the best Producer to come from New England in recent yearsΓÇ¥ and says Eden is ΓÇ¥ as adventuresome as anything currently out there in the Americana fieldΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ¥ excellent all the way throughΓÇ¥. Relix says the ΓÇ£quality of the songwriting and the careful precision of the arrangementsΓÇªbrings to mind Dave Matthews Band though Thayer and his band rock much harder.ΓÇ¥ Seven Days observes that the band ΓÇ£present well-crafted flights of fancy rooted in typically potent songwritingΓÇ¥ that push in a new direction ΓÇ£that could attract legions of new fans.ΓÇ¥ And Farce The Music sums it up this way: ΓÇ£Think early Wilco with a broader sound or a modernized version of The Band and youΓÇÖve got an idea of Bow Thayer and Perfect TrainwreckΓÇÖs M.O.ΓÇ¥
