Instead of telling the stories of the witnesses of the paranormal, the idea of this series is to tell the story from the GHOSTS viewpoint.

Which of course is all made up. In the end, you are just confused about what the ""real"" stories are, and what the witnesses have seen or not seen.

What makes a good ghost story scary is the mystique of the unknown, or ""the other side"" which you can not see. This is just making a parody of it."
