Learn to adapt and survive the coldest and highest points in the world.
 It is difficult to imagine how anyone would enter into a polar or mountainous region unprepared. YouΓÇÖre prepared for your journey or you arrive by accident; for example, the aircraft you are traveling in has crash-landed over the frozen tundra, or your mode of transport has broken down in the wilderness. In all cases, providing you are uninjured, your chances of survival are good. Planned travel in a cold or mountainous environment should mean that you are well clothed and equipped.
 
In both winter and summer, the Northern Arctic offers an abundant supply of water and food; shelter can be found or constructed above and below the tree line. The real threat comes from the cold, injury, and simply doing nothing.
 
During the Second World War a number of service men became marooned in the arctic wastelandΓÇömost of them died. They did so because few ventured far from their crash site, they made no attempt to catch fish, hunt game, or even attempt to travel south. None that were later found had prepared a rescue signal, and most had died not from the cold but from starvation.
