,MAA11792,2013-04-21T21:19Z,"It won't work, easy install and all that other nonsense, but still.. it does not work."
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-21T23:24Z,"Ive tried everyone's torrents for this game, and they all suck and barely work. not saying this one is like the others, just to risky to download if it wont work..."

This can surely help you guys in running the game, with this link you can download a patch that will update StarFriend in the installed game to version 1.45.

Fixed bugs reset (will not turn off the music 
after a restart of the game)."
,MAA11792,2013-04-22T07:20Z,"In my humble opinion, either buy this game or play some Brood War, because this shit won't work."
,trap205,2013-04-22T15:17Z,Can anyone confirm is this working ????
,mpegdecoder01,2013-04-22T16:21Z,"This won't work.

No successful logon, no play.

Starfriend.....DAWN SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,IzayaOrihara,2013-04-26T11:30Z,"The one by stifmeister worked for me, go get that one.
 You do have to manually add a exception to a certain exe (as the instructions say) though, and erase your Starcraft II folder in your documents (Or something inside of it that saves update info)."
,xuancong,2013-04-29T09:28Z,"Thanks, it works on my Windows 7 x64. But without a proper README file, few people can figure out. You have to login using username ""gg@gl.hf"" with password ""gg"". In custom game, never click ""Create game"", right-click the map and select ""create offline map""."

,LunarisDream,2013-05-25T04:56Z,"@saio00 That is not enough to play SCII:HotS, especially since it sounds like your system uses regular RAM as graphics memory if you're running on integrated graphics, which I suspect you are with those low specs. 

Need a better computer dude. If you have a monitor, you can build a computer that will max SCII for $500."
,saio00,2013-05-25T21:53Z,LunarisDream I allready played hots on that pc and I have dual core pc so the license is generated and I do not wan't to get more ram becose i want my pc to be on xp I allso tried to put another videocard but still the same result if someone can upload an installed version of that torrent I will be verry happy becose the installation is the only problem...
