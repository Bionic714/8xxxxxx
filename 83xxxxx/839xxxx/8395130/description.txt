DESCRIPTION:

AI RoboForm is a push-button web form filler with some serious Artificial Intelligence (AI) inside. AI RoboForm allows you to define your personal profile or ΓÇ£usualΓÇ¥ responses to a web form. This information is then saved within AI RoboForm, and when you need to fill a form, just click ΓÇ£Fill FormsΓÇ¥ button, and form is filled out. Being fully client-based AI RoboForm can be very fast, it never disables web site functions and AI RoboForm can also work in pop-up HTML windows. The most important feature of AI RoboForm is high accuracy ΓÇô it fills 95% of all fields correctly.

INSTALLATION NOTES

Install AiRoboForm-Enterprise.exe.  After installation make
sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer
windows are closed or else the file(s) will not copy over
properly (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into
safe mode if you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll and
roboform-x64.dll (x64 dll is only needed for IE 64bit!) into AI
Roboform's installed folder, making sure to overwrite the
existing files.  AI Roboform is now in the full PRO version with
Enterprise features.

Included is the Enterprise policies tool with this release so you
don't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the
PolicyEditor folder.
 
Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when
you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a
taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known
as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.
In IE 64bit it may show as Desktop ONLY in the about window, but
if you have chosen Everywhere syncing is still performed
(hopefully fixed in an update).  Its suggested to use a different
RoboForm Everywhere password than your master password.  This way
nobody will be able to decrypt your online database except you.
Note that you can now choose either Everywhere or Desktop type of
installation while first installing AI Roboform.  You can also
tell which type of configuration its currently set at by opening
the About window from the taskbar icon, keep this running if you
want full time syncing with Everywhere.  Everywhere will show
Sync With [USERNAME], while Desktop will not show Sync.  This can
be changed at any time by going into Options then User Data and
clicking on Settings button.

Thats it!  Enjoy.
