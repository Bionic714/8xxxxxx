,Menderz01,2013-04-22T18:09Z,Anyone else having problems with running the game after the game crashes once?
,Khugra,2013-04-22T21:22Z,"Utterly shitty installer.

Can't change install location, and if you try to move it (even though it's named ""portable"") the game no longer works.

Reinstalling fails silently but still gives you the ads page which pops up when you run the installer."
,Smiffy008,2013-04-23T12:13Z,"Works, but is filled with ads

unfortunately you can't change install location"
,Hatredg0d,2013-04-24T02:22Z,"What the fuck are all these ads! Look if i like the game ill buy it and support the devs, but i dont give a fuck about You. DOWNLOAD THE OTHER ONE POSTED SAME DAY A FEW HOURS BEFORE THIS ONE."
,XxCmonxX,2013-04-24T02:29Z,"1st its not full with ads
2nd i already cut the folder Portable from C:
and pasted it to another partition 
and the game is running flawlessly with no problems"

,ultrababa,2013-04-25T02:22Z,"Game is great and works fine.
Thanks for the up Duck!"
,DrTen,2013-04-26T18:28Z,"Installing now. As soon as I double click it tries to open a php file on friendsinwar dot com. Didn't investigate it, just stopped it loading. Besides that, no other sign of ads.

Next, it auto-installs to C:Program Files (x86)Portable (please change this in future uploads, if you have any)

And then it automatically runs the game.

Game seems to run great. Thanks!"
,Chiitah,2013-04-28T17:58Z,"It may not be ""full of ads"" but even one advertisement loading page is one too many, and you can't deny that it does start out at the very start trying to load a web page (which the bought game does not do).

If I don't like it then buy it?  Yes, that's what I did.  But I'd say if others don't like it, download a different version without any web page loads with it :D"
,bashpr0mpt,2013-05-09T12:05Z,"It's nice to see people uploading versions like this. Everything I have ever pirated has worked straight away. Idfk what people think they're doing when they release shit that has huge complex instructions on how to crack and is usually always a rar (rar was great twenty years ago, now lmz / zip compression shits all over it hands down and has for the last ten years at least) and often with a fucking password or something idiotic.

I am a bit iffy about the advert after the installer runs, but it makes sense that The Duck is monetizing his cracks, it costs you nothing (you close it anyway, big whoop) and gives him some incentive to keep uploading stuff and hopefully his habit of pre-cracking no-fucking-around uploads will take off.

Also, google the developers of games before you buy the games to support them. I encountered one indie dev group who are a bunch of psychopaths, Squad, they made Kerbal Space Program. Read my Twitterfeed (@bashpr0mpt) for more info on them, but basically I reviewed their game, they didn't like the review and banned me. Came back later to ask them about allegations they were stealing code wholesale from the community (which they were, and pocketing the cash still) and they took their websites offline and started tweeting that 'bashpr0mpt is attacking us'. I shit you not, logs, etc, all on my Twitter feed to prove it. They're that batshit.

Their answer to stealing other peoples code was 'we live in mexico, let them try and sue us lol'. That said these guys are now trading on STEAM and selling the game for four times what it was being sold for before they conned Steam into distributing them. So don't assume just because it's on steam that the devs are good people, because in that case they definitely aren't (and unfortunately Mexico's laws don't allow for consumer right protection so if you get jipped you have no recourse unless you're in an interventionist nation like AU or CA!)

Thanks The_Duck! And good game all!"
,VegitoDBZ,2013-05-11T00:54Z,crashes after 1 save
,bashpr0mpt,2013-05-17T11:42Z,"WARNING: Game runs once then crashes on second load and never loads again (crashes instantly). No idea, but appears to be a common problem with this distribution. I suggest downloading elsewhere."
,HaVoC_850,2013-05-20T19:05Z,"This works for me. 
As promised - real 1 click install - Perfect upload. 
Saves work as well after you close and re-start the game. 

Good build, didn't find any bugs that disrupted my gameplay.

Thank you uploader. 
I liked the game so much, I bought it from steam for just 15$."
,MrPhoenix220,2013-05-22T22:32Z,Where exactly are the saves stored? I bought the game but I can't find the saved games from this version to transfer them to my new one.
,liam0connor,2013-05-23T14:58Z,i can't seem to open it im running windows 8 and it just says error during initialization can someone help? :)
,MrPhoenix220,2013-05-24T22:02Z,"Can no one tell me where the saves of this version are stored? When I start the updated game, my saves aren't showing and when I start this one, they are right there..."
