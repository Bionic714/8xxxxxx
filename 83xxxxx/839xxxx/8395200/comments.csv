,maqo,2013-04-21T16:17Z,is a TS what do u expect?????
,NoMoreAVI,2013-04-21T17:49Z,"What's with 1280*480, that's not 2.35:1?
Why do people use imageshack.us, they shrink?"

standand low contrast just like all the other cams. Small sections out of focus. Some on-screen captions. Still watchable."
,HKZHIQ,2013-04-22T06:16Z,"I don't think it's ""watchable"" -- very bad video and audio. "
,muscule_boy,2013-04-22T08:08Z,"Is this version the same as the others or it is a new source without the watermarks?

I assume it is the best copy to date but not sure since the ratings seem to indicate that this is not the best version.

Any clarification on the quality is appreciated before I attempt to download... thanks."
,muscule_boy,2013-04-22T08:13Z,"Does this video have watermarks or blurred areas where watermarks have been removed?

I assume that this is the best copy to date but not sure since there are many poor versions out there.

Any clarification on video and audio quality is appreciated so myself and others can decide whether to download this version or not.

Thanks."

very watchable cam though!"
,Calamakuya,2013-04-24T18:25Z,"I will not make any comment at all of how a Cam gets to be in the HD section nor how a Cam, (Besides the equipment itself), gets to make an DH release, therefore I will not comment at all... nope, I will not comment."

,PauloFran,2013-04-25T12:38Z,"Nice copy for a CAM.
Thank you!"
,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-28T07:18Z,"It would be nice if shawnmurthy checked his files before uploading:

This is NOT a TS: This is a Cam.  The same Cam everyone else has already uploaded, though at least it is the version with the tags blurred out."
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-28T08:00Z,Main video is an MKV but sample is an AVI..? Hmmm.......
,magicspin,2013-05-04T14:20Z,"Thanks for the effort, Shawn,
As several have mentioned already - for a cam, this is a very watchable. Video is very nicely letterboxed, the occasional disguised watermark. And yes, as you'd expect, there are short bits out of focus at times - a minute or so's worth 20 minutes from the end. Audio is generally pretty clear - a well-behaved audience, even! I prefer this file size, too. Reasonable quality, quicker to load, quicker to seed, quicker to enjoy.
Keep up the good work. Ciao."

,KaiDedo,2013-05-17T12:28Z,"Danke. Nicht schlecht - es ist doch ""organizierte""
Datei!"
,David89an,2013-05-20T12:32Z,"Blue ray = 10
DVD= 9
Excellent mkv, xvid etc = 8
Excellent cam = 5

This torrent is:
A: 4
V: 4

IMO, the sound is not TS/other source. It sounds like its from the cam."

,YouSuckCam,2013-06-06T11:41Z,"You don't need to handle your camera like a prostitute handles a cock.  No need to put your camera in your ass, when you shoot these videos."
,crazyoliv,2013-06-07T02:11Z,"you my find subs in there : http://subscene.com/subtitles/oblivion-2013/english/729422

don't tell anyone!"
,crazyoliv,2013-06-07T02:34Z,"this camversion is very watchable. It is far better than the very first Fox scam. Congrats to those who helpfully contributed to the sound/picture processing!

no need to bitchin' any longer from now on lads, but adding that Fox itself is a waste of semen that annoyingly did not ended on a napkin. Try birth control next time!

anyhow, the movie itself is pretty lame. besides a nice cinematography, the script, characters, scenario are wooden and tasteless, beyond being completely femally miscast... hell of a shame."
