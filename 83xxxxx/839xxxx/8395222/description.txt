Storyline: Banished there for eternity, Freddy Krueger devises a plan to manipulate Jason into continuing his work, hacking up the teenagers of Elm Street. All goes well at first until Jason realizes he's been duped by 'the dream master' and is none too pleased. Coaxed by the surviving teenagers, Jason and Freddy descend up Crystal Lake for a battle royale, where the two biggest icons of the slasher genre finally meet.
