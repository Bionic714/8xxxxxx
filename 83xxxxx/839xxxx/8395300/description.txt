Since I saw a scan of a Norwegian Ernie/Piranha Club comic here, I figured I would up what US rips we got of it.
The strip is fairly popular in scandinavia, but in the US, there is only a few books out, and King Features Syndicate have the "Well sell you 1 year backlog, if you want more, tough luck" approach to the series, so it is hard to find. This collection is the most we have ever been able to dig up, but I fear that the early strips in english might be lost, unless the syndicates change their business model :thumbsdown:


Piranha Club is the title of a comic strip written and illustrated by Bud Grace. It was originally called Ernie, but the title was changed to the current one in 1998. The club is meant as a parody on Lions Club International, and the strip made its debut in February 1988.

The strip is drawn in detail and appears in color. While the strip is usually stand alone, on many occasions it is serialized with the story running for a week or more on some occasions. The daily strip usually runs to four panels. The Sunday strip is in a three-by-three panel format with the strip logo appearing in the top left panel.

Here is a few select strips, featuring some of the regular cast:
