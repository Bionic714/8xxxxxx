Here is a webrip of a popular danish comic strip called Wulffmorgenthaler (named after the creators), which run in one of the biggest danish newspapers.
Its weird, bizarre, creepy, strange, funny as hell, and its most likely that 1 in 10 strips will make you go "huh" or gross you out, but its worth reading.
It DO contain nudity in a lot of strips, so if you cant stomack that, aviod it :)

Content ranges from sideways political statements to complete non-sequitur, and relies on both intelligent humor and bathroom humor, as well as an abundance of blood, sexual references and grotesque imagery, to get its point across. Reading Wulffmorgenthaler is often an exercise of the imagination, as it has a habit of juxtaposing supremely ordinary characters in supremely unusual situations, or vice versa. Punchlines are delivered by way of dialogue or with one-liners written in a caption below the image. Because the comic is drawn in a non-serial format, delivery and timing are especially important (and difficult to maneuver), and as a result most of the humor in Wulffmorgenthaler relies on the quality of the writing itself rather than the element of surprise that usually lends itself to the traditional comic-strip punchline. No subject is taboo in the world of Wulffmorgenthaler, with recent topics including the Pope, illegitimate sex, and the consumption of aborted fetuses for dinner.

Here are a some of my favorites, should show the general tone of the comic.
Again, be warned that this can contain nudity, gross situations, and will most likely offend someone :)
