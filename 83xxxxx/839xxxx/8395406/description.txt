The Thatcher Story, how The Times and The Sunday Times reported her story.

In death, as in life, Margaret Thatcher divided opinion. The astonishing outpouring of praise and, to a much lesser extent, revulsion since she passed away on Monday shows that just as she hated compromise, people will never change their views about her.

You were for Margaret Thatcher or against her, and she saw the world through that lens as well.

It is amazing, given the mammoth coverage of her death at home and abroad, that Lady Thatcher stepped down from office a full 22 years ago.

The images that have dominated newspapers and television in recent days have made events like the Falklands conflict, the miners' strike, the Brighton bomb and so much more seem far more recent in the memory.

In this ebook we tell the full Thatcher story from the days when, as a front bench Treasury spokesman, she caught the eye of Tory MPs who encouraged her to challenge successfully for the leadership in 1975 to her fall from office. For those of us who were political correspondents at the time it was the biggest story of our careers.

We show the impact of her arrival in Number 10, how her triumph in the South Atlantic helped her to a landslide in 1983, followed by another in 1987, her historic meeting with Gorbachev, the political fiasco of the poll tax, the devastating, fatal attack on her by Sir Geoffrey Howe, and her ultimately failed attempt to ward off the challenge to her supremacy by MPs whom she had handed three election victories.

It is a story dominated by the twin impostors of triumph and disaster. Margaret Thatcher has left the scene but the debate about her contribution to Britain, how she changed the political landscape, weakened the unions, and forever altered the balance between private and public sectors, will never cease. She is box office ΓÇö in death as in life.
