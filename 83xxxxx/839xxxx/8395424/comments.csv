,empsvbest,2013-04-25T02:04Z,"This guy doesn't really upload anything, he just gets this stuff elsewhere and reuploads it here. Sometimes he'll even get stuff from TPB and reupload it to TPB. 

I have been uploading these comics for a while now, even Czardas has been getting them from me. If I don't upload anything nobody else contributes either.

Since drymoused called me a ""troll"" on the other thread, nobody will get these comics from me anymore. It's a pity because 343 is a true masterpiece. Let's see if anyone will step up to the plate now."

Most of the fansadox uploads i see are marked anonymous, if you want the credit of uploading, why would you mark it like that? 

In any case, I'd really appreciate it if you could upload 343. Thanks"

I too have uploaded a few to help out ""roadblocks"" in this collection of the past year or so.  Yes, they did come from eMule.  I don't think people care too much about where they come from, only that the continuity is maintained.  Thanks."
,soren.svenson,2013-04-28T12:51Z,Thank U
,An0nym0usPirate,2013-04-29T07:20Z,Wow this just came out today didn't it.  Thanks for the fast upload of it. 
,An0nym0usPirate,2013-04-29T19:32Z,I'm really looking forward to 345 Victoria's Sacred.  I hope someone finds it soon. 
,nuthatte,2013-05-01T20:41Z,Please please upload 343.
,rummybottle,2013-05-02T11:48Z,"@empsvbest: The point of filesharing is to SHARE. So if coflvtg is getting stuff from elsewhere and reuploading it here, well, that's a GOOD THING because that's the WHOLE POINT of TPB.

If you want credit for your uploads and for everyone to download from you, then don't upload anonymously. Upload under your username and before anyone else, and that way you will build up reputation so that everyone downloads from you."

I leave it to you to continue the series Fansadox, I leave you the pleasure to participate ..."
,empsvbest,2013-05-04T00:55Z,"You misunderstood me. I don't want anyone to stop uploading ORIGINAL content. @coflvtg, if you find a new comic and I haven't posted it, please post it. 

I don't want any credit to myself either. That's the reason why I made the uploads anonymous. 

I just didn't want pointless reuploads causing confusion and splitting seeders. This is a problem I ran into when I tried to download older comics, there are different downloads for the same thing and nobody has the whole file."
,ppqqstuff,2013-05-09T00:39Z,Thank you very much for sharing it. Does anyone have Fansadox 340 last mission 2? Want to get it badly.
