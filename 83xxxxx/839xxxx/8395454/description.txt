==== Encoding notes ====

The Cowboy Bebop Blu-ray footage come in four kinds:
- True 1080p film scan. The quality is excellent but shows a lot of grain.
  Fortunately, most parts of the series are made of these.
- Smooth 720p film scan. Less crisp than the 1080p scans, but still good.
  Shows a bit of noise reduction. Episode 3 is mostly made of these footage.
- Sharp 720p film scan. Grainy and much closer to the 1080p look than the
  smooth-720p sort, but shows terrible halos. Lot of them in episodes 14 or 24.
- Various forms of upscaled SD video. They show halos, noticeable aliasing
  (especially on the CG parts) and sometimes noise looking like dot crawl or
  color banding. Some parts seem to have been processed in a very ugly way
  (episode 23).

What we did:
- Interlaced video has been manually IVTCed and controlled in a semi-automated
  way.
- A few episodes contained 30p or 30i footage, we converted these parts to 30p
  and made the video VFR.
- Remaining interlacing artefacts and interlaced fades (ending) have been
  smoothed.
- Most grain has been filtered, but we kept it intact on delicate scenes.
- Aliasing has been smoothed and temporally stabilised to counter the horrible
  shimmering of CG animation.
- Halos have been masked.
- Color banding has been fixed.
- We detected a few badly composed pictures that we fixed.

What we could have done but did not:
- Cel stabilization. Footage were not shaky enough to justify this processing
  and the huge amount of work.
- Dust cleaning. The whole series was already quite clean, but some parts had
  more dust than others. Again, this is a lot of semi-automated work for a
  minor annoyance.
- Keeping the Japanese setero track.
- Blu-ray bonus.

Encoding source code attached to the episode 1, for encoders who wants to
create and release a “whole-grain” version without redoing the IVTC and SD
filtering from scratch.
