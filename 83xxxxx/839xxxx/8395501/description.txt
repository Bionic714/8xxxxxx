1971 This was the year of the Stewart-Tyrrell double-act
But it wasn t as clear-cut at the start of the season.
Ferrari was still team to beat, and the brute force of the V12 engine threatened to destroy everything in it Wake. It was the addition of Stewart and Tyrrell into the Championship that clallenged the balance of power, It made for na epic season that pitted mechanical muscle against driving skill.
