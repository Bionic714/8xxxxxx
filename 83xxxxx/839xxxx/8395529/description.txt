NOTES

Step into the sturdy boots of McJagger and take on an army of the
undead! In the standalone spin-off to All Zombies Must Die!, the
only thing that really matters is your score. Build your multiplier
and rack up as many kills as possible to become the best
zombie-slayer in Deadhill; to that end, your mission remains the
same: all zombies must die

As well infesting familiar locations such as Town Square, Shopping
Mall and Surburbia, the undead have ambled their way into all new
areas of Deadhill: the Military Base and Graveyard. In their bid to
turn the world into a race of shuffling corpses, the zombies have
stepped things up a gear for Scorepocalypse. McJagger will have to
take on three new flavours of the undead: Soldier, Necro and Ghost
Our stoic hero shouldn t be too concerned, however, there are two
new weapons to help send the shufflers packing: Mini-gun and Rocket
Launcher. Your score is based on a combination of two multipliers
one of which increases as you complete quests that appear
organically as you play, and the other based on how many
environmental modifiers you ve managed to apply to the undead. Use
fire, shock, sonic and radiation and the environments themselves
to your full advantage, and get the highest score possible!
