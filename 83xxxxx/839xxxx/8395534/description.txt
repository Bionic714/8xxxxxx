NOTES
Looks very nice for a cam. It's a bit bright, there's some camera
movement and occasionally the top of a chair or two is visible. 
There is one spot where video goes dark for a minute, but the audio is 
complete. Great sound quality for a cam. Thanks once again UnKnOwN !!

Greetz to everybody :)

Sample included. Enjoy!
