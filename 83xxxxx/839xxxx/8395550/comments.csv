WHAT THE STUPID AND IGNORANT PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE MOVIES THINK WE ARE?

The movie opens with US troops fighting Germans in Poland in 1944. There only Russians and Germans fought.

Also a black US soldier is wearing a brand new head band IN JAPANESE CHARACTERS, like from a dojo, can you imagine that? The other US soldiers would have killed him for that, the US being still at a brutal war against the japs....

An idiotic film for idiots who will swallow ANYTHING.
