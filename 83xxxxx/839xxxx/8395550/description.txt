Buckle up for an action-packed thrill ride with The Chaplain,
The Sniper and Black Hercules. It's Poland, 1944. Called up
by FDR to carry out a top-secret rescue mission, a daring
team of Special Forces soldiers quickly find themselves
trapped deep behind enemy lines. With no evacuation and no
escape options, the furious bastards are forced to cooperate
and utilize their unique talents to battle super-soldier
Nazis, save some local virgins, and storm a remote occult
Nazi science lab to literally stop Hell from boiling over.
If it's going to take guts, split second timing, and a million
bullets... it's a job for the Devils of War!
