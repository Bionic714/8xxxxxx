This is the first book to give such close attention to Le Corbusier's approach to the making of buildings. It illustrates the ways in which Le Corbusier's details were expressive of his overall philosophical intentions. It is not a construction book in the usual sense- rather it focusses on the meaning of detail, on the ways in which detail informs the overall architectural narrative of a building. Well illustrated and containing several specially prepared scaled drawings it acts as timely reminder to both students and architects of the possibilities inherent in the most small scale tectonic gestures. 

* Lavishly illustrated, with numerous in depth studies this book will be an inspiration to both students and architects
* This is the first book to illustrate Le Corbusier's philosophies through his use of detail 
* So innovative was Le Corbusier's approach to design and so influential has he been on the current generation of architects that his work remains as relevant today as it ever did
