,daldan9626,2013-04-21T17:31Z,Thanks man
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T17:39Z,"@famemon78 I don't undrstand. They're 23 seeders for Weekend and 11 for Forgiveness. None of them are seeding! If they don't seed, then I'll re-upload them again"
,filthy3825,2013-04-21T17:52Z,"have you had any luck finding ""the baytown outlaws"" and ""a little bit zombie""? incidentally, i know that you are busy, but should i be in the lookout for ""dogma""?"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T18:32Z,@famemon78 I have RELOADED Weekend. Here's the link http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8395756/Weekend_%28Criterion%29_DVD-R_R1_NTSC_SteelerJ17_%28RELOADED%29
,daldan9626,2013-04-21T18:38Z,Do you happen to have All Things Fall Apart?
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T19:15Z,@daldan9626 Yes I do! 
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T19:24Z,@daldan9626 Yes I do!
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-21T22:47Z,@filthy3825 I should have Dogma this week. A Little Bit Zombie comes out on DVD in July. I have special ordered The Baytown Outlaws through interlibrary loan. Hopefully I can get it. 
,filthy3825,2013-04-23T16:25Z,"my apologies. i thought that ""a little bit zombie"" was out. did they say when they could get ""the baytown outlaws""?"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-24T00:03Z,@filthy3825 Nothing yet. I'll let you know
,filthy3825,2013-04-24T16:49Z,okay. thank you.
