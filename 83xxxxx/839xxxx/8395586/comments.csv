,Thanosb18c,2013-04-21T17:26Z,I cant thank you enough IAMH67...oNLY 1 question....What happened with the SkySport coverage..?
,IAMH67,2013-04-21T17:33Z,"@Thanosb18c

Sky Sports are sending DMCA's and removing Sky boxes of cappers (people who record this i.e Hannibal) so the recorders have switched to BBC. 

The sky coverage will be uploaded by others but it will be uploaded late because of this and you will see BBC from now on more frequently on every torrent site. 

I myself record and upload Sky when I can but couldn't do it today so this is the fastest Torrent I could get."
,shroud777,2013-04-21T17:48Z,"just wanted to say thank you for uploading the race, just wanted to know why there are no connections "
,Thanosb18c,2013-04-21T18:03Z,"@IAMH67

,elmonster1,2013-04-21T18:18Z,"thanks a million m8

,Thanosb18c,2013-04-21T18:31Z,people if you dont start seeding none of us  is gonna be able to watch this race. So leave your stubbornness and arrogance on the side and lets make this easier we all want to see this race and not be stuck here for the rest of our lifes...Thank u
,digimike50,2013-04-21T18:53Z,Great stuff and thanks for your concern about getting us a copy ASAP. Cheers ...
,GHOSTWG,2013-04-21T19:01Z,"Please seed people, at least for the next hour or two while you're watching the race and don't need internet. There's a lot of us waiting to watch it, and the download rates are very sporadic. Thanks! "
,GHOSTWG,2013-04-21T19:07Z,And upload while you download please!
,ceebeenor,2013-04-21T19:23Z,"this would be faster if a acctually started walking to your house now...

seed! "
,serious67,2013-04-21T19:34Z,"Hmm.. I thought F1 fans were less selfish, but obviously 10 times more leechers than seeders prove me wrong. Slowest download ever....."
,questar,2013-04-21T20:12Z,"Don't pay any attention to the Seeders number. TPB spoofs that number during the initial stages of a torrent to make it more difficult for copyright owners to identify seeders.

The reason this torrent started out slowly is that the initial seeder, IAMH67, seeded slowly, perhaps to the limit of his Internet connection. Now some other seeders with Hannibal's source have joined in so things should speed up."
,v3ngence,2013-04-21T20:29Z,"HOLY SHITTY TORRENT BATMAN!!!

Why is dl speed under 100kB/s that's just disgraceful..."
,nextmanche,2013-04-21T20:48Z,"sky coverage including pre-race, race and post-race is here https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8395847/F1.20130421.Bahrain.Race.SD.mp4 

 Please seed"
,IAMH67,2013-04-21T21:22Z,"User above me [questar] is right. The seeders and leechers are spoofed for security purposes.


You guys are having a problem because this torrent currently has 6,000+ downloaders and only 400 something seeders. The file has already been seeded twice by me but too many people are downloading this race and it will take some time for all of them to get this. 

This is currently the 2nd most downloaded TV-Torrent on thepiratebay so just seed as best as you can when you are done even if it takes long to download. I myself also seed these for weeks.

Sorry if you get low speeds, it is down to luck who gets a connection with a seeder. If you sort the peers by ""Peer DL"" you will see that some people are getting 2 MBPS while others are getting just 100kbps. 

When thepiratebay Seeder and Leecher numbers will refresh in an hour there will be 1,000 - 2,000 seeds. "

,SayGen102,2013-04-21T23:32Z,"no 720p? Watching with 25 fps is a bit of a killjoy. Hard to really get into the race, not ur fualt ULer. But if there is a better quality one would someone let me know."
,pxpierre,2013-04-22T06:23Z,"Thank you IAMH67 & seeders!

Very good quality considering the file size.

Fun to watch race, pretty exciting until the end."
