V - Very good for a HDRip. Looks like a average DVDscreener.

M - Crap. I have nothing against action movies but the action scenes needs to be choreographed and/or at least make any sense. This is just ugly and over the top retarded.
Although Genesis Rodriguez is insanely hot to look at. Unfortunately she obviously didn't preform that well on the casting couch as she is barely in it. "

not everyone out there have functional hearing, some people actually can't hear anything what so ever and needs SUBS

,mrknowitawl,2013-04-24T15:07Z,"Can a movie get any worse? I mean seriously WTF? Schwarzenegger and Whitaker should be ashamed of themselves to be in a poorly written and directed movie.

,libertaswv,2013-04-25T04:13Z,"The subtitle thing was just stupid. mrwolf hit some of many reasons for them, and the rest should be as obvious as those. 

Weird assumption about the use of subs, and equally stupid/weird reaction if the reason WERE because they didn't speak english. 

Wtf? You condemn everyone not born in an english speaking country?? lol.. Bizarre and sad.

Thanks again to .BONE. and all seeders and leechers - Sincerely appreciated"
,ajoiner85,2013-04-25T04:29Z,"When I watched Pans Labyrinth, I didnt feel the slightest bit of guilt for not having been in the process of learning Spanish. I just watched the subtitles, and amazingly didnt feel subhuman for doing so.
English is not like the best language anyways. It's not gutteral sounding, but it is nasally sounding. It's also a little overkill on the vocalized ""th"" sounds (like in the words father or weather), the w's, not to mention the archaic word construction and grammar. The only reason so many people speak it is because the British metastasized over the globe like a cancer. Britons don't bath frequently. They dont believe in dentistry. They invented the concentration camp, and have committed the most efficient genocides on the planet. Their food is terrible, as is their clime. Every single nation has kicked them out (except Canada pffffft)."

YOU are the most ignorant (possibly racist), and most spiteful person I have seen on here in a while. You somehow feel that the entire world should learn english?? Is that what yo mean? How many other languages do you know? I would guess NONE. Despite your ignorant comment, Just to let you know that FUCKING ENGLISH is not the most wildly spoken language on the planet by a long shot. . ."
,dlarrym1111,2013-04-27T02:07Z,"
To add, @Phatfish. . .
PineappleStarz makes a VERY VERY NICE AND HELPFUL COMMENT, explaining a very easy way to help someone else get subtitles, and then you feel the need to chime in with a comment that comes from nowhere but HATE inside your soulless husk of a body. I hope you need help one day, something more serious then subtitles, something like help getting out of a burning building and you get told to learn how to FIGHT A FUCKING FIRE ASSHOLE.
What would happen if that actually occured to you. . . GOD would only smile!

,ajoiner85,2013-05-04T18:07Z,"@Rob93
Oh NO!! Mispelled words!! Oh dear!!!
When I say, ""U R a DUMMI"", is the meaning lost on account of the words being misspelled? The purpose of the words is to communicate. If it does that with ""misspelled"" words than it doesn't fail at its purpose. The ""official spelling"" of words doesn't have any real grounding authority, not to mention it changes. If we were using English in an earlier rendition than 9/10s of the words here would be spelled in an archaic fashion. If it can change over time then, then why not now? Who decides? Sounds just like your kissing the ass of bloated and anachronistic traditions."
,ajoiner85,2013-05-04T18:13Z,"No comment here, or on any page here, has to relate to the torrent at hand. You can feel free to comment on WHATEVR you want. I dont believe in using the second e in whatever, i think its redundant. And I also dont use apostrophes in contractions. Im convinced that if you are going to the length to contract a word, why add in a mark to indicate your contraction??? You might as well not even contract it if your just going to replace the contracted character with another!!! DUMB."

Good quality.  I feel like I've seen this movie about 10 other times just with 10 other different names.  Cliche action flick with the same story progression as about a thousand other movies.  This formula worked in the 80's but back then it was cool.  Now it's just the same old shit over and over.  At least there's no cheesy love story element mixed in or I would have rated it even lower."
