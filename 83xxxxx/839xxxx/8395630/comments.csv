,jammerking,2013-04-22T00:25Z,"Thank you for the upload. Missing the opening credits+ camera movements. Tin can sound fast motion blurry. Obviously some will find this watchable and others like myself will not. 

Missing starting credits actually over 6 minutes at the start and the rest at the end.

imdb shows 128 min this one 117 min 
Cam rating 
A 5 tinny V5 

DVDrip rating A2 V2"
