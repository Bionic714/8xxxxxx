Deconstruction is aligned with the marginalized, as even its critics acknowledge, but the ethical basis for the alliance has been misunderstood. How can deconstruction invoke "what should be" when the question requires an appeal to some criteria of justice. The purpose of this volume is to rethink the relation of Jacques Derrida's writings and his unique philosophical positioning to questions of law, justice and legal interpretation, without reference to the catch phrases that have supposedly captured deconstruction in a nutshell.

Beginning with Derrida's groundbreaking essay, "Force of Law: The Mystical Foundation of Authority", the book's distinguished contributors include David Gray Carlson, Drucilla Cornell, Fred Dallmayr, Henry Louis Gates, Agnes Heller, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Arthur J. Jacobson, Michel Rosenfeld, J. Hillis Miller, Rene Schurmann, Samuel Weber, Alan Wolfe, and Charles W. Yablon.
