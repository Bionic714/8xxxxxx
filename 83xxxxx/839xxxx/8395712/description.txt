Renee Evans has a knack for 

trouble. After walking in on her best friend and boyfriend 

in bed together, twenty-five year-old Renee flees sunny Los 

Angeles and her dream job as a music journalist and returns 

to her hometown of Boston ΓÇô only to meet Dylan Cavallari, 

the mysterious, aspiring musician who lives in her 

apartment building. DylanΓÇÖs piercing gaze and womanizing 

demeanor make him exactly the type of guy that Renee should 

steer clear of ΓÇô which is most likely the reason she falls 

for him. But when ReneeΓÇÖs troublesome ex comes back and 

threatens to drive her and Dylan apart, Renee is forced to 

face her past and save her relationship with Dylan before 

it's too late.


Sound Bites dramatizes what happens when Renee finds 

herself caught between a painful past and an uncertain 

future. Happiness turns out to be within her grasp, but it 

all depends on whether she can trust herself enough to make 

the right decisions. Sound Bites is a novel about love, 

friendship, betrayal, forgiveness, and the power of music 

to help you find your way.
