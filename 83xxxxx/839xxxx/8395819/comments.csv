,MonteCarloDos,2013-04-25T11:43Z,already installed this and cannot seem to play episode 3 without that unlocker. I'm using RG Revenant's version of AC3.

you dont need unlocker,you need crack from update 1.05"

1. run the updater.
2. when the install wizard pops up, minimize it then go to start(lower left windows logo) and search for %temp%
4. when the window pops up, search for a folder that has a bracket and numbers on it (e.g: {B6409C5E-1DC1-4930-BEF2-F1372D7647EA})

5. open it, if there's a folder called disk1 then that's the right folder.

6. go to disk1/deltafiles/ and delete the folder named multi

7. go to the install wizard and click next.

8. you're good"
,Dunge,2013-05-21T00:02Z,"I hope someone can help me. I played through the game with the Reloaded version, then installed update 1 to 5 and DLC 1 to 3 all from Reloaded. I tried both the crack from 1.05 and the one from this dlc package and none work. When I select the DLC menu option it say it can't connect to Ubisoft servers. I can still see and play my normal savegame though.

Is this a firewall/connectivity/offline issue? Is this an uPlay issue?"
,Dunge,2013-05-21T00:21Z,"If anyone else is in my position, I don't know why but adding the savegame from the Unlocker.Only-P2P torrent worked."
,magyargamer,2013-06-01T22:07Z,"I am the original ACIII, can I make this work, with that or should I download a cracked version?"
