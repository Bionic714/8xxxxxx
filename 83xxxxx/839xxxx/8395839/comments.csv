,mosh1111,2013-04-21T19:57Z,my F1 shot is sorted thanks to u mate
,JFever,2013-04-21T22:27Z,"Amazing upload! 
I live in Canada so F1 coverage is horrible. I can only watch the race itself. No pre race show. No post race show. If there was any way you could split up the file next time for people like me, it would be greatly appreciated. I would gladly pay for this broadcast if I only had the option. I will seed the crap out of this. Thanks so much for making it possible to watch my favorite sport the way it should be seen."
,pxpierre,2013-04-22T00:36Z,"@ smcgill1969: for the next time, could you specify if it is Sky or BBC coverage in the description and split the torrent in 3 files: pre-race, race & post-race.

One reason is to be able to download only pre-race for example & while watching it, enable Race dl. Thanks!"

Read the Tag; ""SKYF1HD"""
,keif8,2013-04-22T02:59Z,"Many thanks for uploading this.  There's currently no  others with pre and post race coverage and in HD.

But the video is kinda weird looking though.  Almost like it has that ""soap opera"" effect."
,DaMoose74,2013-04-22T04:55Z,Ditto on JFevers's comment. Many thanx from Canada! :)
,55trucker,2013-04-22T21:21Z,"Thx for the effort,
