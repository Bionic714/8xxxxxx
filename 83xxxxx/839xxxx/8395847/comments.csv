,nextmanche,2013-04-21T20:45Z,"Thanks a million. I beg of you, please add formula 1 to your f1 torrent names so other people can search  this and add to seeders. Thanks again"
,Abawcom,2013-04-21T21:56Z,Thank you FINALLY a dload with the pre Show
,Viciously,2013-04-21T22:34Z,"Thanks.

BTW, I guess I missed the real thing. MKVToolNIX doesn't encode!. It's super fast!. "

,pxpierre,2013-04-22T00:35Z,"@ smcgill1969: for the next time, could you specify if it is Sky or BBC coverage in the description and split the torrent in 3 files: pre-race, race & post-race.

One reason is to be able to download only pre-race for example & while watching it, enable Race dl. Thanks!"

,ndtoronto,2013-04-22T02:54Z,Seed Please!!!!!!
,giffo5,2013-04-22T04:11Z,Thank you sooooo much man !!! 
,jb4thewin,2013-04-22T04:35Z,"yup, agree. 3 parts is always good. Good for downloading and other reasons - I couldn't watch the post race show live today cause I had to leave the house... and you know, this is your choice of course but naming your torrents Formula 1 instead of F1.2013 would lead people to these much quicker. 

But as always, much appreciated, thanks for the race!"
,Viciously,2013-04-23T00:42Z,"1: Look at tags. It's clearly written Sky. 

2: WTF is the problem with the name?. How hard is it to write ""F1"" and click search?.

3:@smc, dude, aspect ratio was fucked again. :|

... next race is 3 damn weeks later so I hope you take like 1 hour of your time out to fix the aspect ratio and try MKVToolNIX.

BTW, aspect ratio should be 640×360."
