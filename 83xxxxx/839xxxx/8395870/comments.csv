,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-22T12:38Z,"Love you froog, but to hell with Carnegie and his school privatizing spawn.

I still haven't got over this. Quite incredible!!!"
,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-22T15:50Z,"yup,

us regular folk sure do have a lot to contest with."
,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-22T16:43Z,"I know you're probably scared right now.

A rich boy like you has nothing to be frightened of!!!!

You have got the world in the palm of your hand!!!

No need to fake it with the photos.

You really had me going there.

All I can say is I AM GLAD IT WAS ME WHO PICKED YOU OUT."
,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-22T16:47Z,I can help you to be less of a worthless piece of shit!!! This is so exciting for a little person like me!!!
,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-26T09:49Z,"For the love of, I would say God, but I'm not big on that guy... for the love of little people everywhere, I didn't mean it froogAL. I was a bit sauced up and Dale Carnegie's name (which I got confused with the Guggenhiem kid) had me seeing the red mist. Anyhow, This will be svidrigailovjones's last comment, as he no longer deserves to exist."
,froogAL,2013-05-03T23:10Z,"Don't fret man...we're in it for the music.
My Carnegie comment simply meant that I 
borrowed the CD from the library.  I've been looking for my copy of complete Aladdin Sonny Stitt for you but that sucker's vanished.  Keep uploading......fA"
,hoppyharrington,2013-05-10T09:40Z,"What do you mean vanished.

VANISHED???"
,hoppyharrington,2013-05-10T09:42Z,What I mean is hoppyharrington wonders how such reordings could simply vanish.
,froogAL,2013-05-14T07:57Z,It's a double CD which I remember vividly and more important; audibly.  Alphabetical organization run amok.  Did I trade it for Franz Lizst? I dunno
