This LP was recorded in Paris during the same Fall season of 1958

which yielded the Jazz Messengers "MOANIN'" LP which I've referred to 

recently.  The "horn section" at that time consisted of Benny Golson 

and Lee Morgan.


Try to consider this a Messengers album without Art Blakey (I know

how stupid that sounds) 


TRACK #6 is a total GEM......THURSDAY'S THEME


5 Golson penned tunes to be found herein including 2 takes of

STABLEMATES



Thank Andrew Carnegie for this one... folks
