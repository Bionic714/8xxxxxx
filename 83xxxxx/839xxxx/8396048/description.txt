Jason Vorhees(Kane Hodder) the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling. Tracked down and blown to bits by a special FBI task force, everyone now assumes that he's finally dead. But everyone assumes wrong. Jason has been reborn with the bone chilling ability to assume the identity of anyone he touches. The terrifying truth is he could be anywhere. Or anybody.
