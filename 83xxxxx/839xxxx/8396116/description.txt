Jeff Beck
B.B. King Blues Club & Grill
New York, NY

The Collector's Edition

Original recording remastered and released in 2011

Whenever Jeff Beck performs in a rare intimate concert setting, it's always an event. For this special occasion at the B.B. King Blues Club in New York City, the audience was treated the reunion of the Guitar Shop power trio of Jeff Beck, Terry Bozzio and Tony Hymas. This brilliant guitar shredder truly threw down some of his classiest and hard driving repertoire ever as it was captured originally for a rare online release in 2003.
