This is a DVD that comes with a 140 page illustrated hard bound book called Stargate SG-1 The Ultimate Visual Guide. Since I did not scan the book into a PDF file I am not going to talk about it. (The book does not include the final season 10 anywayΓÇª) 
However the DVD that came with it is a.. ΓÇ£..DVD featuring mini-documentaries from cast members and an interactive trivia quiz that starts off easy but then proceeds to test your knowledge of SG1... and appropriately enough there is also a gallery of artwork from the show, too.ΓÇ¥ - Susan Griffiths (http://www.concatenation.org/nfrev/stargatevisualgd.html) 
It is just some (small) bells and whistles that gives you a different view on the show. We do remember it is just a show, right?
