It's a common problem with torrented videos. I've heard that uploading your video players codecs could help but I simply found another video player. Mine's called MPlayerX but as far as I know, it's only for MacOS. I'm not sure which ones would work for PC (I'm assuming u have one) but if you look around, I'm sure you'll find one. Hope this helps.
PS: It might be hard to find but don't give up. I had to go through at least TEN different video players before I found the right one."
