,jamesdk09,2013-04-22T03:50Z,thanx alot for the second season
,jamesb381,2013-04-22T05:40Z,Been seaching for this for almost 2 years.  Even tried buying DVD in several places.  Thanks a million for the upload.  Why this show is not more readily available is a mystery.  Would be extremely popular in the South and Southwestern USA.  Have not heard of MOCCASIN FLATS but will now be searching for it.  Hope you have luck finding it also.
,jamesb381,2013-04-22T06:19Z,"Tried finding MOCCASIN FLATS on the web with no luck.  So I ordered the 3 season box set  from www.bigsoul.net.  For making season 2 of BLACKSTONE available, when I could find it nowhere else, I would be pleased to send you a copy of the boxset for free if you're still interested.  If so, e-mail me at jamesb381@aol.com.  Again, THANKS for the Blackstone downloads.....................JIM"
