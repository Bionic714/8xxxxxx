,masething,2013-04-24T05:53Z,Thanks. It was missing from the original DEiMOS pack I downloaded last year
,masething,2013-04-24T05:58Z,Actually I was wrong. It was episode 55 that was missing. The end of his pack is all messed up from proper ordering
,MerolaC2029,2013-04-24T06:28Z,"You mean mine or the one you downloaded?
I didn't changed the order of the files, they are original from DEiMOS pack. (And I think from the DVD's too.)"
