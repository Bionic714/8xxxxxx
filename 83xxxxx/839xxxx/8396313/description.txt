 Everyone's dancing and making merry in        
 the Khullar household, especially Tej         
 who is all set to gift would-be son-in-law    
 Raj and daughter Tanvi a brand new Maruti     
 Ertiga gaddi on their wedding day. While      
 the wedding preparations are in full swing,   
 Tej's son Sameer is the daft guy who aspires  
 to woo the hot 'Shakira of Chandigarh'        
 Jazzleen. She calls him 'psychic' (thinking   
 it's the same as 'psycho') and he tells her,  
 'I am love you'. In order to patau the pataka,
 Sameer uses the new car and ends up losing it!
 The car goes missing, thus forcing Sameer and 
 his best friend Gattu to form a complex web   
 of lies to save Sameer from the wrath of      
 his father.
