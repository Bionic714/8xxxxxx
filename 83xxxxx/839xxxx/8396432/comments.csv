V8"
,Pdid,2013-04-22T05:29Z,"For a cam it's exceptionally watchable. Sound tinny but serves its purpose. Agree with video 8, sound 5. Gory movie, but enjoyable. Should be seven more mins according to IMDB."
,Pdid,2013-04-22T06:10Z,Amending rating; focus issues in second half and dark scenes rough. Solid 5/5 A/V
,K1bbler,2013-04-22T10:06Z,The review on imdb for this movie was garbage. The nerd was clearly butthurt they remade a cult classic. It's a different film get over it.
,p1zL3,2013-04-23T04:52Z,"Yeah... read the NFO; this is just 40min of a semi-stable cam by THC and when the cameraman bitches-out, they spliced in FOX's release (subs, blur, and all).... pretty weak attempt.

A/3
V/3~5

,pennknig,2013-04-29T15:09Z,"IMDB reports:
This movie is  91 Min (1Hr 31 Min).
This release is 84 Min (1Hr 24Min).
What is the 7 missing Minuets? The credits? Movie Content? "

,Nejumin,2013-05-07T06:07Z,"@djmixmode No if they catch you filming they call the cops, because its a felony offense which could lead to prison time, or a quarter of a million dollar fine."
