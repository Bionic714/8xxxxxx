What other races do you have capped that you haven't uploaded? Where else do you upload or download?

Do you by any chance have any invites available for members only sites? I have a seed box going currently and would like to use it to it's fullest extent!

Heep up the great work!"
,SwedishMeatball,2013-04-22T15:41Z,"PS folks.....

I use the snub ban and kick features on my seedbox. If you are not UPLOADING, I snub you.....

So....

Open up your upload rates and SEED, SEED, SEED!"
,SwedishMeatball,2013-04-22T15:49Z,and I mean if you are not downloading by at least 50kbs I will kick you off my seedbox!
