They Wanted A Normal Life In Suburbia! Gina (Ela Darling) and Annie Marks (Daisy Layne) are a long term lesbian couple with a 2008 vintage marriage, a cute house, good jobs... and a sex life that is a thing of the past. Annie starts having an affair with her 19 year old assistant (Pepper Kester) while acting even more distant at home. When Gina finds a red thong in Annie's clothes, she is both conflicted about her feelings. She catches her neighbor, Riley (Lily Cade) making out with a chick who isn't Riley's fiance, which prompts her to explain her troubles to Riley. Meanwhile, Annie is breaking up with Pepper because she loves her wife. Things come to a head when Annie comes home to apologize and Gina meets her at the door, dressed in her wedding lingerie, and demands that she call her lover and make her come over. Annie thinks it's drama Gina wants, but it's not, it's a threesome!
