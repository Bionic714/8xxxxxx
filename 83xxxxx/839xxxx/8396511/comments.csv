,SilentR,2013-04-22T03:32Z,"A last note to all Simmers over there:

The crack found in this Torrent is a Update-friendly crack. This means, that the Sims 3 Game Launcher can download any Update Patches and install them to your game if you want! And without messing up your game!

It is like as if you have a legal copy of the Sims 3.


But, personally, if you liked and enjoyed the game, But you or your family haven't gotten a legal copy of the game yet, please leave this torrent and go purchase it! Support the company for making games for you.

I will keep seeding 7/24. Have nice Simming!"

I'm downloading one with everything and that is only ~30 gigs. "
,SilentR,2013-04-24T20:27Z,"@ JohnWu:

Your torrent must be missing either the Stuff Packs either the Expansion Packs. Also it is possible that it uses 7-z compression type.

Given that all the Expansions together are about 35-45 GB in total, and all the Stuff Packs are about 15-25 GB total, your torrent must be missing either some files, either build differently.

The torrent I post here, gives you a Sims 3 game that is 100% friendly to any future updates/game patches, and allows you to sign in with the Game Launcher and enjoy all online features (such as the store, content sharing, SimPort, etc, without any penalties for your account (if you have any).

Enjoy!"
,SilentR,2013-04-24T21:02Z,"In case someone here is wondering, the Sims 3 Game Launcher is absolutely safe to use, and can connect online with the www.Sims3.com and the Store. All online in-game features such as the SimPort, the Store, the Messaging, etc, work perfectly in the game.

This crack is the same crack available on other torrents that replaces 2 files in Sims 3 Bin folder: TS3W.exe and TSLHost.dll that completely disable the game's anti-piracy protection.

I think it's a huge mistake. Y don't u put it non archived folders, it's a torrent not a direct download. U need like 120+GB to extract it. "
,SilentR,2013-05-06T18:51Z,"@ SlayeRAIN:

Yeah, thats true. I apologize for the mistake. It is my very first torrent I ever uploaded and didn't realized that sooner. Next time I will bear this in mind as I could like to give the torrent community more flexibility on picking up what they want to download/extract rather than being forced to download/extract it as whole.

If I ever make a new torrent, I will bear this in mind."
,SilentR,2013-05-06T18:53Z,"Strange but the whole archive zip-pressed is 60GB, while unpressed is only 5GB more (65GB total).

If you already tried instructions but cracks are failing, then no worries. Good news for you. Your game its just fine - all what you have to do its very simple: get updated cracks. 
So in this case, I highly recommend you check on internet for newer versions of those cracks. The newer and latest versions of Sims 3 cracks shouldn't have any problems at all!
If I list you some Cracking sites, The Pirate Bay will censor my post, and so you will have to ask in forums, friends or you can simply find them yourself by googling. :)"

,kyogreceasar,2013-05-25T11:54Z,still not working so i'll just wait for island paradise
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-25T11:58Z,but 1 last question do i have to install the previous cracks for expansions or only university life crack?
,SilentR,2013-05-25T20:54Z,"@ kyogreceasar:
Only University Life. Because only one crack can be installed at a time, in the following directory:

Program Files, Electronic Arts, The Sims 3, Game, Bin

I wonder, your operation system is Windows or Mac? The Cracks do NOT work on Mac computers. Work only on Windows computers"
,SilentR,2013-05-25T20:56Z,"@ kyogreceasar:

Lets say that you installed the crack in the Bin folder of the Sims 3, ok?

If you did so, have you tried to run the game using the TS3W.exe?  (this exe is found in that Bin folder where you place the Crack)"
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T00:05Z,of course i did i always did but wait did u said INSTALLED ? or just copy paste it?
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T00:06Z,and i said that i have windows xp
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T00:07Z,i click on TS3W.exe and then a black screen opens (like sims launcher 'play' does and then error
,SilentR,2013-05-26T01:25Z,"@ kyogreceasar:

You never told me what this error writes.
Write it down, please. So I can understand if your problem is related to my torrent or its just your game."
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T12:39Z,it says something about start failed error 0x024e424f
,SilentR,2013-05-26T13:35Z,"@ kyogreceasar:

Apparently you was wasting your time here.
This is a game error, has nothing to do with my torrent. If you want solution, you need contact EA, or read this faq EA made for the Sims 3 players who get that error:

http://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-3/FAQ-Service-initialization-failed/td-p/65394

I can't help you. Sorry. This is a gane developer's problem, not a torrent's problem."
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T14:31Z,i have already tried these before u ... but why this is still not working
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T14:35Z,1 last question if i'll buy island paradise then can i download origin and make launcher updates?
,kyogreceasar,2013-05-26T21:30Z,and some forum infos says that this kind of error needs game updates (where?) and updated cracks i am searching
,SilentR,2013-05-26T23:53Z,"@ kyogreceasar:
If you install legal copy of Island Paradise, you will no longer need the cracks, logically. But I can't confirm this theory as I haven't tried it personally. So do it in your own risk.

Game Updates come via the Sims 3 Launcher. Go to the Launcher and ask it to check for new updates."
