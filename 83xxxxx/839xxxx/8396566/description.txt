
Betty Krawczyk's characteristic sharpness of wit and evocative Southern-based turn of phrase make THIS DANGEROUS PLACE an immense pleasure to read. And like any cherished moment, the book is a delight to recall after inhaling its last pages. Krawczyk's personal, idiosyncratic story transcends the particularities of time and space and takes you to a deeper place within yourself, a place
of new possibilities.
