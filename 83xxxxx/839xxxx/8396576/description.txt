Amazon User Review by Josh P.
Atlantic Records was one of the country's leading record companies in rhythm & blues and soul music. Here, in collaboration with Rhino Records, 16 rare tunes are presented froim artists like Wilson Pickett, Sam & Dave, Otis Redding, Percy Sledge, Donny Hathaway, Arthur Conley, plus some rarely heard artists as well. Some of these songs have never made it past being only released on the original 45, and others have never been heard before, period. These songs come from about 1967-1974; one of the last of the golden ages at Atlantic. This disc runs about 50 minutes, but is very enjoyable. Definitely worth hearing, because it's not something you'd hear every day. One listen to the whole thing, and you'd be asking why some of these songs never saw the light of day again...until now!
