Evangel, born and raised in the Bronx, NY moved to Maryland in 1989. He and his wife have two sons.  Once an aspiring secular hip hop artist by the name of Alcatraz, he sought to bring consciousness to the hip hop community through his music with positive messages.  In 1994, his positive message was challenged by the message of the gospel of Christ!  The Lord saved him and completely changed his message!
