Halo: The Thursday War, the riveting new space thriller sequel to Karen Traviss' New York Times bestseller Halo: Glasslands, is based on the enormously popular game.
Welcome to humanityΓÇÖs new war: silent, high stakes, and unseen. This is a life-or-death mission for ONIΓÇÖs black-ops team, Kilo-Five, which is tasked with preventing the ruthless Elites, once the military leaders of the Covenant, from regrouping and threatening humankind again. What began as a routine dirty-tricks operationΓÇòkeeping the Elites busy with their own insurrectionΓÇòturns into a desperate bid to extract one member of Kilo-Five from the seething heart of an alien civil war. 
But troubles never come singly for Kilo-Five. Colonial terrorism is once again surfacing on one of the worlds that survived the war against the Covenant, and the man behind it is much more than just a name to Spartan-010. Meanwhile, the treasure trove of Forerunner technology recovered from the shield world of Onyx is being put to work while a kidnapped Elite plots vengeance on the humans he fears will bring his people to the brink of destruction.
