All these songs were done around the same time. I think I am getting better, but I haven't done anything new. It takes a lot out of me. It is hard to have the confidence and the memory to know if they suk. I enjoy posting them. I have never had feedback and to see ten or twenty down loaders a day is nice. I am not trying to be professional, although I feel I should wait before posting anything until I can accompany myself. I have a friend teaching me the chords for sitting on the dock of the bay. If you want something professional this is not it. But if you want to watch someone get back on their feet again then you may be interested in these. I do not remember my childhood. I was hurt severely and I am only slowly remembering how much I loved music. When you DL these I see the number of peers in my utorrent while seeding. It is nice to see.
