"Lacey"

Mr. Gold enlists the aid of David to help him 
try to jog Belle's now cursed memories and get 
her to love him again; and when it is revealed 
that the magic beans Anton and the dwarves have 
been harvesting have begun to grow and could 
possibly transport everybody home, Emma is torn 
over whether she would want to live in fairytale 
land or stay in our world. Meanwhile, in the 
fairytale land that was, Rumplestiltskin forces 
Belle to accompany him on a hunt to kill a 
thief, whom she had freed in the name of mercy.
