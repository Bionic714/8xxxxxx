Rambo First Blood by David Morrell (Unabridged) performed by Eric G. Dove

First Blood is a 1972 novel. It was adapted into the 1982 film starring Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo.

John Rambo, a Vietnam War veteran, is hitchhiking in Madison, Kentucky and is picked up by Sheriff Teasle and dropped off at the city limits. When Rambo repeatedly returns, Teasle finally arrests him and drives him to the station. He is charged with vagrancy and resisting arrest and is sentenced to 35 days in jail. Being trapped inside the cold, wet, small cells gives Rambo a flashback of his days as a POW in Vietnam, and he fights off the cops as they attempt to cut his hair and shave him without shaving cream, beating one man and slashing another with the straight razor. He flees, steals a motorcycle, and hides in the nearby mountains. He becomes the focus of a manhunt that results in the deaths of many police officers, civilians, and National Guardsmen.
