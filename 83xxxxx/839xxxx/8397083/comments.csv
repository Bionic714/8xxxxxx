If I may, I will have another suggestion. There in no HD torrent of reasonable size of movie Nixon (1995) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113987/ 
If you could encode that movie, it will be great."
,jalucian,2013-04-25T17:56Z,"Could only find a 720p source for Nixon, but I'll put it in line for encoding. Might take a week or so as there are several ahead of you. All I ask is that if I do a request, please do your best to help keep it seeded - preferably for a couple of weeks at least, or as much as you can."
,jalucian,2013-05-04T01:39Z,"Nixon, as requested, extended version, with both director's commentary tracks added as well:
