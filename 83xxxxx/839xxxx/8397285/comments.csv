,thankyoutoall,2013-04-22T06:30Z,i have a question.  I am a noob. What do people gain by uploading here?  I noticed a few people upload the same thing and try to be first also. Can someone tell me why?
,ScarletteSpider,2013-04-22T09:46Z,"thankyoutoall...I'd be happy to answer ur question since no one else has yet. Take it from a veteran torrent user, these are just some (not all) the reasons why there is more than one torrent for the same thing. And I'm gonna give good, solid, sound and honest advice how to avoid the potholes of torrenting.


First, there are more than one posting for each thing you may be looking for. This is particularly true with tv shows. There are literally people from all over the world that use this site. What may be a trusted uploader in one country may have availability issues, or no one in the regional clusters of seeders in their part of the world. Not all uploaders are created equal for quality, realiability and available seeders. But I can tell you that ones such as EZTV, ETTV, HDNation, etc always have high quality, virus free files. They get them up fast because folks like me and others volunteer for their teams to get the files first and seed them out because we have the speed and bandwidth to spare.


Secondly, some ppl will put up the files faster than others, some even the day or days before. Be wary of these uploaders because usually (not always but more often than not) these are internet marketers that seed you a file u get all excited about having so quickly, only to find out first its zipped, then when decompressed it says you need a password from another site. You get there and then you have to fill out surveys and purchase at least one product to get the password to unlock the file. NEVER do that! You should never have to reveal real life info about yourself or make a purchase to get a torrent. They will take your name, phone number, credit/debit card number and sell it on a list back to your internet provider to give to networks/movie studios to nail you for copyright intellectual property infringement. The folks that provide the torrent files here own them and it is not illegal for them to share their property with as many other people as they wish. And the entertainment industry knows this, they don't like it, but sharing is not theft. They want a bigger piece of a profit pie? then they need to make them available directly via the internet without having to disclose personal information AND commercial free. 


Last but not least, I strongly recommend you get a IP masking service, so your internet provider doesn't start sending you letters/emails about your torrent activity and needlessly scaring the crapola outta you. They threaten because they really don't have legal legs to stand on yet. There a few good ones out there that are inexpensive. Personally I use BTGuard, monthly, quarterly, biannual and yearly rates are inexpensive, they are 100% realiable and help you protect your machines identity in your torrent app only. It does not interfere with any other part of how your machine or internet work, the speeds go as high as your machine can and internet connection can handle, and only takes a couple seconds longer for files to start downloading (since it gets routed to canada first then back to you.) 
I hope you find this helpful and informative. Good luck torrenting and Welcome to The Pirate Bay family!"
,ScarletteSpider,2013-04-22T09:54Z,"oh and one last thing thankyoutoall, don't be a leech . (thats someone that as soon as the file fully downloads deletes the torrent and doesnt seed back) leeches bad, seeders good! 
Set your autostops to seed at least 1.0 ratio or better, (mine is set at 12.0) and doesn't autostop until it has seeded 12 times of 100% and the seeding activity has gone dead for at least 30 minutes. If no one in my region wants that file after both of those criteria then and only then does it stop. "
