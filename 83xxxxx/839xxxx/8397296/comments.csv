The torrent title says 4-21 but the description and the issue uploaded are 4-27. As a result a couple of issues I think are 1-26, 3-9, do you by any chance have them or know which torrents those issues are? I checked them all and can't find them. thanks!"

that's one whole week and magazine is usually released on the first day of the week so it's April 21
if you can't find a certain release from me then it's bpfine who uploaded it :)"
