,bigM15TER,2013-04-22T04:30Z,Great thanks!
,brian_177,2013-04-22T04:32Z,Can someone please comment ASAP whether this episode has the strange audio jump at the end that has plagued ettv torrents recently?
,Lepra_Boy,2013-04-22T04:48Z,"seed please?

and you guys know if the audio-fuckup happens again all you got to do is youtube "" ending"", right?
i did last week, and found the right one before the song was done...
shit happens every now and again...
doesn't take a rocketscientist, shit is free, the MAJOR bitchfest from ""loyal ettv fans"" last week can be solved by paying for HBO..."
,Comr,2013-04-22T04:49Z,"This is the impostor of eztv. Ettv is a fake and thats why the end was messed up last episode. Don't download from ettv, make sure it is eztv!"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-22T04:53Z,"EVOLVE is the person/group that messed up, not ettv. Im almost done downloading, ill check the credits when its done"
,Comr,2013-04-22T04:54Z,"don't download ettv torrents, they are rip off eztv torrents. google search eztv and then google search ettv. Eztv is the real one and doesn't have music in their torrents"
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-22T04:57Z,"i just checked, the last episode recap was in sync and the credits are there, didnt want to spoil the episode by seeing anything else, seems legit to me."
,UT99guy,2013-04-22T04:57Z,I swear to GOD! If the audio is fucked on this one....!!!! .... i will wait 15 mins and download the repack. Then be thankful I dont have to pay for it :P
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-22T04:59Z,"Comr - Seriously??? Dont come in here talking about shit you know nothing about. Ettv uploads torrents before eztv so how in the hell does he rip him off???? Also, both ettv and eztv get these rips from the same source, ettv just uploads them first thus getting the blame for the rare audio glitch, get your facts right dude!"
,TheSeeks,2013-04-22T05:02Z,"I have always downloaded from ETTV and there has only been the last time that I have ever had a problem.  ETTV should not be blamed for something that you are getting for free.  If it is that big of a deal, buy yourself some cable and watch it then.  

In other notes, please seed!"
,ai2006,2013-04-22T05:05Z,"Yeah, paying a sub. Won't pay a sub for a show, not my problem they can't offer a proper alternative.

And not everybody's bitching. Some just want to know if it happens again and either not waste bandwitdh, or wait until they get a proper release just because they don't want the ending ruined. Its not a lack of gratitude, we're just waiting for confirmation.

Not need to get defensive and pissy over others just because some people just ""comment"" on something."

,Adanedher,2013-04-22T05:12Z,"The last episode ended with that song. The problem was the sync of the sound, that's all. There's no trolling or something like that."
,PainToTheWorld,2013-04-22T05:14Z,"I really wanna know, after you finish downloading, you can watch the show without lag even if torrent is open. CANT YOU FUKIN FAGGOTSSS SEED FOR ONCE. "

,decoy720,2013-04-22T05:19Z,Just watched the whole thing. No audio glitches.
,HKCannibal,2013-04-22T05:23Z,"@all -- Stop talking crap, search first about ""the scene"" before drafting any comments useless.
In a simple way ""users"" as ettv or eztv, only release the file access that are published by groups (for example EVOLVE), other words, if there is any problem with the episode is the responsibility of the group that captured the video , and not the ""User"" that released for download, understand that."
,xanat0s,2013-04-22T05:25Z,@Comr shut the fuck up you tool. both ettz and eztv upload compressed EVOLVE versions. go peddle your stupidity on some other site.
,jesterx7769,2013-04-22T05:30Z,"Last weeks was not as messed up like everyone is overreacting. The song was in the credits from HBO, however yes the uploaded video had the song playing too early missing out on the last minute of dialogue but it was fixed. They did not put the song in however to mess with us like ppl think"
,htzrd,2013-04-22T05:32Z,free or not... i hope evolve dont troll us this time

,petden0,2013-04-22T06:18Z,"I heard, that HBO fucked up the last episode. Every release before PROPER was fucked up, not just the EVOLVE one. eztv and ettv only uploads the releases, they have nothing to do with it."
,vylan,2013-04-22T06:27Z,"@ comr you have to be the dumbest piece of shit ever. And to everyone that torrents don't work/ or there are problems, its your fault, something with your shit is wrong. The uploaders arent at fault"
