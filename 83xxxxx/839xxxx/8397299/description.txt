The Boring Identity

Francine tries to mold Stan into her ideal
husband when he gets amnesia after falling
off an arcade game during a CIA operation to
capture the real Osama bin Laden (who,
apparently, has been managing a Dave and
Busters restaurant in Florida). Meanwhile,
Roger lets Steve join his paper route to
earn some extra money, but Steve is drawn
into the corrupt side of the business
