,vcitizen,2013-04-22T10:28Z,"BTW, what is CRF?"
,Tarea,2013-04-22T10:58Z,"@vcitizen: CRF, aka Constant ratefactor, is a type of encoding in the x264 -encoder that renders the whole movie in the same quality, 18 in this case. The smaller the number is, the better the quality will be. 18-19 usually produces very nice quality while still maintaining a nice and small file size."
,iisthphir,2013-04-22T12:07Z,Is this rally only 2 ch audio? why they all only 2 ch? All previous episodes are 5.1.
