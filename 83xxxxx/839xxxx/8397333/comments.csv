[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-22T14:42Z,"already did. i uploaded 15 here:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8029930/
and 16 in my Image Comics pack last week when it came out!  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8387278/"
,DreamingFar,2013-04-22T19:41Z,"Ah I see, you put the apostrophe in a different spot, which is why it didn't show up when I searched for it (although in retrospect I could have shortened the search term, so it's not your fault).

Thank you."
,Calel1234,2013-04-22T20:38Z,"Hey, would you recommend Batman Beyond series? I loved the TV show, but I only read like ten issues and lost interest in the comics. Did it pick up?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-22T23:23Z,"DreamingFar, hey you're right! i never noticed that I did that!! not even when i looked for it for you. well heck if i have time this week, i'll put together a torrent -- with all of them in one place, that'll take care of it. thanks for pointing that out my friend."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-22T23:32Z,"Calel1234 i don't feel like it's the greatest title, but i think it's good if you're a fan of the characters. norm breyfogle (who used to draw the main Batman comic) is very good and has drawn all but #19 & 20 of this series.

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8342054/Batman_Beyond_Unlimited__1-19  has the first 19 issues, by the way!"
