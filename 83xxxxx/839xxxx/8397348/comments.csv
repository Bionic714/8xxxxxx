,mcrowley,2013-04-22T05:50Z,"Thanks eztv & EVOLVE!

xanat0s, I think that sounds about right. I didn't download it though.
  After reading the Powerslave0 comments I decided that my bandwidth would be better off seeding the one with the audio glitch.  Over 15x.  For me and my shitty hick internet, that's quite a lot."
,char17,2013-04-22T06:50Z,"I can't stand how people are bitching and moaning about the credits music starting 20 goddamned seconds early on the last episode. OH GOD WE COULD EVEN HERE LIKE ONE PROBABLY NON IMPORTANT SENTENCE THAT DEFINITELY DOESNT OVERSHADOW THE FACT THAT HE CUTS OF THAT GUYS HAND, WAHHH!"" Again, y'all get this shit for free, and no one owes you a goddamned thing."
,YourWorstNightmare,2013-04-22T06:58Z,Perfect and fast download. Will seed for a few days. Cheers.
,morgainm,2013-04-22T07:10Z,Thank you so much for all the good Game Of Thrones episodes. I can't afford cable right now and am addicted to this show. Look forward to your downloads every week. You rule!!! Thank you!! 
,angelielle,2013-04-22T07:33Z,awesome as always v/a 10/10
,exon1511,2013-04-22T07:33Z,it says it has 14776 seeders however while downloading i have 0 seed. could someone explain why? please be gentle noob here.
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-22T09:24Z,"@char17

That scene where Jaime Lannister gets his sword hand cut off is one of the biggest scenes in the entire story.  I have read all the books. That was a huge thing to have happened in the story, it has permanently changed the type of character Jaime is, and the scene was ruined for many people. "

,torourke22,2013-04-22T14:22Z,Thanks eztv.
,flapdoodle,2013-04-22T17:18Z,Thanks for the up
,barcolux5,2013-04-22T19:01Z,"thx eztv & evolve!

the problems with a few of evolve's releases over the past couple of months read strongly of an automation issue somewhere in the chain. no idea just how much is involved with getting releases out so fast, but I'm pretty sure there isn't a person sitting and watching every frame.

that said, it looks like they may have gotten it sorted. so DOUBLE thanks for that!"
,KrekSvk,2013-04-22T21:51Z,"Great episode, whole thing allright, no damaged sound like before."
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-23T04:59Z,"@NITEIPRI - The pirate bay has a wiki page that shows you how to upload torrents, here is the link https://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page"

Wasn't comfortable providing all information in the email. But it was this torrent, I can assure you. How did I get tracked using [eztv].  Confused!
