,kcufi,2013-04-22T09:14Z,The only tool i trust in there is horizon & modio the rest of that tool has a backdoor lol.
,jakedilla,2013-04-26T06:31Z,"what AoF said is true... anyone who knows how to use these tools knows where to get the latest versions on their own. There's no point in having them all in one package, besides making some fools think they'll somehow be able to mod their 360 with it"
