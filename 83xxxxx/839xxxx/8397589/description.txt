The Leisure Society's third album is a quintessential curate's egg, with plenty of earnest folk-rock strummage, and a few brilliant highlights distracting from several songs as weak as their punning titles, notably ΓÇ£Life Is a CabrioletΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£One Man and His FugΓÇ¥.

The single ΓÇ£Fight for EveryoneΓÇ¥ overdoes the chumminess, with chipper guitar and warm horns supporting its contention that ΓÇ£you just need fire and a little faithΓÇ¥, but elsewhere Nick Hemming's lyrical eye is more profitably applied to subjects like Sylvia Plath in ΓÇ£The Sober Scent of PaperΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£A Softer Voice Takes Longer HearingΓÇ¥. Best of all is ΓÇ£We Go TogetherΓÇ¥, a touching celebration of enduring love strongly reminiscent of the work of Pete Atkin and Clive James.
