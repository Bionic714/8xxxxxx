,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-22T06:02Z,"Everything is straightened out, have at it!!!"
,froogAL,2013-04-22T16:38Z,THX for this
,svidrigailovjones,2013-04-22T19:09Z,"I suppose you think because you are a Carnegie and not a Guggenheim, that everything is OK.

I was waiting for that. It happened, in that sense everything is exactly the way it always is. 

I clearly should not be commenting or uploading.

I try my best, but they make it difficult, which I do not like. Well, at least I am still alive for whatever that is worth."

Please concentrate more on the tunes and less on my often obnoxious commentary ........PAX....A PAX on us all for as long as it matters
