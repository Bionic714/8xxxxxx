,OnAStick,2013-04-23T03:21Z,"@petersith: It's pretty safe to assume that a video is in the original language (in this case English) UNLESS it says otherwise. If it was in a different language, without eztv specifying so, don't you think the comments would reflect that? Duh."

,91dabe,2013-04-23T20:24Z,So does this work with PS3 Media Server or did you upload a broken torrent again?

,Beauharnais,2013-04-24T12:41Z,"I too have the audio who stops working after the prelude. Only no my nexus 7... On the computer, everything is all right. I think this has something to do with the stupid HBO stylized blank screen...."
