,Jack0ff,2013-04-22T07:17Z,this show would be better with less of that fuckin kid in it. the 'son' in this show character sucks and so does his acting
,Du2L5r1,2013-04-22T07:43Z,"@Jack0ff, lol, idk, dude. i'd rather c this one unknown kid do an avg, even terrible job of acting than c another one of the 1/2 dozen or so highest paid actors in the world do even shittier performances and get paid squillions.. give new artists a go, or expect shitty over paid, over exposed narcissists acting just as poorly...just sayin"
,tobywoo,2013-04-22T09:06Z,Or maybe a little more of the mom...ala Game of Thrones? Amiright? Hahaha...

,spockette,2013-04-23T10:18Z,"the comments on this torrent are almost as entertaining as this series!

heres my 2cents, id like to see even more of the brother, hes even hawter now with face scars"
,mook87,2013-04-23T12:36Z,"@Du2L5r1 spot on, I would rather see this kid (although a subpar actor) get paid than someone like Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) - in Episode I Phantom Menace. "
,mook87,2013-04-23T12:37Z,"also, thanks for the upload, winning"

,MrZenjinn,2013-04-24T16:44Z,The reason his son is written about so much is because he is Leif Ericson. He landed in America 500 years before Columbus. Read your history!
,MrZenjinn,2013-04-24T17:22Z,"
I was wrong. This story seems to be partial historic fact, but at least its a good story. I was talking about Erik the Red, and his son, my bad."
,zodii,2013-04-24T21:50Z,"The show had potential, but I can seriously say I stoped watching it and I stoped liking it solely because of that kid, the ""son"". He's so annoying and such a bad actor that i'd rather pick the neighbours ADHD and mentally challanged 5 year old kid to take his place instead.

I've never seen a movie or series in my entire life that has someone who acts that poorly, ever. I can pretty much guarantee you that you won't be able to link me any actor that is worse than him, even if you link your own video from when you acted in preschool pretending to be michael jackson or something - it won't be worse."

IT IS THE FIRST EPISODE OF THIS SERIE THAT I DIDN´T LIKE...
VIKINGS MAKE ME REMEMBER ...MAYAS...MAKING SACRIFICES WITH HUMANS EVEN IS OWN RACE .
CRAZY."
,TitMonger,2013-04-26T02:59Z,"@tobywoo  Yeah, the mom is a real VILF. I would like to raid and pillage her panties. I can't believe you guys are hung on the kid. He has a minor part and then we are off to pillage the village and rape the lockstock or do shrooms in the mountains while fucking and drinking."
