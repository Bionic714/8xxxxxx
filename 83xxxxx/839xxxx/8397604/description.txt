"Kirsty McGeeΓÇÖs latest album Contraband deals in wounds and healing with remarkable honesty, and itΓÇÖs not always a comfortable listen. Not through any paucity of quality, but because it openly deals with her recovery from depression and what she describes as ΓÇ£a string of personal disastersΓÇ¥. Close to quitting music for good, she instead cobbled together a band of friends and collaborators and distilled the pain in arguably its most potent form ΓÇö great songwriting. ItΓÇÖs unapologetically raw and intense, the rest is melancholy squared. Yet, by the end you come away feeling hopeful and restored, rather than weighed down by the relentless waves of emotion."
