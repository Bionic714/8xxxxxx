Gold Leaves is a new project of Grant Olsen, half of Seattle folk duo Arthur & Yu, but GLΓÇÖs debut release The Ornament was four years in the making. After scratching sessions for a straightforward country or R&B-flavored album, the singer/songwriter hooked up with PapercutsΓÇÖ Jason Quever to produce a campfire-ready collection of honey-voiced, subtly orchestrated Americana. Take a listen to the Fleet Foxy roots rock of ΓÇ£Cruel/Kind,ΓÇ¥ along with the albumΓÇÖs more ΓÇÖ60s-nodding title track.

Grant Olsen, the Arthur portion of SeattleΓÇÖs Arthur & Yu, is gearing up to release his debut solo album. Using the moniker Gold Leaves, Olsen will release his album, The Ornament, on the Hardly Art label on August 16th. From the sound of the first single, also called ΓÇ£The OrnamentΓÇ¥, Gold LeavesΓÇÖ music lands solidly in the psychedelic indie-pop singer/songwriter vein, and the results are pretty impressive.
