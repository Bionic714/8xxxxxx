[V],psspss,2013-04-22T07:14Z,i random checked it but looks like it might be +200ms out of sync or perhaps its just at the beginning.. since i havent watched it
[V],psspss,2013-04-22T08:30Z,confirmed its not too bad but annoying.. my random checks missed it its easy to fix with a tool called avimuxgui which is free. open it. click the large button under window then click the audo track on far side enter 200 and then click start/save and it will be done all in sync http://www.afterdawn.com/software/audio_video/video_tools/avi-mux_gui.cfm takes about 30seconds to fix and write the file!
[V],psspss,2013-04-22T08:35Z,the gui not too friendly.. right click on the window to load the avi too handy tool to know and use for many avi fixing
