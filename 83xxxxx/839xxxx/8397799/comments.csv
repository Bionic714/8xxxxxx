Any chance of the ROOK series being reseeded?

Or Richard Corben's DEN being ul?

Nice to see you back!  ;-)"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-22T19:06Z,"Thanks bg, and you're most welcome. Good to be back.

Den, absolutely yes. That was always my plan, but I can't locate a complete version of NeverWhere (the first volume). Short of that I'm ready to go.

The Rook I don't have, but I'll put it on the search list."

[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-23T05:49Z,"No BC, but thank you for posting it, because somebody had asked me for it a while back and I totally spaced it!

I was looking for the first volume of Den, which is called NeverWhere. Or rather, I was looking for a complete version, as one after another of the files I was finding were only half the book. I finally found it this afternoon, though. "
