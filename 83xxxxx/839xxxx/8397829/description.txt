Changelog:

Hey! It's been a while, we've been working on our new game Prevail and then we thought, oh wow, Plunderland needs an update for the iPhone 5 and the new iPad resolution!

So that's what this update brings, along with some new visuals for the menus and it's all just a bit cleaner now too.

You might notice something new in the Arcade mode if you check it out.


Don't forget to seed!
