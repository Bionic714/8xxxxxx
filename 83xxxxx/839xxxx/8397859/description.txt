Yes, there is a tear across one half of about 75% of the pages. Yes, the cover is basically non-existent. Yes, it is still totally readable. In fact, it doesn't really get in the way at all, and this is still one of the best looking things Corben ever did. I have an even better looking version of this, but it's in French. If I feel like gettin' crazy with the Cheez Whiz one day I might go ahead and drop all the English text over the French word bubbles. For now, I hope you enjoy this one as is...
