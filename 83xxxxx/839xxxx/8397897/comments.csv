Guess I'll be the first. I'll post back after completed."
,armywife9,2013-04-22T23:37Z,"can anyone tell me how to remove the subtitles from YIFY movies? great downloads and wonderful movies, I'm just not a fan of subtitles. Thanks in advance."
,PauloFran,2013-04-23T00:45Z,"Good video quality.
Thank you!"
,HampTheToker,2013-04-23T02:58Z,"A/V 10/10

I haven't watched it all the way through, but I skimmed it and looks flawless on my monitor. I don't anticipate any different on the big screen. Many thanks, YIFY.

@armywife9, all you have to do is delete the .srt file. If using VLC you can click Video > Subtitles Track > Disable to disable subtitles instead of deleting the file outright just in case you might need it some day."
,krikri3,2013-04-23T03:15Z,why not 4.37gb to fit in a dvd giving a little more quality
,joegi50,2013-04-23T04:31Z,Thank you YI-Fi.
,Avlid86,2013-04-23T21:55Z,Seed m8s seed. downloading in like 5/kbs :(
,krikri3,2013-04-24T02:19Z,hey thx for the release but quality is dvdish
,motzaburg,2013-04-25T22:35Z,Anyone else having difficulty playing this on a PS3? Plays fine on PC and XBOX 360.
,ectoendomezo,2013-04-27T19:25Z,"Nice Picture/Video quality..but..sigh..per the usual and I forgot..No Hardsubs for Alien Language.

Sort of..(only sort of) surprised to see someone (armywife) state they ""don't like subtitles""..which is literally stating ""I don't want to understand half the plot..."".

Anyway..there's a very good ""Aliens Only"" subtitle at subscene..takes actual seconds to load and thus fix the flaw in this torrent..unless you don't mind 'turning English subs 'on'-'off' every time the 'Nabu' speak?

The mortal fatal flaw in McTorrents continues to be no Hardsubs for Non-English speaking parts.

Argo..Premium Rush..Avatar..many many more..TPB needs a new 'Indicator Code' to make it easier to find the TRULY superior torrents which the UL'er(s) have taken the time and have the skill and 'artistry' to create/provide hardsubs."
,kimpegorini,2013-04-30T08:09Z,why 4gb? there is already an avatar 1080p 2.19gb YIFY. I thought their objective was to create files with good quality and smaller size :/
