Amidst heavy competition, Baby Mammoth is the Pork labelΓÇÖs most prolific act, packing in five full LPs of blunted instrumental hip-hop between their debut in late 1996 and the end of the decade.

Like other Pork acts Fila Brazillia and Solid Doctor, the duo of Mark Blissenden and Andrew Burdall specialize in earthy breaks and ambient atmospheres, more slanted to the instrumental edge of acid jazz than other producer-based trip-hop acts.
