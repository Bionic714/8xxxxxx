,jwinston78,2013-04-22T12:32Z,is this theatrical ver or extended cut?? cuz extended cut ver is 178min..
,vcdman17,2013-04-22T14:18Z,"I have downloaded the extended cut from YIFY in the past. I'm not sure why it would be reposted, but perhaps the info above is copied and pasted from IMDB. This should be what it says knowing YIFY."
,Mutegrill,2013-04-22T15:47Z,"It's not a repost, I think. This rip LOOKS better - judging by the preview pictures - than YIFY-group's earlier release. Not SUBERB (720p), but ok.

The ""Extended Collectors Edition"" is the name of the box release, containing six discs containing extra material and three movie versions:

The Cinematic 162 min
The Special Edition Re-release, 171 min (showed at US theaters)
The Collector's Cxtended Cut, 178 min

YIFY's details states this torrent contains The Cinematic Version (162 minutes), NOT the Extended Cut. However, only way to be sure is someone downloads it and tells us which version it is."

Thank you!"
,gramranger,2013-04-23T15:20Z,"Is this actually a re-rip? Because the first one YIFY posted (and almost everyone else) for the ECE version was horrible, of such bad quality. I will try grabbing this one (again?) and seeing if it is so."
,MrBoob89,2013-04-24T04:47Z,Just about every movie I've ever download from this guy has been really good quality; at least watching on my laptop. I would bet that this is good quality. Will download and update
,1qwerty7,2013-04-24T16:41Z,It's 178 minutes so it's the right source material. Does anybody know of a good set of English forced-only subtitiles for this version?
,gramranger,2013-04-26T16:23Z,"Well, the quality is good... but its got built in FULL subtitles for EVERYTHING. Not just the alien language parts.

I get so sick of piss poor subtitle handling. So to get subtitles for the alien parts (who the hell understands navi?) ... you have to put up with crap all over the screen for the parts you can hear and understand. Pathetic.

Now i have to spend hours hunting down or making up my own subtitles, and then fighting the ones buried in the file each time it plays."
,gramranger,2013-04-26T16:34Z,"These subtitles work better for getting navi only parts (and not every spoken word in the whole movie):

Syncs just right with this YIFY rip."
,okonomiyaki,2013-04-27T16:35Z,It is the extended version..
