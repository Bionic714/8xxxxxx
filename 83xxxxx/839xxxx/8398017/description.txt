'The Octopi and the Ocean'

Top Shelf Productions, 2004, 53 pages

Written and Illustrated by Dan James

A small boy finds himself deep within the timeless ocean, directly between a pack of artifact guarding sharks and a manipulative civilization of marriage seeking octopi. Throw in selfish parents, the postal system, and a cockroach tree and you've got the premier epic story from Dan James. This largely wordless narrative is only matched in elegance by the strikingly stylistic use of brush line and solid mass to seal the fate of one spineless, yet resilient child.
