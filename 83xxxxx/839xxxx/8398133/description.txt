Overview:

Twenty-two years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the world has become embroiled in a series of conflicts centered around an ever-dwindling resource: oil. MankindΓÇÖs hopes for world peace lie battered and broken. Take command of SternΓÇÖs Wildcats, an elite squadron of mercs trying to fly straight in a world of deceit and violence. Engage rival merc squadrons, third world dictators, and the armies of the dreaded IRS. In a world gone mad, thereΓÇÖs plenty of room to fly, all thatΓÇÖs required is the cash.

Strike Commander puts you in the best place to witness fast-paced dogfighting action: the pilotΓÇÖs seat. Fly high as you take on over 60 missions, each more challenging than the last in your top-of the-line F16 squadron piloted by the best crew in the business (operational success rate of 86%). Strike Commander is a classic flight combat sim where a pilot is only as good as his, or her, last flight. Fly to survive and survive to fly, in this modern-day action-oriented jet fighter combat simulation!
