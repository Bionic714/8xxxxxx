What's cool about it:

   A bizarre amalgamation of first person game, role-playing features, a non-linear plot, and real time flow.
   Three unique characters who act independently. When one is chosen, the two rejected heroes act on their own, plotting against you.
   A town with a life of its own that changes and reacts to your behavior.

Overview:

A weird town crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir--but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed a odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or--failing that--an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third--and last--outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.
