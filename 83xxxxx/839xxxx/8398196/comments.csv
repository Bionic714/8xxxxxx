,samshaikh,2013-04-22T10:45Z,Screen shots please...
,crumrugin,2013-04-23T01:52Z,Good cam V7 A6 a little dark..widescreen
,misterburnz,2013-04-25T06:01Z,"no screens kinda stinks but if you aren't sure about something download only the sample file. It looks awesome for a CAM RiP.

M:10
V:7-8 (NOT HD by any means)
A: 6 (probably the biggest letdown, kinda tinny still)

The word I feel that describes the quality best is simply this, VHS. It's equally as good as if you hooked up an old VHS to your new fancy plasma. 

I've been waiting day by day for a better copy and here it is fans of Bruce Campbell "
,_Rabbi_,2013-04-27T23:26Z,"Yes, this is much better than all those other copies... No subtitles, looks like they used an HD camera that is not always auto-focusing on the screen. Cheers to the uploader, finally something of good quality.
V-9 (for a cam)
A-7 (for a cam)
I found no parts to be annoying, blurry, or even too dark."
,Alitheia59500,2013-04-28T00:36Z,This is the best version you'll find for now. Vid 8 Aud 7
,BKKJack,2013-05-03T07:25Z,Very decent copy for a cam...
,Sam_Raimi,2013-05-06T02:11Z,"You have got to be kidding me!
You people are actually watching these cuts?!
This copy is a joke, its horrible, just as the last 3 torrents I commented on............
Fools, your all fools....."
,shawn79,2013-05-22T01:08Z,Well see if you all want a good copy take you're camera to a theater sneak it in risk federal prison time and upload it but if not QUIT BITCHING
,shawn79,2013-05-22T01:13Z,So I'm guessing this one isn't all spliced togther from 2 sources cause no one commented badly cheers to u my uploading freind
,AxDeath,2013-05-23T06:27Z,"45 minutes in, source switches, rest of movie, complete bullshit. unwatchable."
