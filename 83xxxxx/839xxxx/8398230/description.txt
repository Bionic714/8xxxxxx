"Crazier" is a song by American recording artist Taylor Swift. The song was written by Swift and Robert Ellis Orrall and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. The song was featured in both the film Hannah Montana: The Movie and on its soundtrack. The song is a relaxed ballad with country pop qualities and lyrics that describe being in love. Swift performed the song as herself during a cameo in the Hannah Montana: The Movie; this scene was taken from the film and released as a music video for "Crazier".

"Crazier" was praised by critics, many of whom named it the best song on the soundtrack. Digital downloads began immediately after the soundtrack's release on March 23, 2009, and led to commercial success in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Its highest international peak was at number seventeen on the United States chart, the Billboard Hot 100.
