[V],psspss,2013-04-22T11:28Z,"too bad about the leechers.. force seeding it now

20 percent and 9 max haha"
[V],psspss,2013-04-22T13:52Z,20 seeders (real) now so leaving you to it.. perhaps it will speed up now the leechers gone
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T07:10Z,"Kat ph is a bunch of lamers.. they keep deleting my comments and asking me not to post comments.. fuck them and their miods.. dickheads.. piraters make their site top uploaders make their site
and pirates dont follow fooking rules

if they delete my account I want them to also then stop fooking indexing my torrents from HERE "
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T00:31Z,"Im not longer be visiting kat much nor adding my torrents there

followers will have to stay here again and comment
to me.. although this place lacks a wall

until a good site design like DEMONOID comes along again"
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T13:02Z,and tne you too.. who cares what you think.. posting crap to my torrents too.. its obvious whso sidde your on they are your mates they made you as mod after all.. again we share torrents cos its community.. post to comments about the torrents and contents benefits the site cos it draws people in via searches more eyes more revenue. for them shame they dont get it.. this is where demonoid rules.. it had the best site designed and staff saying post to forum to talk about a show is lame vos people vist the torrent and talk about it there.. how it should work
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T13:07Z,"also since they have a warning disclaimer your liable for uploads that makes it a unsafe place to upload now.. means they could expose you when someone comes knocking. shit the shit always scrapped demon and here the torrents they need uploaders for the content site dies if not
this is the main reason i joined to organise the torrents they scraped and the disclaimer is why I no longer trust the site as a uploader"
,pwnt_soup,2013-04-27T05:46Z,have no idea what thats about as i only use TPB and torrentday but I'm glad your still posting here because i enjoy some of your files. will you start posting some of the gun related shows again like sons of guns and others? thanks for you uploads psspss!
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T10:32Z,"whats its about is posting comments like this gets deleted by admin at kat as they only want it related torrents problems and quality 


anyhow .. no I think afg is doing son of guns and others doing mp4s as well.

due to data restrictions (i used to have unlimited but isp decided they couldnt throttle it and remove it it was 80gb but now 150gb due to another $20 cost but both never last) "
