Storyline

Janice (Jenna Fischer) is down on her luck. Out of work and living with her well-intentioned but overbearing sister Jill, Janice is struggling to find her way and build a fulfilling life for herself. When she meets Tim (Chris Messina), a street performer whose unique talents as a "living statue" don't exactly pay the bills, she recognizes a kindred spirit. As they get to know each other, Janice begins to feel that she has met a like-minded person who could make her happy. But as their connection begins to blossom, Jill's meddling ways threaten to undermine Janice's first real shot at love.
