,panagos13713,2013-04-22T13:15Z,"Thanks for the upload! I dont own an ihas burner so I am wondering whether or not the previous problem, which caused the game to crash after 3 minutes, still exists!"
,-Yuki-,2013-04-22T13:21Z,"I have the same doubt, i surely hope not."
,Igliu,2013-04-22T14:31Z,If you don't know how to write for XGD3 then don't bother to download 
,AoF,2013-04-22T15:17Z,"Been waiting awhile, could have came sooner though."
,-Yuki-,2013-04-22T15:39Z,"Do'nt be rude, Dragon's Dogma had an extra protection that other games don't, we want to know if this one has that security, i know how to burn XGD3 games."
,viciousewp,2013-04-22T17:47Z,"ty so much as usual ghostnet you are the tits, TO the people who always say no Ihas fucking just buy a god damn ihas on the net..you are already saving by burning games why not just really make legit copies? anyyyways The first DVD is us the original whilst the second is expansion? if so ill only dl 2."
,-Yuki-,2013-04-22T19:01Z,"I don't live in the states, and i don't know where i can buy one, it's not lack of money, it's lack of knowing where i can find it!"
,Theodd.bob,2013-04-22T21:13Z,Yuki i got mu ihas from amazon 
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-22T21:33Z,"i hope they 'fixed' the 1st dvd cos i wanna play badly this game..yep, just like the rest couldn play this game cos it crashed every 3 min :("
[T],razalgul1979,2013-04-22T21:51Z,"Yuki take a look at google and search for BurnerMax payloadtool 0.15, is a solution for those who don't have Liteon and is compatible with most burners

Don't waste your time with truncade"
,viciousewp,2013-04-22T22:22Z,so first disc is not just an exact copy of the original dragons dogma? please confirm and thank you. ALso you YUKI can go to xconsoles.com they sell ihas burners that are already flashed and set up with burnermax. its the B models that are the Ihas compatibles go check otu the side.
,-Yuki-,2013-04-22T23:29Z,"Okay, thanks both of you ^^"
[T],razalgul1979,2013-04-23T00:46Z,"@ Igliu

Nobody is born knowing, we're here to add, share and help each other,  stop being aggressive with other members

And @Yuki Verbatim is the best to burn "
,JTaGRRRR,2013-04-23T01:27Z,Why not just get a JTaG if you can or RGH your box and be done with all that disk crap!! :)
,vinnievic86,2013-04-23T02:57Z,SEED PEOPLE!!! Also you DON'T need an ihas burner! I burn games on multiple computers with various burners and never get coasters. If you use the programs correctly and have a proper flash job your good to go.
,vinnievic86,2013-04-23T03:17Z,SEED PEOPLE!!
,aisac007,2013-04-23T03:32Z,RGH is waaaaay more simple. Also... seed please!
,scythe06,2013-04-23T06:05Z,Burned with burnermax payload on ihas C and worked fine. Thanks for the upload Gh0stNet. 
,Igliu,2013-04-23T06:34Z,"I wasn't being aggressive , I just told them to look xgd3 up first , because I know that's what caused the crashing ."
,Trehnt,2013-04-23T08:04Z,"Yeah, everytime i try to extract the iso for my RGH nothing shows up in the DVD1 folder."
,aisac007,2013-04-23T10:07Z,Trehnt what program are u using to extract?
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-23T18:02Z,"#vinnievic86
your mouth writes cheques that your a$$ cant cash..stop tellin us what to do..its freakin plain n simple, the previous DD didn work, just like Bioshock Infinite..so we r curious to know whether this version works or not..."
,anomanom,2013-04-23T19:30Z,Please seed! And thank you for upload 
,Trehnt,2013-04-23T21:47Z,"@aisac007 XBOX360 iso extract, works every time except for disk on on this"
,aisac007,2013-04-23T21:59Z,so frikn slow :(
,aisac007,2013-04-23T22:35Z,"Trehnt try using iso2god and if u dont like the god version, save the ""rebuilt"" version that comes out and the extract that one with extract-XISO. works for me every time, no exeptions"
,vinnievic86,2013-04-24T02:21Z,Assassinprofessor.. I can cash a lot more than you know. Keep mouthing off and see where it gets you bud.
,vinnievic86,2013-04-24T02:24Z,I seed 24/7 for everyone.. It is a very simple to do. If you download seed.
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-24T13:16Z,can you play only the expansion pack just like Batman arkham city? 
,phuitro,2013-04-24T14:10Z,"""Unreadable"" both truncated and with burnermax.
It somehow managed to install but still unreadable.
It's weird since I can see the game titles running in the back behind the ""unreadable"" pop up.

I don't know what to do, I really wanted to play that game."
,anomanom,2013-04-24T16:15Z,Disc 2 cant read disc data . Do i need to update anything ?
,tumo06,2013-04-25T02:17Z,"I'm having the exact problem as phuitro. 
Can anyone else please confirm that it's working?"
,Idus15,2013-04-25T02:57Z,OK' i have a really dumb question. i just started burring games to discs and this file is 15GB. I can't find a disc bigger than 8.5GB how yould you even play this?
,aisac007,2013-04-25T05:12Z,"you need 2 discs... or even way better RGH and n 
o discs.. everrrr"
,samengo,2013-04-25T19:48Z,ISO-Extract cant extract Thema first CD :(     Anyone got tips?
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-26T00:42Z,Can someone confirm whether the 1st DVD works..is it the same dvd just like the one that we got error every sec..pls anyone
,azuziel,2013-04-26T16:14Z,"THanks to the uploader. Great series. Dunno about burning, but works extracted. I'll continue to seed, would appreciate if others did as well. was so slow. "
,hellfire019,2013-04-28T18:05Z,Downloading at 5kb/s which doesn't seem right with all the seeds : /
,hellfire019,2013-04-29T02:15Z,It went up to 200kb/s then dropped and won't go back up
,hardcorecouple69,2013-04-29T11:43Z,i love my jtag console no problems worrying if it will work or not but with the 1st dragons dogma both iso extract and wx360 wouldnt extract the image so i used iso2god and it worked fine and the same with this one i had to use iso2god again. now i have over 500 games installed on my consoles hard drives. if you have a jtag or rgh i also highly recomend using the latest freestyle dash with dashlaunch to launch it straight into it. its bloody awesome.
,r4t,2013-04-29T12:22Z,hardcorecouple69 HA you have to extract all your games i have someting even more simple its called the xkey. I DONT EXTRACT FUCK ALL JUST COPY TO THE HARD DRIVE AND PLAY. SO YOU TELL ME WHAT IS THE POINT OF SAYING YOU HAVE A JTAG BIG DEAL.
,Theodd.bob,2013-04-29T17:45Z,Abgx360 verification not found is this safe to play on line?
,GetBangedOnNewb,2013-04-30T01:11Z,"*****NOTE*****
if you are having trouble extracting iso through image browser, etc. try right clicking the game file (large one) go to properties and uncheck read-only and click apply. now it should work pop up in image brower. disc 2 is the HD textures pack for better enhanced graphics. as to using a jtag/rgh i do not know how to get this to work. I've extracted the content through image browser and added it to my HDD:1/content/000000000000000/Game Title/00000002 and added the TU but still no luck if anyone knows a solution to this please help me out the graphics are unbearable w/o the texture pack "
,hardcorecouple69,2013-04-30T11:31Z,@ r4t i was saying about i love my jtag because you here alot of people complaining they cant get the burnt game to work. and the reason why i extract the game is because of the size of most games are 8gb per image but when extracted it might only be 2gb so i save on space which was a big issue for me when i only had an internal 1tb hdd but now i have an external 2tb connected too but its filling up very fast and it would already be full if i didnt extract the games to make them smaller
,hardcorecouple69,2013-04-30T14:03Z,@GetBangedOnNewb i think you should put the texture pack into the content/0000000000000000/ not into the extra content folder 00000002. i might be wrong but try it out
,Assassinprofessor,2013-04-30T22:04Z,"doesnt work guys, just like the older version..great for wasting a dozen dvds "
,GetBangedOnNewb,2013-05-01T03:12Z,"*****PLEASE READ*****
if you are having trouble installing dlc look no more
For RGH I can confirm that is hdd1/content/0000000000000000/43430814/00000002 is the correct path. If it does not exist, just create it and copy the 2 files on content folder of disc 2

The path hdd1/content/0000000000000000/FFED2000/FFFFFFFF/ does not work. Don't copy the 2 files there."
,rauth213,2013-05-01T05:27Z,"Disk 2 is just Jap Voice and HD texture packs.  You need Disk 1, fuck Disk 2.  Fuck ""DVD2 is teh Expansion Installer!"" cus it's fucking not."
,punkfreak123,2013-05-03T05:54Z,ABGX still has not verified this as of 5/2
,jdawg3706,2013-05-05T23:45Z,It works fine run one disc without burnermax and use that to install to hard drive then burn one disc with burnermax and play with that disc. Not verified on agbx yet even though its been out for a couple weeks does anyone know if its still safe to play online?
,joker9808,2013-05-10T22:09Z,thank you friend for the upload.
,JSusie,2013-05-15T00:40Z,"Sucks that even as of 5/14 this game isn't verified on ABGX yet.

And for those who arent going into the past pages of comments, disc 2 is actually the HD texture pack and japanese voices.  You don't need it at all to play the game, everything gameplay related is on disc 1."

,Soularis,2013-05-20T09:32Z,"So for those of you having issues extracting disc1.

I looked around and was able to extract it with Xbox-Image-Browser-v2.9.0.345

tested it and it seems to be working.

it did take longer than usual to extract. "
