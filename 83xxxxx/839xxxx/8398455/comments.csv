,beatles94,2013-04-22T15:16Z,"There's a sooner version and it's just 200Mb in size
Why's yours this large? Just wonder ..."
,Oddbrother,2013-04-22T16:01Z,"A successful torrent!

Just so people know, this Steam rip is different, and has many more things than the free Game Jam prototype."
,NecroFile,2013-04-22T16:13Z,It's bigger because it has the Steam exclusive stuff.
,2013man2004,2013-04-22T18:43Z,nice

,yourmomslover112,2013-04-28T15:12Z,"""There should be 'ss2013_Data'

,ftasic,2013-04-30T03:28Z,Has Virus!
,moeburn1,2013-04-30T18:01Z,"Works great on Win7 64bit, although I already have steam installed, I dunno if that makes a difference, its not like steam actually started or anything."
,fliter16,2013-05-01T04:26Z,"Game is cracked properly and works, but it's a poorly designed game and I can neither win the game or see why the game is fun.  

There's something kind of spooky about the game actually."
,blaynem,2013-05-02T01:14Z,"@filter16
What do you mean ""It's poorly designed.""?
Do you know how much time had to be put into the game to make the physics work and the graphics nearly accurate? Just the simple fact that they could make a 3D game that involves surgery is mind boggling as it is. Then add different effects of all of the tools and you have an amazing game. But yes, the beginning was a little difficult for me. Just keep trying."
,xboxjunkiepro,2013-05-02T03:32Z,how do i copy stuff do my hard drive?
,moeburn1,2013-05-07T22:07Z,"Alright I beat all the levels, up to Ambulance - Brain Transplant.  But then for some reason in that particular level, my framerate PLUMMETS and the game becomes horribly choppy and stuttering and is completely unplayable.  Which is really weird, considering that I get 60fps in all the other levels.  Oh and lowering graphics settings does nothing.

A quick google search reveals that people have had this same problem on a variety of different levels, but there is no fix yet."
,Sejtan666,2013-05-11T14:20Z,My body is ready. 
,daniler445,2013-05-15T19:31Z,"works great!!!
thanks for that"
,sxybsty13,2013-06-01T22:46Z,"When I start the game , there's just a black screen. "
,krikavka,2013-06-02T17:38Z,Awesome! Thanks a lot ;) 
,twstdspirit,2013-06-10T14:59Z,"shit game, dont bother."
