When seventeen-year-old Katy 

Swartz moved to West Virginia right before her senior year, 

sheΓÇÖd pretty much resigned herself to thick accents, dodgy

internet access, and a whole lot of boring, but then she

spotted her hot neighbor, with his looming height and 

eerie green eyes. Things were looking upΓÇªuntil he opened 

his mouth. Daemon Black is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-

worthy. ItΓÇÖs hate at first sight, but when a stranger 

attacks her and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave 

of his hand, well, somethingΓÇªunexpected happens. The hot 

guy next door? Well, heΓÇÖs an alien. Turns out that Daemon 

and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal 

their abilities and Katy is caught in the crosshairs. 

DaemonΓÇÖs touch has lit her up like the Vegas Strip and the 

only way sheΓÇÖs getting out of this alive is by sticking 

close to him until her alien mojo fades. That is if she 

doesnΓÇÖt kill him first.
