,papayrus,2013-04-24T07:44Z,Do you have this without the content?
,papayrus,2013-04-24T07:44Z,By the way thanks for the upload.
,McGunt,2013-04-24T23:02Z,"Thanks, seems to work okay so far. Where are the audio editing programs like soundtrax & wav editor? Are they even in version 12? can anyone enlighten me...the people at Nero are bloody useless."
,cipri84,2013-04-25T12:51Z,@McGunt. Those where removed from nero. You have to install them if you need them.
,wirke,2013-05-03T21:02Z,Without the ContentPack would be nice.
,RafVne2,2013-05-07T09:28Z,"wav editor, and some others is a free download from nero's site"
,RafVne2,2013-05-08T02:52Z,"@ChingLiu

Thanks buddy for the up. 
Previously, I have gotten your release ""12.5.01300 Platinum Retail"" which worked as advertised, but 01300 had a problem with ""Nero recode"", videos audio was encoded out of sync.

Do you know if they have fixed it in this release?"
[V],murphy78,2013-05-10T06:43Z,Thx for the up bud...
,angelbeats1989,2013-05-10T21:20Z,"Yeah . Thank you ChingLiu 
Keep up the good work mate :)"
,blombardo,2013-05-13T07:01Z,"Installs fine - has same error as another I tested: nero video ""cannot import pictures as titles"" so you cant do fancy menu modifications with this version either... I guess you need a newer update."
,imad_1970,2013-05-15T20:14Z,Thanks
,LionSword,2013-05-19T18:44Z,None of the 2 serials provided worked for me
,dukeofurl,2013-05-20T07:18Z,All of the serials provided are blacklisted.
,Optimus_past_my_Prime,2013-05-20T16:18Z,"I was having the same problem with the two serials not working for me but I think it was because the patch wasn't installing. At first I was right clicking and running the patch as administrator and the patch kept failing. The second time around I right clicked, went to  properties and under the compatibility tab checked the box to run as administrator. It worked after that. Hope this helps."
,Ariesdragon1978,2013-05-21T15:26Z,Thanx for the up
,RafVne2,2013-06-08T03:44Z,"As I've said before, version 12 is buggy, most notably audio is out of sync when recoding, so I've gone back to nero 10, and everything is working fine now, But I have a question...

Does anyone know how to install 3Dsmart menu templates from nero 12 content pack, to nero 10?

Just copying the relevant files to the folder doesn't work... Nerovision just doesn't see them.

I mean I have a content packs installed for nero 10, but there were few new ones in nero 12 which I'd like to get.

Anyone?"
