,wildpig1234,2013-04-23T10:02Z,thank you.  Do  you have all the episodes from 88-90? plz up all.  much appreciated.
,russell887,2013-04-23T15:36Z,"Yes Wildpig1234 I have the entire 88"" season and will upload them all in 4 episode torrents!!  I'm sorry about the speed of this one...I encountered a torrent error early on in the seeding stages and was lucky a couple of people were finished downloading and were seeding!"
,wildpig1234,2013-04-24T02:56Z,cool.  that's 35 episodes.  guess that will take about 9 torrents.  I am guessing you ripping them one disc with 4 episodes at a time?  After you're done should make a torrent and consolidate them into one torrent.  People with the episodes will join in so you won't have to completely seed it again.  Always good to have one torrent instead of multiple torrent files ;)
,russell887,2013-04-24T18:03Z,There are 5 DVD's to the full 88' season and I've already uploaded 2 so there is 3 more to go...total size is approx. - 13 to 14 GB. Whenever I uploaded very large torrents before they were never taken to well...alway's complaints about seeders and they died early...this is why I'm breaking this up into 5 torrents! Cheers..
,wildpig1234,2013-04-27T13:57Z,"thanks dude.  Do you have the rest of the revival series episode from 1989-90, season 2?
