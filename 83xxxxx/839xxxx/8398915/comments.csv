,firedart,2013-04-22T21:07Z,"its ok for people like me, who has 50tb of space and 7.6 mbps speed,unlimited

PS. i am blessed yify god,and its a honour to seed you torrent"
,firedart,2013-04-22T21:16Z,"@Garryhall 
then what the hell did you think,it will be 35 GB like Bozx ? ,thats BS, and this is why we consider yify as our torrent god , he uploads on small size's comparatively with only minimum quality loss which is almost flawless . that's why he is so successful and famous,and most people who use torrent have merely 1 Mbps and a just 100 GB of space."
,deeser,2013-04-23T13:53Z,"Me, i like that god YIFI post's the image from the box.. so we can faster see that is a shitty movie ;D"
,hxxq,2013-04-23T20:06Z,"@firedart: BOZX Uploads 35 GB torrent, coz its in pure HD taken Directly from Source  without alteration, a 42 GB OR 35 GB movie can be played on +50"" inch screen in near pristine quality & also it can be saved on terabyte Hardrive. Yify torrents are ripped & reduced to lower size without damaging AV (although some amount will be lost ) can be played on a 30 or 42"" inch or on a laptop. YIFY Audio is better than before.."
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-24T05:02Z,"Warning: More shyte from YIFY. Video stutters (like many of his rips) and the starting seems to have been edited on. But if that sounds like what you want, grab it."
,ebonyswan,2013-04-24T06:00Z,no subtitles?  Come on.
,dac13,2013-04-24T21:26Z,Sorry but both 1080p and 720p are not good... lots of flickering.
,dizzytyron,2013-04-25T07:22Z,"I'm getting a lot of stuttering too, I've tried it on my computer, PS3 & blu-ray player & all played it the same."
,dizzytyron,2013-04-25T08:52Z,"Having said that, other than that the picture & sound quality are phenomenal."
,Yinse,2013-05-04T03:05Z,"Way to much stutter, same with the 720, i downloaded both from YIFY and deleted both 10 seconds into watching and now i'm off to download someone elses in hopes there is no stutter"
,Matiass1997,2013-05-04T13:47Z,thx very much :) very nice movie i really love it because a lot of action 
,InitialDrifter87,2013-05-07T05:20Z,the stuttering goes away after the movie actually starts so im happy with it
