,capgunkid,2013-05-02T19:35Z,"I just got a message from the RISC store that Victory records is refusing to deliver copies of the album to the band as originally agreed. If you preordered it and haven't received it yet, hang in there -- it should be arriving as soon as they resolve it. Until then, download and enjoy!

DOWN WITH VICTORY RECORDS and LONG LIVE STREETLIGHT!"
