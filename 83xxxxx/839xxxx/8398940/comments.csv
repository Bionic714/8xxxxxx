I'm trying to figure out the best way to reup the old ones as is. And such that if the D returned they would also work for there.

It isn't clean. I upload the old torrent. I then delete it from my uTorrent and my hard drive. I download the new one. But it is pointing at my incompletes folder. I tried changing the download location under Advanced. It asks if I want to overwrite. Whichever I choose doesn't seem to work. So then I delete the torrent from uTorrent and reload with ""(no default save)."" This works, but seems a bit round about. And for some strange reason it creates a duplicate torrent file in the folder.

I am still seeding all my Demonoid torrents, on the hope that the D will come back. Of course, without a tracker the only takers are from peer-to-peer. This isn't many, and is a rather inefficient way to distribute music under the BitTorrent protocol."
