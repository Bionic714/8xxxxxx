Biography from All Music (by Jason Ankeny):

California surf band the Sunrays was organized in 1964 by producer Murry Wilson following his dismissal as manager of his sons' group, the Beach Boys; organized around singer/songwriter/drummer Rick Henn, a friend of Beach Boy Carl Wilson, the lineup also included guitarists Eddie Medora and Byron Case as well as pianist Marty DiGiovanni, all three of whom previously recorded as the Snowmen. Completing their sound with bassist Vince Hozier, the Sunrays signed to the Tower label and soon issued their debut single, "Outta Gas"; its 1965 follow-up, "I Live for the Sun," was the band's breakthrough hit, reaching the US Top 50. "Andrea" was an even bigger hit, serving as the title track of the group's 1966 debut LP; although "Still" was also successful, subsequent singles including "I Look Baby I Can't See" and "Hi, How Are You?" met commercial resistance, and in the wake of 1967's "Loaded With Love" the Sunrays disbanded. Henn later went on to compose material with Brian Wilson.

All Music Album Review (by Stewart Mason):

A near-complete collection of everything the Sunrays ever recorded, including a 1996 reunion track ("Longboards Rule"), this is the only collection you'll ever need by this third-string surf group. The Sunrays are historically important only for the curiosity value of the fact that their manager was Murry Wilson, who assembled the group out of spite after he was relieved of his duties as the Beach Boys' manager. Unfortunately, Wilson didn't realize that surf music was pretty much over by early 1965 when the earliest Sunrays tracks were released, or that surf-inflected renditions of blues classics like Willie Dixon's "Seventh Son" were not a very good idea. There are a few really nice tracks here, particularly the semi-hit "Andrea" and the folk-rocking "Don't Take Yourself Too Seriously," but this set only proves that the Sunrays were only marginally talented, and many of these 58 tracks are simply filler at best. For Collectors Only is, for once, honestly titled: This set is only for surf historians.
