10,000 Years Later Between Venus and Mars, is a progressive rock album, by Portuguese musician José Cid, released on 15 May 1978. It is a spacey symphonic rock trip into outer space, dominated by Mellotron, string synth, and other synthesizers, with supporting use of guitars, bass, and drums.

The album is consistently featured in progarchives among the top five progressive rock albums of 1978, and considered "Essential: a masterpiece of progressive rock music".
Based on the growing science fiction trend, the concept for the album was that, 10.000 years after mankind's self-destruction, a man and a woman travelling in space return to Earth to repopulate it. The tone of the lyrics is of contemplation over mankind's past mistakes and future hopes. Cid's musical style on the record is very similar to the French take on symphonic rock with lots of string synths, Mellotron and a very simple melodic style. Lyrics are sung in native Portuguese. Most of the songs, influenced by a sort of mix combining The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd psychedelia, were composed by Cid, some of them with the help of guitar player Mike Sergeant and drummer Ramon Galarza.
