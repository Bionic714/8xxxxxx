     NOTE:

Somehow, after 40 years of issuing LPs, quirk-pop brother duo Sparks recently realized that they had actually never managed to issue a live album, but the outfit will rectify the discography oversight soon when they deliver their first official concert set, Two Hands One Mouth: Live in Europe.
 The two-disc collection features performances recorded last year during a European tour. The trip was the first brothers Ron and Russell Mael undertook without a full band or with computer backups, a feat reflected in the self-aware title (keyboardist Ron is the "two hands", while vocalist Russell is the "mouth"). The band wrote that the experience thus far has been "exceptional".
 "While we began the tour with certain fears of not having the safety net of a band or computers,we soon realized that the format was wildly successful (for us and for the audience) in highlighting in the purest form the core elements of what Sparks has always been - our musical world conveyed through our songs and our vocals and performed in a most aggressive way", they said in a statement. "What seemed to always set us apart was, we think, made emphatic in this format".
