I will be naming the files MXGP in the future. "
,Dixie12,2013-04-23T03:20Z,"Even if the sound is a bit sketchy and possibly irritating, I still love these downloads.  Thanks for working on the sound and for the head's up that they'll be titled mxgp in the future.  Really do enjoy these and appreciate your efforts in up loading them.   Now, finally there is something really good about Mondays!!
Thanks!"
,Dirtfrog399,2013-04-23T17:00Z,Thanks Dixie12 - apreciate the feedback. :-)
,RastaManZA,2013-04-24T12:44Z,"Thanks for your efforts Dirtfrog399, much appreciated. Just a question - Is this the highest resolution they show on MX-Life? Was thinking of paying but not if this is the best quality they offer."
,RastaManZA,2013-04-24T14:11Z,"^^ Ignore my last question, the quality is excellent!"
,Dirtfrog399,2013-04-24T17:17Z,"RastaManZA - I have the highest resolution available but on the live show I still get lower resolution on parts. 
Annoying but nothing I can do about it. "
