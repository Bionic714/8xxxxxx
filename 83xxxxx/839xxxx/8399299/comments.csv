,twijjit,2013-04-24T11:30Z,"Ahh. Spoke too soon on the other torrent. Yay! I'll be willing to seed this once it's finished and give feedback after I find out if it'll be worth my time to take my primary machine offline for a while.

Would anyone else care to provide some feedback on this? Is it based on the original ""8"", well enough that I can use Windows 8 drivers on it? I'd prefer to go back to 7, but they don't make Win7 drivers for the hardware in my HP Envy. :("

Hi, u see that on your HP ENVY, it comes pre-loaded with Windows 8 as well as its drivers (in SwSetup folder) it is useless to upgrade to this OS from your original registered Win8.
U might prefer to upgrade to Windows 8.1 as it launches on the month of june."

,twijjit,2013-05-25T02:30Z,"@cyberdoc - the serial number (and other instructions) are posted above. I missed them too, my first time around.

@maha - my idea was to install Win7 on the Envy, not this torrent... but you're likely right anyway. For this particular computer, I think I'd prefer doing things the right way, as I don't completely trust my restore discs (haven't used them yet.)

However, I just tried this version of Windows Blue on another computer. So far, disappointing. (Stats: x64, 3GHz dual core, 4G ram, 320G drive) - tried upgrading from Win7 to this by running it in Windows. It gave me the option to ""Keep my settings"", but I chose whatever the other one was - presumably clean install.

But it froze at ""Finalizing Settings"" for about 2 hours. Rebooted, said ""Restoring Previous Version of Windows"" - hmm. So either it didn't do a clean install, or it ""moved"" my old copy of windows somewhere where it could still be retrieved. 

I'm trying again by running setup ""at boot"". If everything works out, I'll report back.. but even then I have no intention of keeping it, because if I had it my way, all my computers for the rest of my life would run Windows 7, or until MS fixes what they completely destroyed. (My opinion, not yours, flame on. :P )"
