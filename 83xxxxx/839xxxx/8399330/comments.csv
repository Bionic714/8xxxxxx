Virus Total (Files themselves and URL) and Bitdefender read it as clean.
Hotspot Shield didn't warn me of anything.

Installed with no hassle! :)

Registered with the LIC included and it registered in an instant.

Recorded with it, uploaded a test video to youtube and it works.

Dxtory is a movie capture tool only for DirextX/OpenGL application.

Non-deteriorated Capture::
The codec of Dxtory can record original pixel data as it is. A quality can be pursued to a limit with video source without degradation.

Distribution HDD Writing::
The bottleneck of No. 1 of the speed of capture is a write-in speed to HDD.
If it is the environment of two or more HDD, this function will accelerate writing speed.

Dual Audio Recording::
If there are two or more audio input devices, two sound sources are recordable, like game sound and mic input.
It is possible to edit it individually later because it is preserved respectively as an independent stream in AVI file."
