What's cool about it:

Randomly generated dungeons, quests, items, and four difficulty
levels assure an exceptionally high replayability value.

Polished and rewarding cooperative mode lets you enjoy the entire
game with up to three of your friends at once.

Four classes to choose from (warrior, wizard, thief and monk),
each offering a unique gameplay style.



Overview:

The world is living under the dark shadow of a nefarious dragon.
Villagers are turning into stone. Armies of skeletons, swarms of
wasps, and lumbering ogres lurk everywhere. Evil is spreading like
wildfire. And you're the only one who can put an end to it.

Scattered across the kingdom are seven ancient major crystals which
together invoke the power of the Orb. Without it, you have no hope
of defeating your fire-breathing nemesis. You will creep through
dungeons and castles, explore the wilderness, encounter traps, curses,
and puzzles on your quest to unearth the crystals. It may take months.
It may take years. It may take away any hope you ever had of living a
normal, productive, twentieth-century life.

Darkstone is a classic hack'n'slash game with everything a good game of
its kind should have: randomly generated loot, four character classes,
a well-implemented cooperative mode, and four difficulty levels that use
the well-known Diablo-style formula of each level being the possibility
of further progression for you character. In addition, the game mechanics
are extremely smooth and fluent. Bottom line, if you feel like killing
some evil monsters and save the world in the process you canΓÇÖt possibly
go wrong with Darkstone.
