PdfCompress is a Mac OS X utility for reducing the size of PDF files. Just drop your file on the PdfCompress icon and it will quickly create a new, compressed PDF file suitable for sending via e-mail or posting on the Web. PdfCompress features a wide variety of compression methods (including LZW, Flate, JPEG, JPEG2000, font removal, CCITTT Group 4, dead-object stripping, metadata removal) and automaticallly chooses the most appropriate options for your file, yielding compression ratios of up to 10x or more for a wide variety of files. We do recommend you try PdfCompress with your files before you buy a license, as compression varies due not least to fundamental axioms of information theory not all files can be compressed. PdfCompress never modifies your original file, and always names result files in a manner that indicates they've been compressed, so you can be sure that your data is safe and you won't send or post the wrong file accidentally.
