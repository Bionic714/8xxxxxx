,nikita_ka,2013-04-22T19:09Z,BootCD image only! With universal restore. Last official version.
,bert16,2013-04-23T20:55Z,What difference is there between this one and Acronis 2013 16.0.6514 Plus Pak? As far as I know they're both BootCD's only. 
,nikita_ka,2013-04-23T22:07Z,"No. At first-both apps have bootcd as option to main program. BootCd is service tool. Main functional and version differense is all in desktop apps.
Plus pack is mostly for home use. It has simpler interface than Backup & Recovery. Backup & Recovery is like advanced version of True Image. To see complete difference go to acronis.com"
