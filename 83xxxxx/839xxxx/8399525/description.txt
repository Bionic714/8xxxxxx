Overview:
The most challenging game on Earth comes to life in Battle Chess. An entire medieval world at war is reflected on the checkered field.

Everyone who's ever had a knight take a pawn, has seen that capture as more than one piece replacing another on the board. In players' minds, the bold knight, resplendent in his armor of silver or ebon, sallies forth and slays the foul foot soldier. Combat, mortal combat, lies in the heart and soul of chess, but this aspect of it could only live in the mind's eye ΓÇô until now!

The Battle Chess Special Edition contains three different games, each with it's own unique gameplay, so you can experience the mortal combat thrill of chess more intensely than you ever imagined! Chess is no longer an abstract mental exercise. It is an entertainment that will prove the words of the famous Oriental Philosopher Chef Kung Pao who said - "War is fun!" 

It took 2000 years for someone to make chess better!
