What's cool about it:
Action-driven, fast-paced classic arcade gameplay
A mix of tactical insight and fast reflexes required, a good micro would be a plus
War has never been so much fun!
Overview:
Don't wait till you see the whites of their eyes...
Don't kid yourself it will be over by Christmas...
Don't try to shut out the screams...
And don't forget to wash your hands afterwards...

From a queue of some 360 "eager" conscripts waiting to go to war, a team of up to six will "volunteer" for each new mission. Encourage your soldiers to shoot anything that moves, throw grenades, fire bazookas, drive tanks, fly choppers, split up and do their own thing... and die... Guide your no-hoper's troop straight trough deadly missions. And if you lose some of them? There's more where that came from...
