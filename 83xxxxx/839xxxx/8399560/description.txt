What's cool about it:
The most legendary first person perspective shooter featuring Duke Nukem, one of the most iconic characters of all time
Memorable, cheesy and just plain awesome one-liners
A wide variety of weapons, including the Shrink Ray and DukeΓÇÖs Mighty Foot
Overview:
Duke Nukem, the politically incorrect celebrity and ultimate alien ass kicker, defends Earth and its babes from alien invasion. 
He is a can-do hero who realizes that sometimes innocent people have to die in order to save Earth, so accuracy of gun fire is not a real concern to him. This is the award-winning game that helped define the FPS genre and introduced unparalleled interactivity and a talking main character. 

Take the fight to the aliens in Hollywood, Los Angeles, a moon base and alien spacecraft. Defeat the aliens, so Duke can get back to some R&R with a stogie, a warm belly and a bottle of Jack.

Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition is the DRM-Free version of this legendary shooter. It includes the fourth bonus episode, a new weapon, and enemies. On top of that, we give you over a 100 free Duke Nukem 3D ringtones, as an extra bonus!
