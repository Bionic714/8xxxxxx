Overview:
Dive into epic RPG adventure with this acclaimed series of four classics. They will take you back to a time when RPGΓÇÖs were truly challenging and, because of this, very rewarding games. By finishing one, you felt like you have really accomplished something. Those were the times where games didnΓÇÖt lead you by hand with a big, red dot on your minimap or a huge arrow above your head. Many have failed in completing those games without help from a guide or a walkthrough, but those who accomplished this quest can be proud of it because here, being a hero really means something.

Each part of the series features very interesting and well told story. The combat is intuitive and fast, and the game mechanics are very easy to get into. So, if you want to test your cRPG skills or find out how they made games back then, this series is an excellent place to start your journey.
