cracked ??? "
,sonic30,2013-04-22T21:08Z,Its a one time purchase of 15 Dollar. The game features an offline mode for single player like the old Diablos or Torchlights. 
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-22T22:48Z,seed please
,Indrygo,2013-04-22T23:50Z,Sorry but is this real ? Since the game releases in late May next month >.< .
,Vanellyna,2013-04-23T02:42Z,Thanx! Cool game!
,Dimmis80,2013-04-23T14:49Z,Hey guys.Anyone from the seeders can post about if this is the real deal or not.!?Any comments guys.??
,pairet89,2013-04-23T15:41Z,It's the real game. It's the beta version
,ChiliNoMoreX,2013-04-23T19:28Z,"this relese is misleading since it's not written anywhere that it's a closed-beta.

but nice upload with great speed anyway."
,babygotback,2013-04-23T20:39Z,So if its closed beta but will I be able to play?
,pairet89,2013-04-23T22:22Z,"Yes, single player is working. I don't know if there are any bugs though. Since is beta it should have plenty of them"
,GObonzo,2013-04-24T12:52Z,"bad job for compression. not worried about saving size anymore people, just quick installation."
[V],7,2013-04-24T15:25Z,"lol at all the critics here . no one has even uploaded one single torrent and I m pretty sure most of them will not seed anything that they download. 
At least their comments are amusing."
,babygotback,2013-04-24T17:22Z,"So this is beta, but it contains full single player or is it somth more like demo?"
,GObonzo,2013-04-24T23:15Z,demo ends at end of first stage. a door that won't open. was the crack supposed to change this?
,GObonzo,2013-04-25T08:18Z,
,GObonzo,2013-04-25T08:35Z,"game is great and this upload works fine, only crashed once through entire demo. BUT, are we really stuck at the end of 1st stage or is this ""cracked""? 6+GB seems like a big file for only 1 stage."
,Dimmis80,2013-04-25T13:32Z,"@GObonzo i will try later the game and post later about that thing u said.Btw it might be a Beta bug or something.!!And is it better from Diablo 3.This is a hack an slash game.??

PS:It goes very slow a few seeders and it will take some time for me to have it.!"
,GObonzo,2013-04-25T14:28Z,"much better than Diablo 3. more like Torchlight games, but more ""adult"" seeming.
i know for a fact the Beta ends at the locked door at the end of stage 1 because i had already played it. i want to know if it has been cracked yet."
,GObonzo,2013-04-25T15:48Z,"settings can be changed in some of the Cfg files. like, is_preview_build=0 or 1 and other quest files you can change from inactive to active but none i have found so far that effect the door opening. how come no one gives a damn about this badass game? come on SCENE, fuck Riptide. get this bitch working."
,Eldriken,2013-04-25T17:23Z,"I sure hope there's a way to get the full game unlocked. Downloading a 7GB file for one stage would kinda suck.

We'll just have to give it time, I suppose. I can wait."
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-25T20:31Z,lol wtf is the point of posting this if its 1 demo level? take this shit down
,GObonzo,2013-04-25T20:40Z,damn tryin to read posts on tpb is annoying. what is the deal with them not displaying these past couple years?
,GObonzo,2013-04-26T04:43Z,"point of posting it would be so people could try the early level of this badass game. mislabeling it the way ""7"" has is just leading people to believe it's the full game.   
don't ever trust these things work or are what they say even if it's from a skulled uploader. they seem to never try out shit before uploading. just want to be the 1st for some popularity contest or something."
[V],7,2013-04-27T14:39Z,"GObonzo
It was all there in the description. Its not my fault TPB has been left by the admins to be full of bugs that mess out the uploads. Not to mention the fact that you cant edit your torrents witch is ridiculous.
Anyway you can read on my first comment here on the first line 
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing is an upcoming action-RPG focusing....
were upcoming is the key word.

,mony2018,2013-05-04T19:19Z, Thanx! Cool game! 
,yellow_virus,2013-05-18T13:51Z,"ty a lot for the upload, its truly sad the amount of crap some people say here on the comments, such an ungrateful bunch..."
,Suenami,2013-05-22T23:03Z,"This game is 20GB . It`s just 13.49 on Steam and it`s brilliant . You guys should buy it cuz this is only BETA - version .



"
,ArkAngel666,2013-05-22T23:26Z,Scene releases of the full version are up now... 20GB's? All I'm seeing is releases of around 9GB's...
