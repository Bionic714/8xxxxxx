First of all, if you can buy this books by some reasonable price, please do so. No, I'm not a hypocrite, but you see, I live in a country where just the shipping of this books from the UK would cost me almost the three times of the price of a single book. 

These books were all downloaded from the beloved Demonoid website who sadly is no more. This whole collection has been gathered book by book by me, BUT, I cannot stress enough how thankful I am to the man who uploaded all this books to Demonoid. Undead, if you are reading this, I just want to tell you that you have my eternal gratitude. Of course, we can not forget Red Dwarf, the guy who scanned and proofed all this books.

Blood for the Blood God!
