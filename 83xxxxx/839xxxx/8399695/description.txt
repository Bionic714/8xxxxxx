Whats New: 

* Give Alfred's Auto Updater its own tab with change log

* Migrate user set hotkeys and keywords when updating a workflow

* Make no results from a script filter correctly fall back to fallbacks

* Make the script filter item uid attribute optional, and generate a UUID 
  for these instead. This prevents Alfred from learning the returned 
  result order so will respect the XML returned order

* Sort saved workflow [input] objects based on y position for more
   predictable initial no-knowledge ordering

* Add hidden knowledge for placeholder items - Allows for web 
  searches / workflows to be ranked higher in the default results
 
* better logic on alternative modifiers, allows default mod actions on 
  invalid results

* Respect opening contacts metadata files in Alfred's contact viewer if 
  setup

*  Don't show "View contact in Alfred' subtext for non Powerpack
   users

* Capitalise Finder in 'reveal file in finder' modifier press subtext

* Fix spelling mistake 'searchces' when deleting a custom search

* Add option to escape backslashes in {query} for scripting
 
* default backslash escaping for script workflow templates and 
  examples

* When using cmd+c on a contact in Alfred's results, copy the name
   rather than the contact id

* Reset iTunes mini player if node stack typed mismatch, prevents nil
   caused double characters

* Add placeholder AppleScript for NSAppleScript configuration
   window with no AppleScript

* improve "Open With" matching to use kMDItemKeywords fields
   which also match app char names from 10.8.3

* fix issue with typed word not showing with define keyword in certain
   scenarios

* Add and improve timer logging for better performance profiling

* Change resizing mode on snippets table in prefs to make more useful

* If cmd+down on file, navigate into the containing folder

* Show reason sheet why non-PP users can't import themes or 
  workflows rather than just not doing anything

* More efficient eject workflow which only loads the volumes if it 
  needs to

* Don't great out advanced 'sync' button for non-Powerpack users, 
  instead, explain Powerpack is needed

* Rename 'Update" to "Save" in the workflows detail editor to prevent
   confusion

* If a person is marked as a company, then prefix with the company in 
  Alfred's results

* Add in support for Mailplane 3 email attachments

* Trim large type text to ensure there are no hanging characters before
  displaying

* More clear 'grey out' behavior for alt connection sheet when selecting 
  'none' as the connection modifier

* show full path at bottom of recent documents window

* Add type to filter documents in the recent documents action

* Fix some text in the v1 import sheet

* Switch out some unused NSLogs

* Add resilience against certain Address Book scenarios

* Move application file cache database into app support folder to 
  prevent auto cache cleaner apps from breaking or slowing Alfred

* Fix issue where joining comments and keywords in the app cache 
  caused a selector not found when assuming an id was an array

* More robust default browser selection when populating browser info
  into workflow object config browser selection

  general prefs
