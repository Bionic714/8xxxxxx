,darcon9672,2013-04-22T22:56Z,loadstone2k12  I would just like to say thank you. When this season started I d/led around 15 other releases and they all had their flaws  then i found yours  6 channels with the subs hardcoded great work. I was wondering if you had seasons 1&2 with the same great quality. The ones I have are not as good as yours. some are missing subs or subs are separate files which is a pain. thanks
