Fish Out Of Water is the story of six feisty fish longing to soar above the ocean and see the world from a whole new perspective. To help them get airborne, players simply throw their fish of choice right out of the water and watch as it flies through the clouds and skips merrily along the waves. But thereΓÇÖs a lot more to this adventure under the surface!

Players will have to battle the elements and choose their throw wisely as the weather changes hourly. Expect the unexpected with crazy tsunamis, icebergs and even an immense jellyfish swarm!

After three throws, the Crab Crew will score your overall performance, and thatΓÇÖs where the competition really heats up! Players can compete in daily league score competitions with their friends and monitor their level progress. As different objectives are completed, players level up and unlock charms which can be crafted to unleash awesome bonus powers at the start of each game!
