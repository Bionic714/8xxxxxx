,nazthegreat1,2013-04-22T23:03Z,"I would love to be able to watch this before 2014, SEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"

,t830king,2013-04-23T00:41Z,awsome movie tnx for upload and pls more seed ^_^
,humpahoe,2013-04-23T05:34Z,SEE FUCKHEADS!
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-04-23T08:40Z,I don't think those who never upload anything ever should complain so much about seeding. If other leechers don't share there is nothing the uploader can do.
,nagydeak,2013-04-23T08:57Z,was about to upload this myself. nice to see someone else saw this cool movie. seeding!
,humpahoe,2013-04-23T13:49Z,"I will seed. I always do up to a week after getting anything, but I have to be able to get it first."
,Erik_O,2013-04-23T18:49Z,of course i seed but this is stuck 14% for me.... why upload if you don't want to seed????
,humpahoe,2013-04-23T23:26Z,FUCK this is frustrating. WTF PEOPLE
,nazthegreat1,2013-04-24T01:48Z,"Ive been trying to DL this since 4 minutes after it was uploaded. I would seed, if it ever finishes... Been stuck at 30% for a while now..."
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-04-24T02:30Z,"Not much one can say when there are 980  peers and you are having slow download speeds. If everyone does not share with at least some semblance of speed then it will go slowly. Just be patient, and it will finish someday, hopefully.   "
,gthtdjlckjd,2013-04-24T04:59Z,":( Yep, some day... almost 2 days my pc's on, but only 40%. It's the first time since I have a torrent client, actually. Instead GBs, it's 0,1 - 10 KBs.
It'll take much patience. Well, but I still wait... miracle:):):)"
,cindy25,2013-04-24T05:10Z,I the problem is its too big.  a 700MB file would have been easier for everyone
,cindy25,2013-04-24T05:38Z,"there are so many people looking for Hallmark and Lifetime movies.  please , anyone, consider uploading (700MB version) preferred"
,gthtdjlckjd,2013-04-24T14:48Z,Yes!!!! Done!!! I'm seeding!
,humpahoe,2013-04-24T19:19Z,mother of God! Yes!!!!!!!!!!!
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-04-24T20:06Z,People need to be more patient. It took a year to get all the seasons of ER in 720p. It was worth the wait. Who wants to watch in crappy SD or compressed beyond belief. Not on your life on a large screen or even a 17 inch laptop. The motto should be 720p or 1080p ONLY!!!!
,nazthegreat1,2013-04-24T20:37Z,Seeding. A10/V8... Im not sure if its just my laptop but the movie is kind of... frizzy? The resolution is great though! THANK YOU!
,jungcookie,2013-04-27T02:35Z,"Thank you for UL this. Really need Hallmark fix!!!

@cindy25 thanks for letting us know about this one:)"
,RW-EXplosion,2013-05-27T21:26Z,"A 7
V 8 - really good for a TV rip
thank you."
