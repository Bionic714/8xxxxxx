What's cool about it:
Thrilling and chilling horror atmosphere
An interesting storyline with a wicked twist
A truly oldschool game for the die-hard adventure fans
Overview:
There's something very strange going on. It's as if you are living through your worst nightmare and unable to wake up. Won't anyone let you in on the terrible secret that haunts your walking moments.

Why has Jimmy Blandford taken to drinking - has he experienced the powerful forces of darkness? Why has your father, the dutiful local Vicar, neglected his parish without any apparent reason? Why did your mother invite you to stay for the weekend, then disappear without a word?

What unspeakable horrors await you behind the closed doors of the old burnt out manor house? Are you ready to meet a vampire and do battle with a crazed hound sent straight from hell? Are you ready to be terrified beyond your wildest dreams?

Don't even try to wake up. It's your very own Personal Nightmare...
