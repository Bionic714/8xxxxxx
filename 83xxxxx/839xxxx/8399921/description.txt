What's cool about it:
Includes the original game Realms of Arkania: Blade of Destiny and its sequel Realms of Arkania 2: Star Trail
Based upon a well-established pen & paper RPG system The Dark Eye
Complex underlying mechanics for the serious role-playing game fan
Overview:
An epic RPG based on the popular German paper & pencil series, "Das Schwarze Auge" (The Dark Eye). Games that draw you in so deeply that the hours slip by like minutes.

The atmospheric old-school feel, interesting game system and character development are fun, but the real strength of this games lies in their cool dungeons, which are chock full of tricks, traps, puzzles, and side events to keep you occupied for a long, long time.
