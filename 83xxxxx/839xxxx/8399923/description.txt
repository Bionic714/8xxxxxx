What's cool about it:
Old-school first person shooter with an arcade feel
Fire, explosions, gore and gibs all over the place!
Cool weapons, including the drunk missile launcher, Excalibat and the Hand of God
Overview:
You are part of an elite group of operatives called HUNT (High-risk United Nations Taskforce), and you must stop a maniac cult leader from killing millions of people. While scouting a remote island, you are suddenly surrounded by enemy troops with guns blaring. In the distance you see your boat - your only chance to escape - blown to matchsticks. In front of you is a huge fortress monastery, and your only chance to stop the madness.

You are equipped with awesome, high-tech weaponry like heat-seeking missiles, split missiles and the Flamewall cannon, which leaves a trail of charred skeletons in its wake. It's your assignment to annihilate and destroy - to ensure peace on Earth.
