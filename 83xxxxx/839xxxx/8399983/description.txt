What's cool about it:
The funniest fantasy adventure game ever created
Crazy yet logical puzzles
Countless references to popular fantasy works
Overview:
There are some things that kids just shouldn't have to put up with. Being transported to some weird dimension full of goblins, dwarves, swamplings, stupid wizards and sleeping giants is definitely one of them. 

When Simon discovers the tuneless bard, the repulsive Rapunzel and a pair of demons with a serious attitude problem, it could just prove to be one clich√© too far.

With a Nobel prize for attempted humour and puzzles so fiendish you'll certainly need help from the wise owl, Simon the Sorcerer is guaranteed to provide a distraction from the drudgery of modern life.

You can choose between subtitled and full talkie version of the game.
