What's cool about it:
Countless references to popular fantasy works
Witty dialog lines and memorable characters
If you liked the first Simon the Sorcerer, you will love this one!
Overview:
Just when he thought his life was regaining some resemblance of normality, Simon's wonder years are once again turned upside down. The evil wizard Sordid returns from the grave with only one thing on his mind - revenge! 

Journey with Simon through this sequel to Simon the Sorcerer, as he manages once more to get stuck in a land of twisted fairy tales, recycled gags and carbon dated clich√©s!

With a cast of thousands (woodworms, mostly) and enough Swampling Stew to keep an underprivileged country sick for a year, this classic adventure will keep you well entertained until there'll be another sequel.

Welcome to the world of Simon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe.

This is full talkie version of the game. You can turn the subtitles on or off by pressing "T" during the gameplay.
