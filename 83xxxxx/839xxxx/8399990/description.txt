Overview:
Star Control 1
Mankind is about to be wiped off the face of the galactic map. A savage clutch of alien races called the Ur-Quan Hierachy has become the ΓÇ£evil empireΓÇ¥ of the 27th century- ruthlessly invading interstellar neighbors. Humanity is next on their list. Your job is to make sure that they donΓÇÖt succeed. The entire Alliance of Free Stars battlefleet awaits your orders.

Star Control 2
Arguably the greatest space adventure on PC, with tons of humor and memorable characters. You start in a nearly empty space-ship, but as the game progresses, you can upgrade it with many modules that affect the vessel's attributes. You can discover new stars, meet new alien races, wage wars, and boldly go where no man has gone before you. A truly exceptional exploration game that that has influenced the entire industry. While playing this gem, it's really fun to observe how many of its gameplay features were copied by modern AAA titles.
