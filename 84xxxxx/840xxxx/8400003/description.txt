What's cool about it:
Highly customize gameplay with complex game mechanics
Six campaigns where you can play as a axis and allies
Play the whole WWII from the beginning to the very end
Overview:
Political options, research and upgrade of equipment, management of supply and resources and the strategic employment of one's armed forces are some of the keys to success.

With limited phase restrictions and wide open turns you are in complete control to try many different approaches and entertain just as many possible outcomes. The future of Europe and perhaps ultimate glory is in your hands.
