Overview:
Experience fantasy role-playingΓÇÖs most distinctive and award-winning series in this special three-game collection. Ultima: The Second Trilogy follows the spellbinding tale of the Avatar in this richly detailed and challenging story. The setting is medieval Britannia, but the stories are timeless and involve universal issues that explore the essence of virtue. First, there is the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment in Ultima IV, where your personal ethics are tested in a treacherous struggle to demonstrate the eight virtues of Avatarhood. Then in Ultima V, you rely on your new-found strengths and skills to oppose a tyrannical leader who warps the virtues you uphold through his twisted legislation of morality. Finally, in the epic concluding chapter of Ultima VI, you, the Avatar, must resolve the cultural conflict between a race of hostile creatures and your own. It all adds up to a relentless test of character in a world where things are not always as they appear, and evil is not easily defined.
