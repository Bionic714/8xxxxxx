What's cool about it:
Ultima 7 The Complete Edition includes: Ultima 7: The Black Gate, Ultima 7: Forge of Virtue, Ultima 7 Part Two: Serpent Isle, Ultima 7 Part Two: The Silver Seed.
Timeless classic with hundreds of hours of a top-notch gaming experience.
Created by Richard Garriott (Lord British) who stated that this part "was the most masterfully executed of the Ultima series."
Overview:
In the seventh installment of the Ultima series you ΓÇö the Avatar ΓÇö must go back to Britannia and investigate a series of strange events. Two hundred years have passed since your last visit and much has changed since then. An unknown being who calls himself the Guardian has appeared and is forcing everyone to bow to his whims. In addition magic doesn't work as it should, it seems that all of the mages have gone insane, and quiet towns are being terrorized with ritualized murders. It is unclear what is happening, but initial signs point to some kind of organization called the Fellowship. It is up to you to unravel the mystery and find out what is really going on in Britannia.

Ultima 7 is arguably one the best in the series. With enhanced graphics, sound, and controls it was a huge step forward not only for the series, but for the entire RPG genre. The level of immersion was astonishing at the time. Rich environments, wide-ranging dialog trees, and dynamic combat were all masterfully combined by a team that Lord British (Richard Garriott) led to create a game that can't be ignored by any cRPG fan.
