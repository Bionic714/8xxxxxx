,elDunge,2013-04-26T04:11Z,Are save game working on this one or should we still use the reloaded proper crack?
,elDunge,2013-04-26T04:25Z,Also why is the DLC nearly double the size of the original game?
,Spinereaper,2013-05-04T07:19Z,How do you exactly update the game? I put it in my Sacred Citadel program files but it doesnt work. I also tried to just start it up on the ISO location but nothing... Help?
