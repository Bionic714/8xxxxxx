Of my (3) double CD sets of Ellington small bands this is my favorite.

(24) of the (30) tracks include legendary bassist Jimmy Blanton in

mostly septets led by prominent Ellington sidemen.  Ellington participates

on all but (4) tracks.


This is one of many French JAZZ TRIBUNE (RCA) reissues.  An earlier

upload of mine was the "Complete young Oscar Peterson" in this same  

series of (2) CD sets.


The pics include somewhat high resolution jpegs of (4) page text foldouts

(appx 12MB of them) in French and English.  I needed a sheet of glass

to keep the page flat...zoom in to read the text as may be necessary


CD#2  track #1  SOME SATURDAY is good beyond hyperbole..or as Edward

himself would put it, "beyond category.
