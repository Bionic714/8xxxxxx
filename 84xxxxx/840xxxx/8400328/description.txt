Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, April 22 broadcast of Infowars Live, Alex Jones crashes through the lies of the Boston bombing narrative weaved to intentionally cause confusion and drum up support for a further stripping away of civil liberties. 

Alex also exposes what the other hand is doing while public attention focuses on a made-for-tv drama-like story being persistently waved in our faces. 

On today's show, investigative journalist and author Wayne Madsen stops by to discuss the multiple red herrings in play in the wake of the botched Boston Marathon bombing operation. 

Founder and chief editor of World Affairs Brief Joel Skousen also talks to Alex about the history of manufactured terror and how governments frequently employ this tried and true technique to enslave populations.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
