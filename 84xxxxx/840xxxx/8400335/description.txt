Carb Back-Loading by: John Kiefer

Be honest: do you live like a monk?

I did. I watched everything I put in my mouth and my eating schedule displayed Swiss-precision timing. I would never eat the foods I loved ΓÇö like the cherry turnover above ΓÇö and I never dared miss a feeding, fearing the rumble, irritability and nausea of an empty stomach. In shortΓÇª

On top of that, I trained for hours a day and I never looked anything like I do now.

These days, I only get to the gym three times a week if IΓÇÖm lucky. IΓÇÖm building a business and working with athletes across the globe. I donΓÇÖt have time to spare.

But I found a way to look awesome anyway.

My background as a physicist keeps me hungry for knowledge. IΓÇÖm always reading a medical journal to stay on top of my game and while researching a random vein of interestΓÇª

I stumbled upon an integral component of the way to stay lean and enhance every aspect of training ΓÇö strength, size, aesthetics ΓÇö with almost no effort.

I donΓÇÖt eat on a schedule anymore. I make gains in the gym with little effort, even training a total of 3 hours a week; I eat cherry turnovers, hamburgers and fries, ice cream and cheesecake and guess what?

After spending a few years perfecting the eating strategy, I finally put it all into a single book with everything you need to live like you want, enjoy life and look like a fitness model all year, while still achieving new goals in the gym.

And thatΓÇÖs it. ThatΓÇÖs all I have to tell you. Everything you could want is in the book. ItΓÇÖs one of the most heavily researched and referenced diet books in the world, bar none. My only goal for this book is to help people learn my supposed secret:

You can read on if youΓÇÖd like and see testimonials from world-record holding powerlifters, internationally ranked female athletes, the editor of MenΓÇÖs Fitness Magazine and even the average person who just wanted to look awesome naked. But if youΓÇÖre ready to make your friends envious, to make life simple and reveal the chiseled comic-book-character physique thatΓÇÖs hiding under a layer of fat, then why wait?
