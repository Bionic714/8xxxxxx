,TNBG,2013-04-23T05:14Z,Thanks I was wondering if it was counted correctly as I know sometimes Canadian broadcasts ignore/can't keep up with American broadcast changes.

,EpixStudios2013,2013-04-23T18:34Z,When are you uploading episode 22 ? I am really eager to view it A.S.A.P
,sounddd,2013-04-23T18:46Z,"No worries, though this might help someone out. I got a heads up thanks to /r/CastleTV on reddit, but a lot didn't."
,sounddd,2013-04-23T18:49Z,"*thought, sorry"
,teegly,2013-04-24T12:22Z,"This is indeed episode S05E21 and not 22.
 It's called ""The Squab & the Quail"""
