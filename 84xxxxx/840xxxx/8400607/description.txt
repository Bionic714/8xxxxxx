16:40 ΓÇô Watch my strong eye contact
16:56 ΓÇô Have strong contact: piercing her soul with my eyes
17:12 ΓÇô Shows youΓÇÖre a more dominant person, which girls love
17:50 ΓÇô Sexual Joke: like to throw it out and see how she reacts

18:23 ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt revert back to safe mode
18:34 ΓÇô Playing it safe fucks you over
18:42 ΓÇô Always continue something that makes you both feel good
18:59 ΓÇô She said, ΓÇ£she has to go.ΓÇ¥ donΓÇÖt go with that statement
19:07 ΓÇô Based on her tonality, sheΓÇÖs down for anything
19:21 ΓÇô DonΓÇÖt acknowledge how obvious her behavior is because it can actually ruin things
19:25 ΓÇô She wants to be there, but society says that this interaction isnΓÇÖt normal
19:42 ΓÇô Up to me to make her feel comfortable to continue the conversation
20:20 ΓÇô She avoids the question: but is still not leaving
20:31 ΓÇô Body language that tells you that she doesnΓÇÖt want to leave
20:46 ΓÇô Common mistake: guys will ask way too much if she wants to still go on the date
20:51 ΓÇô Why ask something that she dissuades / ignores
21:01 ΓÇô Bring it up another time, but in a different way
21:25 ΓÇô Look how I ask: try different angles
21:41 ΓÇô If she says no, try to figure out: ΓÇ£why is she saying no?ΓÇ¥
21:48 ΓÇô In this case she was down, but not that comfortableΓÇª yet
21:59 ΓÇô Try again later
22:11 ΓÇô Come to a conclusion to why she said: think, act, make a decision
23:52 ΓÇô Everything sheΓÇÖs acting says, ΓÇ£sheΓÇÖs down to be persuadedΓÇ¥
24:11 ΓÇô How do I persuade her now?
24:15 ΓÇô The key to sexual humor: it must be done in strides
24:35 ΓÇô Find the green light verbally and make the sub- communication of sexual things
25:12 ΓÇô Now IΓÇÖm calling her a prostitute
25:21 ΓÇô Figure out if you can keep going with the jokes
25:32 ΓÇô Vulgar jokes can make you seem ballsy, IF sheΓÇÖs okay with the joke
26:32 ΓÇô Ask her out again, but she says ΓÇ£noΓÇ¥ in a very unsure way
26:40 ΓÇô This means I should just keep trying
26:59 ΓÇô She says a few things that want to make sure she doesnΓÇÖt sound easy
27:18 ΓÇô I donΓÇÖt want to go shopping with girls
27:27 ΓÇô Be dominant so be 100% sure that sheΓÇÖll get coffee with meΓÇª.
28:59 ΓÇô I use the 90/10 rule
29:11 ΓÇô It works
29:18 ΓÇô Shows that I unique, quirky, and she likes that
29:21 ΓÇô Was not deterred by her objections
29:31 ΓÇô We go out on a date
29:39 ΓÇô We make out during the day
29:47 ΓÇô This wouldΓÇÖve never happened if I didnΓÇÖt give in on her initial resistance
29:56 ΓÇô The next time she says ΓÇ£No.ΓÇ¥ recognize if itΓÇÖs genuine
