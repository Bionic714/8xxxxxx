HoagieΓÇÖ is a collection of short films highlighting the city of Philadelphia, and the diversity of the people who live there. The five stories, written and directed individually by each member of Pennsylvania People, intertwine over the course of one night in The City of Brotherly Love. Although the city plays an important role in their lives, it is the men and women within it who make it so fascinating. As the audience experiences fast paced scenarios involving criminal hi jinks and a wild 21st birthday party, they are at the same time grounded by an awkward first date, an obsessive manΓÇÖs mysterious journey, and a chance meeting of two people who couldn't be more different.
