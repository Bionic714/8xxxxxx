BBC - Paul Hollywoods Bread S01E06 Enriched Breads [MP4-AAC](oan)
 
http://nimga.com/m/8TkVP.png

Paul Hollywood crosses the lines between bread, cake and pastry. He
shows how enriched breads can be a spectacular treat that deserve
their place at the heart of any celebration meal. Paul bakes his
impressive citrus flavoured, cranberry packed, Sicilian lemon and
orange bread with a sweet almond glaze and teaches a local baking
club the joy of baking a historic British classic, lardy cake.

Enjoying a little Scandinavian influence, he shares the secrets of
danish pastries, making deliciously tempting onion, mushroom and
emmental swirls and tucking into sweet Swedish Easter semlor buns
He rounds off with an utterly stunning savoury brioche crown - an
indulgent, enriched bread twisted into a circle, bursting with molten
mozzarella and parma ham and topped with a spicy pumpkin salad.
