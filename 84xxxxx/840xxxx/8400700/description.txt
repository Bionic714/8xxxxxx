"The Pathos in the Pathogens"

The Jeffersonian team rushes to
prevent a viral outbreak while
investigating the murder of
journalist Mia Garrett after her
infected body is found at a biohazard
facility. When the mutated virus that
killed Mia infects Jeffersonian
intern Arastoo Vaziri, their only
chance of saving him is by solving
the murder. Tension and passion build
as the team races against the clock
to find the killer - and the cure.
