,P_Greezy,2013-04-23T17:59Z,"Thanks for this game, just finished downloading! Gonna try overburning this game and see how it goes on lt 3.0"
,P_Greezy,2013-04-23T20:17Z,"Btw it stops at 99.9% it still works perfectly using OVERBURN method, thanks again! "
,Rubbebubbe,2013-04-23T20:18Z,"Thanks a bunch for this one. 
One question: this game wants to do a update on my system (I have LT 3.0 and dashboard 15574). Is it safe to do so?! I dont want my system to be f****d up  :-( 
Thanks in advance for your help."
,FireKnight70,2013-04-23T20:59Z,"@ Rubbebubbe... I just came on TPB for the same answer to your question...since there were none at the time I went ahead and accepted the update (holding my breathe in a very noobish way :D) I'm glad to report back to you and everyone else that the update was a SYSTEM update and it updated the dash (namely added some extra options on the dash) however it still played the game and didn't flash the drive from the game disc.  To double check, I had a back up of the game, ""Alan Wake"" and that also works!!!  So yes, it did update the dash, but games still work and I did have the same as you LT 3.0 and dashboard 15574.  Just wanted to help you and everyone else out as selecting ""YES"" to that update scared me LOL :D  Happy gaming and thanks to Drarbg for the upload!!!  (PS: game works 100%)...now off to playing :D"
,Rubbebubbe,2013-04-23T21:43Z,"Thank you so very much FireKnight70!
Then I will do what you´ve done  :-)"
,aisac007,2013-04-23T21:55Z,so slow... i really want to test this game
,FireKnight70,2013-04-23T22:30Z,"@ Rubbebubbe...May the force be...uhmmm, sorry wrong game XD  (anyway...good luck bud and enjoy the game!)"
,vinnievic86,2013-04-24T02:18Z,Works great.. Thanks.
,cinogen,2013-04-24T09:40Z,"lt 2.0 updated dash - still can play older games!
however - i get an unreadable disc on the game. burned with ihas - might just be a bad burn - dunno"
,FlyingPoo,2013-04-24T19:48Z,"I get to where you leave in the shuttle in the beginning, it plays the cut scene and then just sits at the loading screen FOREVER!"
,lakers2012,2013-04-24T22:21Z,Thanks for the game. Already burned it with clonecd using truncate method. Works perfectly. Great job
,Averad,2013-04-25T04:21Z,@_whoa_ stop going into every torrent and asking for 80 rar files no one needs the compressed rar files anymore torrent programs don't have an issue starting and stopping downloads.
,aisac007,2013-04-25T05:14Z,"so THATS why they compress things like that, so unconfortable"
,Dante_F,2013-04-25T22:53Z,"Suck game.
Kiepska gra. "
,Thargelios,2013-04-26T13:20Z,Tried with overburn and truncation. Didn't work for me. Looks like needs an ihas burner.
,JTaGRRRR,2013-04-27T00:44Z,"For all of you having burner issues, get a JTaG or RGH or try using/researching ""BurnerMAX Payload Tool v0.15"""
,favored4,2013-04-27T20:46Z,Please SEEED!!!! 0.5 to 2.0 kb/s!!!!
,favored4,2013-04-27T23:48Z,Why is this so freakin slow!!
,punkfreak123,2013-04-28T02:23Z,Works fine. Burned with burnermax Ihas B using Verbatim mkm 003 disc.
,favored4,2013-04-28T18:43Z,"I used the same methods, and it won't for me. I have an ihas and everything. What have I done wrong?"
