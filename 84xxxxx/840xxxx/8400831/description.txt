The Appleseed Cast: The Illumination Ritual

Change, as they say, is a good thing. And a lot has changed for Lawrence, Kansas, post-rock outfit The Appleseed Cast over the 14 years since their founding. With Illumination Ritual (out April 23rd), their first full-length since 2009ΓÇÖs Sagamartha & first output since 2011ΓÇÖs Middle States EP, theyΓÇÖve embraced not only a new line-up, but also hopscotching time signatures and a tumultuous anthemic energy that rivals anything else in their consistently impressive catalog.
