All Music Album Review (by Heather Phares):

Rhino's Surfin' Hits delivers exactly what its to-the-point title suggests, gathering 18 surf rock favorites like the Beach Boys' "Surfin' Safari" and "Surfin' U.S.A.," Dick Dale's "Miserlou," and the Surfaris' "Wipe Out." The collection gives equal time to both instrumental and vocal surf bands, featuring Jan & Dean's "Surf City" and "Ride the Wild Surf" alongside the Chantays' "Pipeline," the Marketts' "Surfer's Stomp," and the Bel Airs' "Mr. Moto." Though it's not a comprehensive overview of either kind of surf rock, Surfin' Hits does collect some of the best examples of both styles, and while it doesn't offer many surprises, it's consistently entertaining.
