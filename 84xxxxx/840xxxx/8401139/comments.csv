,childspirited,2013-04-23T21:21Z,I have RGH2 my BB 512MB Jasper and can do most things with a little guidance. I have never attempted to install avatar accessories since I do not care about them. My kids are now into that stuff and I would like to give them a great selection to choose from without messing up my system. I have just updated F3 to v735 and updated my kernel to 16203 as well as my systemupdate so avatars and kinect all work flawlessly. Any help on how to install the avatars would be great.
,aisac007,2013-04-23T21:35Z,"u cant mess up your system from installing avatar things, not even if u try.

what  have to do to install them (one method) is=

1- move your profile into an usb drive (u can do this in the storage settings of the oficial dash)
2- open ""Horizon"" and copy your XUID number (it is in the account editor tab)
3- either use ""360 content manager"" or ""Avatar XUID Patcher"" to patch the avatar items (that u uncompressed from this torrent)
4- use 360 content manager to upload them into ur xbox

it might sound complicated but its actually easy once u have your XUID number (thats whats link the items to your profile/s). u can find the programs either here on torrent or google them since they are like 2-5mb only.

a word of advice thou, this is a huge amount of items 10802 so expect some loading times while u upload them to ur xbox and use them, i tell u this so u dont shut it down thinking its hunged up or something.

fell free to ask if u encounter any problems"

,childspirited,2013-05-01T02:19Z,"A few more questions. After I patch them with multiple XUID's can I place them in a single folder so everyone can use them or do I have to place the same items in each individual folders for each profile? Where do I place them? How do I figure out which items I want and which items I do not want since they have no descriptions just code? Are all avatar awards included in this collection since us RGHers cannot access Live to receive our awards once unlocked? Lastly, with so many items, will it cause my system to crash a lot? Crash at all?

.....my apologies for so many questions, just never did this before."
,expokiki,2013-05-01T02:44Z,ok so here how you do it patch the avatar stuff by using the 360 manager and use horizon to place on hard drive ( do not rehash and resign) just save to your device and voila you done 
,aisac007,2013-05-06T21:50Z,"u can just use 360 manager to place them on your xbox using lan wired or wireless or whatever kind of connection u have between ur xbox and pc.

this contains everything BUT avatar rewards from games.

placing this items manually is nearly impossible since there are like a million folders to create and stuff.. so use xbox 360 manager, horizon or other program u like for placing this.

if u do not have a connection between ur pc and xbox (using for example freestyle dash 3), i recommend u make one since its the best way to upload stuff to ur xbox (games included). its quite easy and there are tons of tutorials on google, just search for freestyle dash 3"
