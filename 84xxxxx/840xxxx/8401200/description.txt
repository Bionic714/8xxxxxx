The third album from the discography of the very unique and poetic emcee, Illogic.
"But as far as Illogic's style goes, Illogic does it best". Those who are familiar with his work will undoubtedly enjoy this  album. If you are a hip-hop head who digs abstract, reflective, and thoughtful hip-hop, then this album is most certainly for you. Enjoy all, and seed this gem!
