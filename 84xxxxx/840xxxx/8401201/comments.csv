,steveh3088,2013-04-23T12:50Z,"I HAVE SOLVED 2 OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS TORRENT. slow speeds because of low seeds. ---right click properties of the dead island torrent and add to the tracker list, make sure to have  spaces in between. you can find these trackers at bitsnoop website /trackers
 i had a 100-200 kb per sec, then added a lot of trackers and it went up to 400 kb- 1.8 mb per second on and off.


NOW FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE CRASH---mine would crash right after it says ""failed to setup internet"" or something like that.
so at first i blocked the program in my firewall, didnt work, then turned off full screen, didnt work, then i went to settings, online, and changed it from cooperative to single player, now i do not get a crash.

First, go to the directory of your game install (default: C:Program Files (x86)Dead Island Riptide).

Second, right click ""DeadIslandGame_x86_rwdi.exe"", and click properties.

Finally, click the compatibility tab, and at the bottom it says: ""[ ] Run this program as an administrator.""  Click the check box next to it, then run it (or create a shortcut), and it should work!"

* If i try to save changed video settings, the game crashes

* Text missing. There is obviously something written in the confirmation dialogs, but it's invisible

* When I press ESC in-game, there are no options; basically, i can exit the game only by killing the task in TaskManager. Also, if I click around loosely, i get into some menus, but I couldn't find the ""QUIT"" button/option

This game is a travesty and easily the worst game of the year, Aliens Colonial Marines and Walking Dead Survival Instinct is better than this shit and those games are terrible.

,2Mike2,2013-04-27T00:08Z,"@vorzox

Something classified under Obfuscator just means that it was for code protection and not a trojan. They do this so other groups and or valve/developers cannot see how they made their crack and break it. 

If you don't trust me feel free to google what an Obfuscator does. "
,vorzox,2013-04-27T00:29Z,"@2Mike2@ 

While I appreciate the candor I simply copied a different steam_api.dll from another DL'ed torrent and the game ran fine.

On a different note.  The game (for whatever reason) doesn't save.  So the entire exercise was pretty pointless to begin with."

There is no stupid trojan or virus.  If you think there is then you obviously shouldn't be using torrents as you are very confused.

I am running this game on a i7, 12gb 1600 ram, x2 gtx 680's, sabertooth x58 m/b and it runs on max settings with zero hiccups or bugs.

,chriscrash,2013-04-28T00:26Z,amazing game!! works perfect!! thanks !!! 
,moeburn1,2013-04-28T01:03Z,"@anyone claiming this torrent, or other torrents, has a virus, also @anyone claiming it is false positive

You're both right.  Cracks often require virus-like memory access and disk writes, and heuristic anti-virus programs will often detect this as virus-like behaviour when it is in fact doing just what it is supposed to.

BUT, these torrents often DO have actual viruses added onto the crack and/or game, and can be detected by anti-virus scanners as actual known viruses, sometimes with virus ID names.  

So don't assume every time your AV detects a virus, that it is correct, because your AV might be mistaken.  But also, don't assume every virus detection is just a false-positive, it might not be.  
Some of these torrents have real viruses in them.

So far, the only way I've found that a moderate-expert PC user like me can check if the virus is real or just a false-positive is by running the suspicious program in Sandboxie, so that I can see if the program tries to do anything other than what it is supposed to.  "
,olekking,2013-04-28T01:38Z,"@Dinopoulos

You didn't experience the same problem as me, i have the screeching on the game menu and when i'm playing the game audio is low and there's a lot of distortion. This happens everywhere, all the time.
