[V],HeroMaster,2013-04-23T13:01Z,"Ok Guys we have notice that the game is not working for some people here and on private sites also so do not worry we have the solution to all things, here is how it goes:

1) Go to Options > Co-op/Online Tab > Turn off multiplayer and change to Single Player Only.

Seed and have fun Playing!"

,udeth,2013-04-23T17:34Z,changed online options still crashing at after picking character screen for me x64 win7 pro any help would be great!!! also seeding at 400k/b 
,Tsukichan,2013-04-23T18:27Z,"So I finished downloading the game while I slept, followed the instructions and launched it up. Set the mode to offline and it was seemingly running perfectly. However after the recap and opening scene, thats it. It starts to load up the prologue then crashes while doing it. If anyone finds a solution, tell everyone!"
,xxela,2013-04-23T19:15Z,"@udeth, @Tsukichan  I got the same crash so I download another torrent that it worked for me. Strange because HeroMaster torrents always worked. So try this, is also smaller

,NikolaTesla1,2013-04-23T20:23Z,"CRASHING ON START!! IMm changed from multiplayer to single player, but still crashing> ANY FIX???"
,Adonii22,2013-04-23T20:49Z,The Game Works But Once The Whole First Cut Scene With The People On The Shit It Just Crashes Even When You Try To Skip It It Crashes =/
,Adonii22,2013-04-23T20:54Z,@Tsukichan Same With Me It Loads The Prologue Screen Once Its Done It Crashes
,Lmo613,2013-04-23T22:43Z,Win7 64bit Still Crashing even after changing option to single player. I guess I will have to wait for a fix :(
,SMOAK-inc,2013-04-24T02:47Z,As soon as the opening prologue videos are done and it tries to load into actually playing the game it crashes. Win7 x64. Changed the online options and all that stuff. Guess I too will have to wait for an x64 version.
,roninwater,2013-04-24T02:59Z,"Okay, so I was having problems with this install but seems to work for me now & I created an account just so I could comment on how I got it to work (Win 7 pro). 
First, the setup wanted to install the program file under ""C: GamesTomb Raider"" by default, which I thought was odd, so instead I installed it into: C:Program Files (x86)DeepSilver , as that was where the previous Dead Island game was located. Then I disabled my firewall (enabled ""game mode"") as that seemed to prevent the game from loading up. At the menu screen I set it to ""single player only"" as suggested, but I was still getting a message that said ""data could not be saved"". I then just tried to run it with administrator access and the game runs smoothly now. Selected my character, played for a few min to test it out, 0 crashes. "
,roninwater,2013-04-24T03:22Z,"Well, great I was wrong. Game played fine for about 10 minutes, then I quit to log in here to comment & now it crashes. "
,aremic,2013-04-24T03:23Z,"As far as I can tell- the crashing after the opening cutscenes lies with the  ""steam_api.dll""  . Perhaps someone would upload a working crack soon."
,xylo33,2013-04-24T04:39Z,I'm glad I didn't pay for this game !
,momolbfr,2013-04-24T07:44Z,how to change language ?
,lumen42,2013-04-24T22:43Z,"Played all last night without a single crash, but when I started the game up today my savegames are gone!"
,Tsukichan,2013-04-25T03:44Z,"Anyone know how to stop the game from crashing after it loads the prologue? I want to play but it always crashes. Fixes I've tried are

-Running the game as an Administrator
-Switching the Crack and Steam.api files with one my friend sent, of which he is able to play the game fine
-Switching to Single Player Mode
-Reinstalling the game"

you could try this:

adonii22
add -nologos to your target 

right click on your shortcut and to the target ad 
like this 
""C:GamesDead Island Riptidegame.exe"" -nologo
this worked for me ,it gets rid of the first cut seen."
,capricornio,2013-04-26T22:41Z,Here the crash on startup on Windows 7 is fixed by running it in XP compatibility mode.
,Kaizer24,2013-04-29T06:48Z,how the hell can i pick continue??? it doesnt save... any ideas someone? help!
