,generalbeefstix,2013-05-08T23:10Z,"Thanks for the great work and dedication. Your releases are always the best and most straight foward ones (as compared to a .rar file packed full of random shit)

It's been years since I've even logged onto this account but I just wanted to give my thanks since I've been using your releases for years
