'Jack's Luck Runs Out'

Written and Illustrated by Jason Little

Jason Little has created the first full-color book to win a grant from the Xeric Foundation. This brilliant debut details the sordid exploits of Jack, an alcoholic would-be card-counter living in Las Vegas. His life (as well as that of his showgirl girlfriend, Gina) takes an unexpected turn when he crosses paths with the seemingly benevolent club owner, Rex. This gripping pastiche of Jim Thompson and the U.S. Playing Card Company also includes a fascinating demonstration of full-color no-glasses 3-D Comics.
