This torrent is a copy of The.Song.of.Bernadette.1943.720p.BluRay.x264-PSYCHD_[PublicHD] (#8312682), but with an improved subtitle track. That torrent was ripped from the Twilight Time Blu-ray, whose subtitles have several problems: utterances of multiple speakers are run together; the SDH tags are distracting to a hearing person who is watching the movie intently, whether as an act of veneration or for the purpose of language study; and the reading from the Song of Solomon during the climactic scene is transcribed incorrectly. 

This torrent fixes these problems as well as correcting a few minor errors.

If you already have the above torrent and don't need English subtitles, you don't need this torrent. But if you require accurate subtitles and don't need them to be SDH, this torrent is better than anything else available.
