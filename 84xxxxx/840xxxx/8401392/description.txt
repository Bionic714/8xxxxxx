From the cartoonist of Van Helsing's Night Off comes another quirky introspective tale. Lone Racer is the story of a down-and-out racecar driver whose days of success are long gone. After a misguided attempt at a bank robbery - where he is supposed to drive the getaway car - Lone Racer decides that his days of going downhill are over. Will he get back on track? A rare blend of whimsy and sadness, Lone Racer is a story of fast cars, faster women, and one man's ride from first to worst and back again.
