'Spiral-Bound'

Top Shelf Productions, 2005, 184 pages

Written and Illustrated by Aaron Renier

With an ensemble cast straight from a box of Animal Crackers, this delightful tale of ambition, morality, and self-discovery is the first major work by extraordinary newcomer Aaron Renier. Drawn in a decidedly beautiful fashion, reminiscent of Richard Scarry and Lewis Trondheim, Renier has given us a fully-realized and compellingly adventurous narrative, at once both achingly naive and profoundly worldly. This tightly crafted graphic novel is the real deal, and will charm your socks off.

"Spiral-Bound is a lush magical landscape. It rekindles the quintessential childhood experience -- of exploring a mysterious new neighborhood street, or cozying up in a favorite tree-fort or secret hangout -- and revels in the details. It reminds us of the joy of discovery, and of finding oneself." -- Craig Thompson, Creator of Blankets

"Aaron's great drawings and strong story is just what this world needs. Especially now, because I have kids and I'd rather move to an igloo at the North Pole than raise them in a world without good comic books." -- Tony Millionaire, Author of Sock Monkey
