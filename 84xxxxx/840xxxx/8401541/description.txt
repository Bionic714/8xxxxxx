The Murder of King Tut adapts bestselling author James Patterson's New York Times bestselling novel. As we visit the Egyptian landscapes back in the time of the Boy King, we also follow the trials and tribulations of his discoverer, Howard Carter, as he searches tomb after tomb searching for what most other archeologists are certain doesn't exist - the Tomb of Tutankhamen and the clues to his controversial and mysterious death.
