,dahaka47,2013-05-02T06:48Z,"Very bad release. It consumes AT LEAST 1.5 gigabytes of RAM AT ALL TIMES. And yet nothing RAM-consuming shows up in Task Manager. Where does the RAM go? No idea. Something is definitely very, very wrong with this release.

I suggest people stay away from this rather suspicious release."
