why is this one packed and confused?, the previous ones where not"

,Andrique,2013-05-04T22:54Z,"@xtse

Before having found this patcher, I did two attempts to crack Xamarin: 1) by reversing/changing/compiling .NET assemblies, and 2) by making a ""proxy"" program to intercept mandroid.exe's stdin/stdout/stderr. Both times IDE believed I'm using an activated Priority edition. Oops! mandroid.exe was the last barrier I couldn't cross.

I must admit Xamarin developers did good. The compiler (mandroid.exe) really DOES check license when compiling -- and the compiler is unmanaged. It's unfair )))))

You keep saying ""Buy the software if you like it."" I am perfectly OK with the idea, but not with the price. If I needed Xamarin to write programs to sell, to make money -- that'd be fair to charge that much. But right now, I need it to get to know Android, to educate myself, to play with my smartphone and prepare to writing fancy real applications. For this private, non-commercial use, I'm still ready to pay, say, a hundred dollars, just like I did with .NET Reflector for example. BUT NOT THE BLOODY DAMNED TWO GRANDS!!! The INDIE edition is a mockery -- even unable to use Visual Studio !!

So, fuck for a fuck. I'm using the patcher instead of being a legal user. Sad.

However, back to out subject. I am now approaching reversing mandroid.exe, nevertheless it's unmanaged. Well, I'm a 25-years experienced developer, it's a shame to me not to make it done :)) So I got OllyDbg, and preparing myself for a battle. Couple of questions to you XTSE, please...

1) mandroid.exe itself -- is it a packed executable?
2) Why .NET assemblies mandroid.exe extracts -- don't I see them in Process Monitor? Presumably it unzips them to memory and loads assemblies right from byte[]...
3) So if mandroid extracts .NET assemblies - does it do anything else? I mean, is it by chance JUST AN EXTRACTOR -- so .NET assemblies do the rest?

I'm looking forward to talk more to you XTSE. Maybe we talk in private? If that's OK with you, here is my Skype: Andrei-Samoylov, and email: Andrei-Samoylov@mail.ru.

Thanks in any case!"

thanks for patcher!!!

anyone patched xamarin monotouch for mac?

TODAY I MANAGED TO EXTRACT THE FAMOUS MANDROID-WIN.EXE!

,Andrique,2013-05-11T19:06Z,"Hi everyone! Cracking Mono/Android is just cracking mandroid.exe, which, in turn is just a wrapper around a group of assemblies.

It unpacks and runs mandroid-win.exe, which is a .NET console program. This exe, along with all assemblies it needs are here: http://my.filechum.com/Jf0258nnPkhX8EF/mandroid-win.zip.

Note that you can rename mandroid-win.exe to mandroid.exe, and use it normally. As a managed program, mandroid-win.exe can be easily cracked. I did it, so happy cracking :)~"
,Xtse,2013-05-13T10:49Z,"@Andrique, patch the extension libraries as well; or generate a valid license & entitlements file.

@skautroll, I actually didn't notice you needed it patched on the iOS to work with VS on windows. I'll take another look at my Mac VM and get the patch uploaded when I get some time. :)"

,Andrique,2013-05-14T02:37Z,"@Xtse actually, with mandroid-win.exe ay hands, reproducing my work is a job for couple of hours.

2 all: I've written an email to Xamarin, explaining what was done. Offered my service of protecting the s/w. Promised not to publish my results. For that reason, the zip file is deleted from hosting.

Blessed are those who had time to download ;)~"
,Andrique,2013-05-14T02:40Z,@Xtse -- are U interested in a private discussion & comparing our works? We could talk emails or skype or like.
,curiolio,2013-05-14T03:56Z,"@Andrique - from saying that 2K is too much for little old you, to telling Xamarin how to fix things so that people like Xtse will have a harder time seems an about face. Why should he want to discuss things with you?

@Xtse, your work is greatly appreciated. One question though. Xamarin.Components.dll and Xamarin.Components.Ide.dll are installed by both Mono for Android and Xamarin Studio when using separate installers with differing versions - one under VS and one under Xamarin Studio. Should both be patched? Also, it seems that there is a newer version of Mono for Android which my Xamarin Studio updated to."

,Andrique,2013-05-14T11:09Z,"@curiolio did I get it right you mean I'm a bad guy? :)~

Ok, I just want to have a stable possibility to use Xamarin in the first place. Say legal Priority edition for two machines -- that would be the price of my services.

Here is from Xamarin's reply:

«We do know that our protection is fairly easy to circumvent. It hasn't been a priority for us to fix this yet; we just count on the majority of people being very honest. I am grateful that you are honest too :-).»

That means, with or without me, sooner or later they will protect the product from attacks; so that neither mine nor Xtse's shall work anymore.

I mean, and that's true, no .NET s/w can be protected 100% -- however, it can be protected enough up to the state where cracking becomes MORE expensive than the bloody 2K.

Back to my offer to Xtse -- that is to share knowledge, that's it. I can reveal my attcak, he his. Together we can discover more about product's protection than just a sum of mine and hist knowledge. Xtse seems to be good in unmanaged; I'm good in managed.

Also, my fancy work with Xamarin is beneficial for all ;)~ as when I design their protection, I have a key for the backdoor! You didn't consider that, did you?

As for your questions - yes, the DLLs need to be patched both in VS installation and XS's.

Talking DLLs, why don't you try my approach -- that needs no patched DLLs nor license/entitlements files in \ProgramData! Though the link doesn't work anynore, I could provide you with the required files. That would be interesting if somobody (you?) compare our works.

Yesterday I downloaded their last installer and it's still the same as the one with version 4.6.4. However, I don't know if they have a newer version of Monodroid itself alone.

Back to my offer to Xamarin, by discussing protection issues and evaluating how many would pay and how many would take a crack, maybe I can convince them to introduce a kind of non-commercial license. Say, if somebody writes programs for himself, the libs could be restricted to work on his smartphone only. And the price would $100-200, with all features enabled, like in Priority.

So... if you still think I'm bad, I do not agree. I consider myself to be good in all tracks :)~ Wouldn't you?"
,Xtse,2013-05-15T09:53Z,"Try the forums for someone to collaborate with Andrique, I'm fine with the team I have. :)

If you patch only the mandroid-win assembly, an entitlements file will still be generated (by the Xamarin.Components.Ide.dll VS extension). Which is fine, your method is acceptable as the file that is generated will contain ""patched"" information.

The patch in this torrent generates the Entitlements file for shits and giggles, it doesn't rely on it - at all lol."
,Xtse,2013-05-15T10:01Z,"It took a couple of hours to determine and crack Xamarin's protection. It is indeed horrible - I hope they make it more fun in the future - leave us a message in the source code or something lol. ^^;

The software is awesome though. I hope the free advertising they get from piracy increases sales, if anything."
