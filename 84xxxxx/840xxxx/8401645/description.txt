What's cool about it:
This bundle includes the following expansions: Wing Commander: The Secret Missions, Wing Commander: The Secret Missions 2: Crusade, Wing Commander II: Special Operations 1, Wing Commander II: Special Operations 2.
The classic of classics, grandfather for a new genre, and an example that was followed by all future space sims
One of the best dynamic soundtracks ever to appear in a video game
The branching storyline's shape is based on your successes or failures; you will never have to replay a failed mission
Overview:
You may be the hottest pilot in the fleet, but this will cool your jets! In Wing Commander you blast your way through the Vega Campaign. YouΓÇÖd better be as good as your reputation because the stakes are too high to play it safe. Just when you think that the action canΓÇÖt get any more intense, or the opposition any stiffer, youΓÇÖll plunge into Wing Commander II. Disgraced and unjustly court-martialed, you have to prove yourself once again and earn the respect of the Confederation High Command. Of course, there is also the little matter of preventing the destruction of the Terran home-worlds.
