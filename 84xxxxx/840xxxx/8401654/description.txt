What's cool about it:
Extreme historical accuracy and complex, underlying game mechanics
Lots upon lots of equipment types, complete with detailed specifications
An absolute must-have both for die-hard grognards and regular strategy gamers
Overview:
Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord takes you from Normandy 1944 to Germany 1945 on World War Two's Western Front. Play as Allied or Axis, ranging from US Airborne to German Volkssturm. Battle across the bocage, tackle a village or two, drive through the plains, push into the woods, and slog it out in cities. 

Combat Mission: Beyond Overlord provides all this and more with its historical scenarios and campaigns. And if there is a battle that isn't covered, make it up yourself with the easy to use editor.
