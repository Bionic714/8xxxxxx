What's cool about it:
Fantastic, addictive turn-based tactical gameplay with some role-playing elements
Tons of authentic weapons and equipment, complete with descriptions
An additional scenario plus a campaign editor to quell your hunger for more Jagged Alliance
Overview:
The smoke is clearing and the bullets have stopped flying. Arulco is free at last, but your job's not over. An all-powerful corporation is assaulting the tiny country and, once again, you are needed! 

Enter a whole new chapter of the critically acclaimed Jagged Alliance 2 with new weapons (10 new ones including models of sniper and assault rifles), new mercenaries (10 new characters), new terrain (including snow), an Iron Man mode and the fantastic new Mission Builder!

Gear up - you have got some Unfinished Business to take care of!

Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business is a standalone game that can be played without Jagged Alliance 2. You can import your character from Jagged Alliance 2. The game also comes with the campaign editor.
