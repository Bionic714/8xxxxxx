,ianken_ms,2013-05-08T06:42Z,"English VOB subs. Not styled ASS.
29.97 FPS deinterlace job. Not VFR or IVTC.

Good enough.

,TitaniumViper,2013-05-19T04:07Z,"Hey guys just here to ask a quick question, but do any of you know what collection of Evangelion isn't edited like this one? You guys may not notice but there are many little *fixes* throughout the show that have been changed in this version and I would rather not of have them change. Most notable one is probably Unit 01's scream when it charges Sachiel in episode 2 was removed in the English version at 18:52. If you guys know I'll try to buy it and release a version of that one too."
,tins47,2013-05-19T17:07Z,"This release (which I think is the Platinum Perfect Collection and not the Platinum Collection, judging from the presence of the extras) is basically the American counterpart of ReNewal of Evangelion.
RoE might be the one you want. If you want a better answer, try asking around evageeks. The people there are quite helpful and they know their NGE"
,TitaniumViper,2013-05-30T22:50Z,"Just got Perfect Collection but currently trying to figure out if its authentic so would anyone know if the following things would be normal for it:
1) The first disc is different from the other 7 (being that the color on the bottom is darker and it looks authentic but it has a few things that are arranged differently on it).
2) Hardsubs on the intro (also the hardsubs seem to vary from Japanese in English characters to English).
That is what's questionable so far and hope it was just ADV screwing it over and if it is real I'll start encoding."
,tins47,2013-05-31T12:45Z,"try searching for reviews of the perfect collection. they normally include pictures and detailed descriptions of the dvds, packaging, content, etc."
,TitaniumViper,2013-06-04T18:44Z,Sorry guys don't think it is possible for me to get the Perfect Collection release. It seems ADV had butchered the video in the most unorganized ways. 
,tins47,2013-06-04T21:59Z,"it's alright. i think this release is more than sufficient for any evangelion fan. i gotta say though, even after end of evangelion, those last two episodes were pure mindfuck"
,Arhukha,2013-06-07T22:03Z,"A very good collection but I have problems to play the episode #20 in Divx, Any help?"
,TitaniumViper,2013-06-08T16:39Z,@Arhukha    Delete the semicolon and it should play.
