,OhHiDere,2013-04-23T14:52Z,"Holy Balls! The game i've been waiting for a- well, few weeks, BUT STILL!!!!

Starting download now, and if it works, full time seed, which benefits mainly middle eastern people, but whatever!"
,Eth1c,2013-04-23T15:15Z,"I'll be holding off on the rush download until some one confirms if this supports Multiplayer.

If it does, I'll seed it to a good ratio.

Let me know please.

,davester27,2013-04-23T16:24Z,"For those who have Windows x64 and keeping on crashing;

Here the fix;

1) Go to Options > Co-op/Online Tab > Turn off multiplayer and change to Single Player Only.

,xboxgamer999,2013-04-23T17:15Z,"Come on people, SEEEEEEEEEEEED"
,xboxgamer999,2013-04-23T17:17Z,@Eth1c no Pirated game has ever supported multiplayer because its impossible to do that unfortunately. if you want multiplayer then buy it on PC or consoles

,fuhrby,2013-04-24T02:16Z,@scrufffs It's a false positive result don't worry about that ... It happens quite often with a lot of keygens and game cracks. Just disable your antivirus before installing and you should be good
,terrysilver,2013-04-24T03:33Z,hello I am having this problem ... Cannot write to game folder. You don't have write permission. how can I fix this?

,Suzerix,2013-04-24T21:24Z,"The game crashes in attempt to announce the game for coop. To stop the crashes, switch the game type to 'single player' or leave it 'cooperative', but with visibility to 'LAN' (not 'online'). Have a good zombie time!"
,terrysilver,2013-04-24T23:58Z,"ok now I feel embarrassed, I didn't run as administrator till now , I could have played this yesterday "
,Tigolebitties,2013-04-25T01:42Z,"I will seed once it's down downloading; and then switch it to singleplayer in the menu once it's done. And I swear to god if I hear one more person say ""It's got a virus"" I'ma give them a virus. Then they can be a bitch for a reason instead of just a bitch.

Let's clear the air; keygens, cracks; etc are illegal... and therefor are on the banned list of programs PAID to antivirus companies to block.  So if you really are that big of a tool of the game industry (remember to support games you love and buy the actual game!) where you can't recognize this; then you probably shouldn't have a device more sophisticated that they used to get to the moon with.  You should probably have a pacifier or a rattle."
,Tigolebitties,2013-04-25T01:45Z,If you ask me; you should have to take a skill assessment test to purchase computers or parts.  Would sure as hell save the world a shit ton of retardation.
,snowstone,2013-04-25T03:13Z,damn crashed twice while i was watching the intro video hope it dose not crash a 3rd time lol
,f_loia,2013-04-25T04:15Z,"Downloaded, installed, cracked and i got the this...""DeadislandGame_x86_rwdi.exe - Aplication error""...""aplication not initialized correctly (0xc0000142)""....any help please !!!"
,Scalenewolf,2013-04-25T05:35Z,Hey i don't know if this has happened to anyone else but when i start up the game i have no audio at all. Can someone help me?
,VOODOO1000,2013-04-25T07:25Z,Game doesn't save...fucking worthless...piece of shit anyway.
,vegeta91,2013-04-25T14:36Z,"Crash fix!!!

I did the following things and game stopped crashing. some of the steps might not be required but I did them all.
1.Run the game as administrator.
2.In the main menu go to options>online> change game type to single player.
and it stopped crashing for me.I even changed texture settings to medium rest all maxedout. I don't think it mattered but since i did it I mentioned it.

Happy gaming"

,terrysilver,2013-04-26T12:26Z,I do have a question where would the save folder be at in the game folder in programs? I know where it is in the 1st one but not this one
,VOODOO1000,2013-04-26T18:15Z,"Download the 'Blackbox""version...works smooth and saves too...run Steam in offline mode  If there's a crash problem try lowering the graphics level. This version has a hack tool."
,zomb413,2013-04-28T02:37Z,@xboxgamer999   As for the call of duty series not having multiplayer....here is a link for my dlc update with cracked server. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8379671/ Currently with over 150 servers to play on.

,Crowatowan,2013-05-11T18:42Z,"Okay, just so you all know this game works and is fine. I installed it fine on the first try, then changed it to be single player and bam, it worked. I don't know WHAT you guys are doing to screw it up but if you have even the slightest clue how to pirate you should be able to do this just fine. And now that that is out there, anybody know any servers that you can connect to for online play?"
