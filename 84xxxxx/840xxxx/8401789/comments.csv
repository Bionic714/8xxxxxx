,sedkiller,2013-04-26T01:11Z,"oudi1988, no it's not a PKG. It's a complete game."
,jascha37,2013-04-29T10:23Z,how do i play this on my ps3?
,chadlo,2013-05-02T08:14Z,where can i find a patch?
,Akniff,2013-05-02T10:08Z,"HEY BRO there's a little something called ""google"", try it out. and there's really no 'legit"" way to do it, it's illegal and if you do it the FBI will show up at your house and arrest your mom, so you probably shouldn't.  lol. anyways thanks to uploader, do i need a pkg for this? my multiman doesn't recognize it for some reason but I can find/launch it through the file explorer thing."
,Akniff,2013-05-02T10:14Z,"disregard, I'm just a moron, thanks again. "
,stefelz,2013-05-08T03:56Z,"@Akniff did you find a way to play it, cause it wouldnt load for me, just freeze my ps3"
,nightdecoder,2013-05-31T13:36Z,"Works for me, Rogero 4.30 CFW + Multiman 4.x
If you have black screen and return to XMB, try to enable BD Mirror in game setting. Thanks ANTiDOTE !!"
,Ozzen,2013-06-08T18:56Z,Works fine with Rebug 4.30 CFW.
