Please Seed!"
,jkillaz,2013-04-23T12:36Z,"Thank You!
I've been waiting for this!"
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T12:54Z,"what did you use to rip or was it a screen cap?

tube digger 2.21 should do it perfectly I believe
older version since the new one has been crippled on purpose due to legal threats
"
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T13:08Z,"yet most people say greer is a gov misinformant 

and $10 a 3 day access online.. come on.. thats a rip off.. $10 to download and keep with no drm surely.. 

if they want people to believe in this.. it should be free.. and ask people to buy the dvd or t shirts or offer a donation to help pay and fans will"

[V],psspss,2013-04-23T13:23Z,i see if I can grab it and fix the audio
,patapum,2013-04-23T13:41Z,how many fps and what audio settins would you use....? 
,q2323,2013-04-23T13:44Z,finally. thanks.
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T14:04Z,"the best screen capture that does audio too is
ScreenVirtuoso PRO"
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T14:07Z,"25fps should be able to handle it..

however tube digger can rip encrypted streams
the dl mode might not work but rec mode does most of the time.. thats if its not that new encryption being used now.some download but wont play still as got some new drm in it.. but alas screencaps always work.. also I wouldnt say webrip but scrncap as theres a big difference in quality"
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T14:09Z,is the audio randomly drifting in the capture or total drift? avidemux has a time shift can correct total audio drift without reencoding but random is near imposs to fix without cutting it up and rejoining
,unreadable33,2013-04-23T15:16Z,Thanks so much for this. I'm not worried about the audio being out of sync. I can fix that. I've been looking forward to this seen I seen Dr. Greer on the JRE podcast. Thanks again man.
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T15:19Z,"god its a mess wont be easy to fix the audio
cant see to pin the amount.. think is randomly drifting.. seem to fix with _+300ms at beginning but at end seemed to be 700ms or more out


also I cant believe they posted that fake free energt coil you tube video in the docu.. kinda makes me think they didnt do the research

the guy faked it by placing a tesla generator in the room under table or under high power lines in a field.."
,q2323,2013-04-23T15:23Z,audio drifts randomly. + - 2 seconds. you can't fix this. I am going to watch it anyway.
,thoughtform1,2013-04-23T15:38Z,Roughly 1100ns audio delay seemed to fix it for me (if using vlc press the G key 22 times while the video is playing)
,rettepp,2013-04-23T15:42Z,"If you are using VLC you can try to use the K button to delay the audio, it seems to be fairly synced at 5000MS"
,thoughtform1,2013-04-23T15:44Z,Actually sorry it drifts... Damn it. Come on someone rip this properly
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T16:14Z,"i have sort of made it better.. seems to be 500ms out when I converted it to xvid then it drifts 100ms per 10min 

i guess he used a mac soft to rip it,, bad choice so much better software on windows and much of its free.. also you need a i7 to screen cap at fast enough. I suspect its a issue with framerate for video being different for audio"
,akia123,2013-04-23T16:59Z,"Hello i paid for the video and want to rip it. but im having a hard time.  i have an i7 with a ssd hard drive. tried screen virtuso, replay video capture, can anyone help me?  i want to get this up asap. thanks"
,Phase30,2013-04-23T16:59Z,Tks dude...being waiting all night for this!!!
,criticalmass5,2013-04-23T17:03Z,"thanks for uploading this, ive been waiting for this to come out for a long time. im sure withing the next few days a better copy will be released. but to you i say thank you sir!"
,akia123,2013-04-23T17:05Z,tube ripper doesn't work for me neither.  need a good capture for win7 please. i want to help out
,q2323,2013-04-23T18:26Z,go with cracked camtasia recorder
,iggy11,2013-04-23T18:35Z,Thanks man from Croatia !!!!!!
,akia123,2013-04-23T18:49Z,thank i will check it out. i have 45 mins left on this one ripper program then will upload quality look ok.  but will rerip if needed to if this program is better
[V],psspss,2013-04-23T19:03Z,"im still working at fixing this but its 5am prob had enough

if you use screen viritso.. make surde to see audio capture to what is recommends.. else it wont capture it in real time.. and set video to avi or xvid
then it will work just fine.. set frame rate to not less then 24

you then can compress it in a video editor
as the audio will be big.. thats how i do it for screen caps"
,redb0x,2013-04-23T19:09Z,Fixed audio: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8403290/Sirius_Movie-[BEST]-(Freesa)
