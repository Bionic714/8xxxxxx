cme (from Bremen, Germany) were among the most influential Hardcore bands of the 1990ΓÇÖs. Edison released their album ΓÇ£to reduce the choir to one soloistΓÇ¥ in 1996, but the recordings date back to 1993/1994, these nine tracks comprise the entirety of AcmeΓÇÖs recorded career (one 7ΓÇ¥, three compilation tracks, one demo).

Presumably the band take their musical cues from early 90ΓÇÖs Hardcore bands such as Born Against and ΓÇÿProtestantΓÇÖ-era Rorschach, but this is occluded so thoroughly by a dense (funeral) fog of extreme metal, sludge and grind that their original Hardcore influences are difficult to pinpoint.
