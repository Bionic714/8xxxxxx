Bio from All Music:

Along with Minnesota's Trashmen, the Astronauts (from Colorado) were the premier landlocked Midwestern surf group of the '60s. They recorded numerous singles and albums and achieved vast regional popularity, but only scored one modest national hit, "Baja." With little material of their own, they judiciously tapped heavyweights like Lee Hazelwood (who wrote "Baja"), Roger Christian, and Gary Usher, as well as covering tunes by Dick Dale and Henry Mancini. The group shone brightest on their instrumentals, which used mounds of Fender reverb and two rhythm guitars; when they sang, the results were much less successful.

All Music Album Review:

Collectables' Down the Line / Travelin' Men compiles two different latter-day albums from the Astronauts on one disc. The first, Down the Line, is a driving, straight-ahead rock & roll album containing tough versions of rock & roll classics like "Memphis, Tennessee," "The Seventh Son," "Walking the Dog," "Sweet Little Rock and Roller," "Down the Line" and "It Doesn't Matter Anymore." Travelin' Men is quite similar stylistically, except that it concentrates on pop and R&B instead of rock & roll, with songs like "She's Just My Style," "In the Midnight Hour," "The Birds and the Bees," "Laugh, Laugh," "Count Me In," "I Know You Rider," "Travelin' Man" and "Out of Limits." Both are solid, workmanlike rock & roll records that may not be exceptional but are of interest to hardcore surf and garage rock collectors.
