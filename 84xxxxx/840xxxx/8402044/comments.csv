A friend told me I was a weeaboo just because i was going to my first anime convention, and i didnt even cosplay. i found all these cool videos there and at another con which led me to downloading videos and find other things out there, which have now ended up being collected here. so thats the story behind the title and how this came about. i like to make mixtapes so i made this one.
