Hey this is just part one of the first volume of weird cool Japanese video clips and other cool things. Theres a ton of video footage of Japan, vlog postings by Ciaela, random commercials, anime clips, ect.

Video mixtapes are the same as music ones just crazier. haha Anyone who has seen Japanarama should like this.
