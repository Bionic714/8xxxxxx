Bio from All Music:

Along with Minnesota's Trashmen, the Astronauts (from Colorado) were the premier landlocked Midwestern surf group of the '60s. They recorded numerous singles and albums and achieved vast regional popularity, but only scored one modest national hit, "Baja." With little material of their own, they judiciously tapped heavyweights like Lee Hazelwood (who wrote "Baja"), Roger Christian, and Gary Usher, as well as covering tunes by Dick Dale and Henry Mancini. The group shone brightest on their instrumentals, which used mounds of Fender reverb and two rhythm guitars; when they sang, the results were much less successful.

All Music Album Review:

Collectables' Surfin' with the Astronauts / Everything Is A-OK! combines the Astronauts' first two records. The first, Surfin' With, contains the group's only hit, "Baja," plus a selection of surf staples like "Misirlou," "Susie-Q," "Pipeline," "Let's Go Trippin'," "Batman" and "Surfin' USA." In contrast, Everything Is A-OK! is a little schizophrenic, containing rock & roll ("Money," "It's So Easy"), blues ("Stormy Monday," "Big Boss Man"), pop ("Dream Lover"), R&B ("What'd I Say") and collegiate folk-pop ("If I Had a Hammer," "Shortnin' Bread"). Needless to say, it doesn't hold together as well as its predecessor, but there are a number of good moments. Furthermore, these two albums, when combined on one disc, capture much of the Astronauts' best music.
