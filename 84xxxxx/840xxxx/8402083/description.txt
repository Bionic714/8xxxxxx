Another album.

This one starts off a little noisy but it gets better, especially the second side.

Equipment used:

Harksound HS-310 Turntable
Stanton 681 Cartridge
JVC JR-S300 Phono stage
Asus Essence STX for Analogue to Digital conversion
Audacity software for capture, splitting, and tagging.

Ripped to 24-bit/96khz.

Please seed after you download, I have more rips coming and I have to spread my bandwidth between them. Even if it's only 20kB/s, leave it going! Other people want this, too.
