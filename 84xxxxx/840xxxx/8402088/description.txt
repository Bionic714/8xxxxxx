Fifth rip.

Gary Moore - After The War.

Features Ozzy Osbourne on vocals for the track "Led Clones"

Does not contain the instrumentals/bonus tracks found on CD/cassete releases. Sorry about that. If I acquire a CD version, it will be here.

Equipment used:

Harksound HS-310 Turntable
Stanton 681 Cartridge
JVC JR-S300 Phono stage
Asus Essence STX for Analogue to Digital conversion
Audacity software for capture, splitting, encoding, tagging.

Please seed after you download, I have more rips coming and I have to spread my bandwidth between them. Even if it's only 20kB/s, leave it going! Other people want this, too.
