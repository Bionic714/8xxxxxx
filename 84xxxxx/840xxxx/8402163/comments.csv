,TlanImass,2013-04-23T18:26Z,"@rico68 OR maybe you missed episode 4. (That episode was a complete surprise to me.) Since, I originally thought that the show only showed 3 times a week."
,Rossixx,2013-04-24T00:28Z,TY for the UP!
,Rossixx,2013-04-24T00:30Z,If anyone had E07 I would appreciate a link cause I cannot seem to find it
,krush233,2013-04-24T05:12Z,"Currently 10 Episodes of Season 2 have been shown. All 10 Episodes are available on Piratebay.

In order to find all 10 I found I had to use different search phrases.

For Example:

1. ""Voice Australia"" (this will give you the most comprehensive list - basically all episodes except Episode 5)
2. ""Voice AU"" (this will give you Episode 5)
3. ""Voice"""
,rico68,2013-04-26T16:27Z,Im positive that your mistaken...Episode 11 is the first battle round show...investigate your labeling techniques before you apply them...some people are not a diligent as i am and might not fully experience their favorite shows if they believe your labels.
,TlanImass,2013-04-27T00:54Z,"@rico68 dude... follow this wiki link. Are you absolutely positive now? Are you even in Australia?
