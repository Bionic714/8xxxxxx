Book Description

You're not going to try one more fad diet that leaves you feeling hungry and deprived. What's the point? When the beast - hunger - attacks, you grab the nearest Twinkie or double-chocolate brownie. Eventually you give up on your struggle to lose weight and go back to your old, bad eating habits. You may have given up on weight loss, but at least you're not miserable.

It doesn't have to be this way. You can lose the weight, keep it off and beat the beast at the same time. The But I'm Hungry! diet/life plan provides the exact combination of healthy foods and lifestyle changes you need to lose weight, feel great and never be hungry again. No more fad diets, just healthy living.
