That final volume of Batman Adventures is as good as a final season of the show. Awesome stuff."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-23T17:15Z,"oh very nice! thanks MissComicGeek! very much appreciated.  [[clears off hard drive space...]]

@BruceWayneJr they certainly might be! my favorite memory is the mad love special.

but it's also sad to look back at these and realize that the great mike parobeck died at age 30 due to diabetes.  :-/"
,Mothra67,2013-04-23T17:54Z,"Wonderful book, and thank you so  much for sharing,you rock!   

STF I didn't know that about Mike P, that's sad, he was great!"
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-24T01:28Z,"...You know, I never bothered with this batbook when it was in print, but these actually are fun reads. Thanks for the upload, young lady. You earned my gratitude this day for certain!"
,blueharvest,2013-04-24T15:30Z,"Good collection and awesome series! A few things that could be added:
There was a Gotham Girls series that used the animated art style
A Harley and Ivy mini-series with Bruce Timm artwork
Some stories from Adventures in the DC Universe that included Batman characters
Some short stories from the Batman/Superman Magazine which were by Kelley Puckett and Mike Parobeck (RIP - Amazing artist)

cheers

,blueharvest,2013-04-29T06:03Z,"Hmmm... re: the Batman superman magazine stuff, I got them from Demonoid last year. 

I haven't downloaded these to see if they are good or not but maybe you can find the Puckett / Parobeck stories from Superman batman magazine here:

I also looked here to try find the Adventures in the DC Universe series but couldn't find it. I'm sure it must be buried deep in some torrent somewhere.

Oh! One more story that would fit in with the Batman Animated stuff is Bruce Timm's short story from the first Batman Black and White series. I can't remember which issue but you can find it in here:

This story was also reprinted in the book Batman: Animated by Chip Kidd with extra ""greywash"" shading added. I can't find that one here either but if you track it down, it is an awesome companion to the animated series
