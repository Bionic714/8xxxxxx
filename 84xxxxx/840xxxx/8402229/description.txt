In support of Movember this year Inspected have put together a special one-off single, 'Beyond The Shadows'. The track will be available via Bandcamp as a pay-what-you-like download, but all donations are hugely appreciated and will be put forward to the Movember & Sons charity.

'Beyond The Shadows' is a unique collaboration that was produced by Inspected artists KOAN Sound, Gemini, Culprate and Asa during a special studio session in order to raise awareness for this great cause. The resulting track is an emotive and dynamic fusion of the artists' sounds that weaves live and electronic elements into its dense textures.
