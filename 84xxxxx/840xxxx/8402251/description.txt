----------About : -----------------------------------

Online broadcasting is certainly something you can hardly find among your average user's day-to-day activities. A highly specialized labor, it needs suitable tools and it takes the expertise of a professional to wield them the right way.

Those interested in trying this activity first hand may get a change through a user friendly software called SAM Broadcaster. It is a powerful utility that is fully equipped with everything one would need to start an online radio station.

The clear and well organized interface allows you to load tracks, add effects for voice and music, create and manage a playlist, to mention only part of the abilities of SAM Broadcaster. The program comes with really good streaming encoders that work with mp3PRO, OGG, WM9, MP3 or aacPlusv2.

These encoders will make the stream readable by MusicMatch, Live365, Winamp or Windows Media Player, not to mention servers like SHOUTcast, IceCast or StreamCast. A neat feature of SAM Broadcaster is its ability to display in the main window how many listeners are currently connected, as well as the highest number of connected stream viewers.

Insofar as the 'equipments' are concerned, rest assured that you'll get pretty much everything you need. The voice and sound special effects are accompanied by equalizers, faders, track queue and history, not to mention a playlist manager and a track organizer that can help you place tracks in appropriate categories.

The 'FM transmitter' and 'Voice-Tracking' features keep SAM Broadcaster ahead of the game, while some handy event and FTP logs, as well as statistics relay and an event scheduler complete the list of goodies.

All things considered, with SAM Broadcaster you simply can't go wrong. Very easy to use even for less experienced users, and packing a lot of features that may appeal to those with advanced knowledge in this area, the software is definitely one of the top choices in its category.
