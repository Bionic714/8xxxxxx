You could also do Kramer vs Kramer if possible."
,beedog11,2013-04-25T14:14Z,Thank you anoXmous! Please upload 48 Hrs. (1982) and Another 48 Hrs. (1990) in 1080p!
,ectoendomezo,2013-04-27T19:36Z,"Arghhhh! Damn! I have a quick list of superior (imho) UL'ers like AnoXmous..but failed to check them all before DL'ing a BIG gig Marathon Man that just finished after a week and is still a little 'crunchy'...damn! Now I'll take this one because uploads from AnoXmous are at the ""artistry"" level..

So thanks Amigo..truly..

Also..been Trying to convince my 'list' to do another interesting film that also happens to ..in this case star..William Devane (Roy Schieder's Boss in Marathon Man);

'Rolling Thunder'.

A truly strange and horrifying movie that could really only be made in the 1970's when America was ACTUALLY politically savvy as opposed to the current era of Political Hyper-Naievete'

Its available but not at the nice 2.5-3G threshold.

Anyway..thanks for this.."
