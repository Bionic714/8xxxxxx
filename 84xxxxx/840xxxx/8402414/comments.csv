,boxatoys,2013-04-24T01:35Z,"Works fine for me on win 7 64bit.

A lot quicker to dl than the other versions."
,spenny5,2013-04-24T01:47Z,"Works perfectly for me, no issues so far at about 3 hours into the game; I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. 

The quality of some of the cutscenes have been reduced which is the reason why the file size is much smaller but its not noticeable. This torrent is great."
,xylo33,2013-04-24T02:43Z,I cant install it ! someone help please .

add -nologos to your target 

right click on your shortcut and to the target ad 
like this 
""C:GamesDead Island Riptidegame.exe"" -nologo
this worked for me ,it gets rid of the first cut seen"
,LanceLionroar,2013-04-24T22:35Z,"The game works fine at first but once I set the resolution to my native one (1440x900) the game doesn't respond to any fucking key so I'm stuck at ""Press any key to continue"" unless I alt-tab out then back in every damn time or just change the resolution to a shitty one. This probably isn't the torrent's fault it's probably something fucked up with the game itself I was just hoping somebody would have a fix anyway."
,r810628,2013-04-24T23:17Z,"Try this if you have crash problems. It works fine for me.

1. Don't install the game in your steam folder.

2. Turn off multiplayer and change to Single Player Only."
