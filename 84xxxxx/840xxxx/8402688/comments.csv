,studog123,2013-04-26T01:41Z,Any seeders? Been on since torrent appeared and none of it has downloaded yet. Is this a similar problem as the Idle Cure torrent?
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-30T17:56Z,"What a shame it is when I put so much effort into creating a discography, only to have it die off in under 48 hours.  Torrents aren't supposed to work that way.

Although I seeded this well the first time I shared it on April 23rd, I've since had to come back and help it along two more times.  Makes me seriously reconsider sharing discographies again."
