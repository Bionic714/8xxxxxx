When I won the annual Eagle Elite College Scholarship lottery, I was thrilled. After all, my grandma had just died and I wanted to take care of my aging grandpa -- he couldn't be a farmer in Wyoming forever. And graduating from Eagle Elite meant opportunity.
But I wasn't counting on meeting Nixon.

Nor was I counting on the rules of the Elect.

Do not touch The Elect.
Do not look at The Elect.
Do not speak to The Elect.
And worst of all? Don't discover the secret they hide, because in the end, you may just realize... it's about you.

This is a New Adult Book, blood, violence, cursing, sexual references, and drug use. Not recommended for those under 17.
