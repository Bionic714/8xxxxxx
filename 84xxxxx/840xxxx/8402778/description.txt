Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane. The dark secrets of her past werenΓÇÖt something she ever intended to share with anyone. They would never understand. No one would ever get close enough to find out. There was always a chance sheΓÇÖd go crazy sooner than they expectedΓÇª

Woods Kerrington had never been one to be attracted to fragile females. They seemed like too much work. He wasnΓÇÖt in it for the work just the pleasure. A night full of naughty fun had been exactly what was on his mind when heΓÇÖd laid eyes on the hot little number that didnΓÇÖt know how to pump gas and needed some help.

What he didnΓÇÖt know was she was as fragile as they came.
The carefree girl who spoke her mind and didnΓÇÖt care what the world thought of her was more breakable than he could ever imagineΓÇª
 

Seed and Enjoy!
