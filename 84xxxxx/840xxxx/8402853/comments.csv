The 6channel audio is messed up. DD out was not encoded properly and sound disappears and appears every few seconds. Cant hear even a single dialogue properly .
Audio is perfectly fine after switching to PCM and good quality. Only DD failed.

Better then the Superman VS The Elite.

Only problem for me was the last ten minutes were way out of sync. Other than that fine. "
