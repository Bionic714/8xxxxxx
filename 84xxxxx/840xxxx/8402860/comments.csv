,RQ7,2013-05-02T08:40Z,"Ok, the game works fine except one thing, the chat window.. The chat window in the game is not visible... I can just see a little bit but that isnt enough. I've tried to change the resulotion but i didnt help.. Anyone ??"
,felipeb0gaerts,2013-06-03T03:00Z,The chat window is a problem that i couldn't solve. Another problem is that some servers does not work. I have a server that i play a lot: 91.121.97.26:7791. Some others work too but not all of them. Sorry if you didn't like the fact of someone spending its time to help some other people.
