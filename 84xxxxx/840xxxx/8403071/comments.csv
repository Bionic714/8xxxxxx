,Eatshitderek,2013-04-23T20:37Z,How do you make it english? and is this just the DLC?
,UltimateHades,2013-04-23T21:27Z,Please how do I be a VIP here at TPB?
,emp_logtrap_walmart,2013-04-23T22:35Z,does this use reloaded crack?
,ssxcool,2013-04-24T02:33Z,how do i install? i click the setup file and choose the english option then the installer just stuck there
,roninwater,2013-04-24T06:01Z,"The other ""Dead Island Riptide"" torrent by HeroMaster worked for me at first, but then crashed every time after that (Win 7 x64). This one seems stable so far (played a few min, quit, reloaded from save, no crashing). The installer by default is in Russian, but the very first box that came up allowed me to change that to English. Also it is ""pre-cracked"", the full game + DLC. Thx."
,cirios83,2013-04-24T10:04Z,"If the game crashes for you:
Go to game ""Options"" ""Online"" ang change Gametype to Singleplayer and crashes have to stop."

,roninwater,2013-04-26T06:03Z,"@xkaotic
 Do you have steam installed? Uninstall this ""dead Island Riptide"", install steam, then try a reinstall & it should work.  OR try HeroMasters new BlackBox version here:  https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8405498/Dead_Island_Riptide-Black_Box"
