Thanks a lot for upload. I'm struggling to survive paying my studies and working and my credit card has been frozen for 2 years now. So I can't pay for this, many thanks for sharing this!"
,jeffplane,2013-04-24T01:25Z,Video is not perfect as mentioned above but more than enough for a free share!
,miketh25,2013-04-24T01:59Z,Those who donated $10 or more on the Kickstarter got the film for free (but they did pay). Just like most Kickstarters. Thanks for this. Good enough to watch. I'd say it's like watching a 360p Youtube video.
,Freesa,2013-04-24T02:12Z,I'm currently uploading the best quality rip I have.  It's 20gb so I'm compressing it.  Will be up shortly.

,fumertue5,2013-04-24T13:19Z,"Dear Freesa. Thank you so much for uploading.
However, I've noticed that this was a bit poorly encoded. Both frame rate and frame size are off. Not anything you can't watch, but as a video pro, this disturbs me not only visually but in a deeper sense. It's all really just small stuff, but I'd like to ask if you could please revise your rip settings and try again. What program are you using?"
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T16:31Z,"yeh the vertical pixels are out.. so black bars occur

I fixed this in my xvid convert I did (see my torrents for it-under UFO news I also added some interviews and extras).. I zoomed in so its full screen came out at 720x404p doesnt look to bad.. 
the bitrate was a little low and minor pixelling happened in 2 places"
,Freesa,2013-04-25T05:01Z,"I just uploaded a highly compressed version of the movie! Great quality and it's under 200mb!
