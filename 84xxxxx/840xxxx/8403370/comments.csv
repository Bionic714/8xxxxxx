,ScottyD7421,2013-04-30T02:46Z,"Thanks for the upload TeK28, much appreciated.

I'm loving this series although as an Australian was a tad disappointed in our latest offering in the superhero stakes.... first we get the Tasmanian Devil, next we got Captain Boomerang and now we got some poor sufer dude Iron Man wannabe....what's next a giant man-eating Kangaroo? or maybe a rabid Koala? LOL"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T14:58Z,"ScottyD7421, you may have to start your own comic company because you're right, aussie heroes get no respect. (which is even more ironic when one of the 3 most popular superhero movie actors is an aussie.)"
