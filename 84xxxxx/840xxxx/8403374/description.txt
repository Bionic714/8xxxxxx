About the Game:

Dead Island: Riptide is an action role-playing survival horror video game developed by Techland and published by Deep Silver.
Although described as a spin-off, the game's story picks up right after where Dead Island left off, 
as the five survivors arrive on another island in the Banoi archipelago, where it has also been overrun by zombies.
The group has landed on a military ship but instead of being taken to a safe place, they are taken captive. 
Later on, the virus has broken out once again and the ship is compromised. 
They fight off the zombies but then the ship hits into some rocks. 
The survivors are washed onto the island of Palanai and realize that the virus has reached there. 
The island is also somewhat flooded leaving hope drowning in the rising tides.....
