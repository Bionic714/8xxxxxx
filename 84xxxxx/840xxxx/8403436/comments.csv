The resolution is 960x544 which seems to be too high for a 500MB encode. At least when ABR encoding and fast x264 encoder settings are used. The result is a fairly low quality encode. Too many compression artefacts.

I don't know what happened to the audio but it's been clipped to the point where even normal speech is distorted. It's very uncomfortable to listen to.

I'd advise not to download these encodes of season 3. There's a torrent on this site containing all episodes from seasons 1, 2 and 3. It's 720p and the file sizes are larger, but I'll be trying to at least download series 3 from that torrent myself instead."
