The Tudor period usually refers to the period between 1485 and 1603, specifically in relation to the history of England. This coincides with the rule of the Tudor dynasty in England whose first monarch was Henry VII (1457 h 1509). The term can be used more broadly to include Elizabeth I's reign (1558 h 1603), although this is often treated separately as the Elizabethan era. The Tudor rulers disliked the term "Tudor" (because the first Tudor was low-born), and it was not much used before the late 18th century. The term Tudor was hardly used in the 16th century and many phrases of periodization used by modern historians, such as Tudor England and Tudor monarchy which seek to emphasize a distinct period, are misleading compared to what people actually experienced at the time
