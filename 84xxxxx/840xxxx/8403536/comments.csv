,jean_lucpeckinpah,2013-04-24T17:40Z,"@sunfy888 - You're gonna be waiting a long time. Wong said he was misquoted on the supposed four-hour cut (he only said he could make a four-hour cut, not that he did or wants to), and that if he ever does revisit the film it won't be for years to come, as with ""Ashes of Time Redux."""

Thanks aoloffline, a trusted friendly name."
