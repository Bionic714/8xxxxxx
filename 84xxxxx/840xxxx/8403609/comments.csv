[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T00:11Z,"you're welcome. unfortunately hardly anyone was reading it... sales had slipped to between 20 and 25 thousand, and the new 52 did help that. a year later sales were around 30 thousand. now the new 52 ""bump"" seems over. (sadly, march's #18 sold under 25 thousand.)"
