,chromepony,2013-04-25T16:40Z,"TxJag, thanks for all your posts.  Whenever you u/l a bibliography I replace what I have by that author with yours because I know they will be top quality.  Do you happen to have, or could you get anything by Don Pendleton""  I have the first 20 Executioner Series books but can't find anything else by him.  Would appreciate anything you can do.  CP"
