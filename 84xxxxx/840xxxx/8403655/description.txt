Roy Munson was raised to be the best bowler in the world
(trained early on by his father). But a fellow bowler,
Ernie McCracken and a misunderstanding with some rough
punks, leaves poor Roy with the loss of his bowling hand!
Not to let this get him down, he gets a prosthetic hand
and becomes a travelling sales man. But it's really all
down hill for him from that night on until ... One day he
meets Ishmael who is Amish and sneaks away from the farm
to bowl (his fellow Amish would disown him if they knew)!
Roy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer and he'll
make him the best bowler the world has ever seen.
Reluctantly Ishmael agrees to go on the road and shortly
afterwards actually finds that life outside the farm is
quite fun. Soon their paths cross that of Ernie McCracken
who is still a top ranking bowler. While Roy's career and
life have landed in the toilet bowl, Ernie is still drawing
huge crowds and all the babes! They both square off for the
ultimate bowling championship ...
