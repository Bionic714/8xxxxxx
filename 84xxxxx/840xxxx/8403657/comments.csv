,Juular,2013-04-24T20:34Z,For what its worth I'd rather wait for R1 copy with the other storyline with Dennis Quaid.
,vampzcore,2013-04-24T20:37Z,Thanks!!
,libertaswv,2013-04-25T04:33Z,"It's directed by one of the guys from Mr.Show - How bad could it be? Worth a shot

Thx xxxlavalxxx!"
,piratewithalongpenis,2013-04-25T06:12Z,"after reading reviews for this movie and seeing the 4.4 rating in IMDB  

I would have to be a troll to download this torrent
i think i will pass"
,l_smiley_l,2013-04-25T06:30Z,does anyone know which version of the movie this is?
,gozinya,2013-04-25T06:46Z,"This is an awful movie. Not even remotely funny. The stars don't help. Plays like an episode of SNL if all the writers were out sick and they hired a bunch of retarded kids to write it instead.

Torrent quality is fine if you really want to see this crap."
,dauntless10101,2013-04-25T07:35Z,Horrible movie!  I accidentally paid to see this in the theater upon recommendation from a theater employee when my movie was sold out.  Fucking walked out after 20 stupid wasted ass minutes and went into a different movie.  Don't waste your bandwidth.
,genoxy,2013-04-25T09:07Z,"Regardless of the terrible reviews, its free and currently sitting in my download column..."

,thorrus,2013-04-25T12:17Z,"The film is ok, it's not that bad if you're don't mind some toilet humor. Kate Winset was awesome, I was laughing my ass off on the first episode. The episode about home studying kid is pretty good too. So generally I'd say there ARE some laughable spots in here."

Just skip to the Emma Stone skit, watch that and then be done.... 

The Sean Williams Scott and Johnny Knoxville part is decent as well.

Overall though, this movie is complete shit and should be removed from existence. "

Worst movie I've seen in ages; waste of talented actors. 
Rotten Tomatoes rated it just 4%.

Critic Richard Roeper summed it up when he said ""Movie 43"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of awful."
,alttpb,2013-04-27T07:50Z,"There's no main storyline to this movie, trust me. It's just a bunch of different 'scenes' that have short little stories in them that lasts 10-15 minutes, then to the next scene. But there are REASONS or a STORY to why there are different scenes, so watch it if you'd like a movie with no base overall storyline."

Don't listen to all the uptight cunt bags on here, the movie was hysterical! "
,mr2old,2013-04-28T20:38Z,"half the comments made are from complete idiots. While not every ""skit"" in this movie are hilarious, there are a few that still make me laugh after having watched this a few days ago.

You MUST like movies that are ""so stupid they are funny"" however or you will not like this."

Thanks"
,Phatfish,2013-04-29T19:23Z,"A - Good

V - OK

M - Well, the movie is basically a number of several freestanding sketches all written and directed by different people and all with variable duration.

Some of them are extremely bad but some are pretty funny and well made so its hard to rate this movie on a whole.

Though, if I went to the cinema and payed 10 euro to watch this I probably would feel a bit ripped off.

Obviously I didn't so I'll say it's worth the download. "
,cheublawm,2013-04-30T09:15Z,"Hi. I never write comments before but I just watched this movie and it is hilarious. 
Even better if you don't know what it's about before you watch it.

Does anyone know where to get the other version of this movie? The one where ""Plot: A series of interconnected short films follows a washed-up producer as he pitches insane story lines featuring some of the biggest stars in Hollywood."" As this is CLEARLY not that version. Thanks for misleading everyone. "
