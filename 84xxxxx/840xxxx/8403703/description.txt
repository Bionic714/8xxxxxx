Overview:
When we last saw our less-than-dashing hero, Leisure Suit Larry, he was in a rather sticky situation. Not one to be tied down, Larry makes the best of things by going on a cruise to forget the previous escapade. Once he arrives on the deck, he finds out thereΓÇÖs a Mega-Contest for the heart and body of one Captain Thigh, the sexiest sea captain this side of the Atlantic. Our hero must use his wits and wiles...wait, heΓÇÖll just cheat and ΓÇ£winΓÇ¥ his way into the CaptainΓÇÖs bedroom. Set sail for steamy adventure on the high seas!

Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail! drops a world-class lounge lizard onto a cruise ship filled with gorgeous women and side-splitting slapstick.
