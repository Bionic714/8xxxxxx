,fieldof,2013-04-27T08:12Z,"WARNING:  Extremely bad translation on the English.srt.  Obviously who ever did it was not fluent in English.  Most subtitles just very loosely correspond.  Example:  ""Drive safely"" is translated as ""careful driver"".  Why would anyone bother doing subtitles in a language in which they were not fluent??"
,flashh80,2013-05-02T15:58Z,Can you download The Ref?  
,flashh80,2013-05-02T16:07Z,Can you also do The Ref (1994) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110955/
