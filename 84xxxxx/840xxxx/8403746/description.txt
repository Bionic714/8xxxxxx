The map pack will also feature six armor and gun skins allowing for additional customization of your in game character. The new game mode is called Master at Arms. The three new multiplayer maps are set against the backdrop of the Locust invasion of Halvo Bay.

The maps are intended to provide a mix of close quarters and vertical combat. The new maps also bring 10 achievements worth 250 Gamerscore. The three maps include Terminal, Blood Drive, and Boneyard. The new game mode, Master At Arms, is a free-for-all game mode exclusive to Judgment.
