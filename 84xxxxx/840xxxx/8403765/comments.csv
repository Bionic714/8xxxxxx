,Alcoholic_jr,2013-04-26T03:52Z,any1 can respond as to how good this torrent is?
,iPro_Syndicate,2013-04-27T13:47Z,"I downloaded, now seeding, I am unaware of how to burn just the 64bit portion, I only want the 64bit. Is  there a way to select this, or just burn the entire downloaded image?"
,robase,2013-05-07T20:04Z,Installed just fine thank you... Now I just need to find a way to activate it. Anyone know where to find a good activator? I don't want to try the old ones I use to use because they had to fix stuff since this is a current version.
,robase,2013-05-07T20:09Z,"Also iPro_Syndicate just burn the whole thing it asks what version to install when your setting it up. As far as the required specs for install I know I don't have 128mb video ram, also I will be trying to install it on a computer that is x64 with only 1gb ram later (maybe 64mb video max)... Alcoholic_jr - Download and install it's good. I'll post back about the activator later"
,robase,2013-05-07T21:41Z,"*Working* Thanks .SceNe. for the upload, I used the Activator (Windows Loader Folder) in the torrent http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8438536/Windows_7_All_Editions___Activator and it was 3.80MB and unchecked the Windows 7 All Editions as I already downloaded this and it works plus has the latest updates. I then applied it with no settings changed then updated to make sure it works, and it does so I am good thanks again .SceNe. - 5-2013"
