Adguard 5.5 is a new release of the popular ad and popup blocking program. Not only it protects users from unwanted ads, it keeps them away from phishing and dangerous websites too. While working siltently in the background, it automatically removes banners from the web pages you visit, thereby saving your traffic and reducing the page loading time. The program supports both 32x and 64x Windows versions, and it works on all popular browsers. New release fixes most of the known compatibility issues with third-party applications and some minor bugs.
