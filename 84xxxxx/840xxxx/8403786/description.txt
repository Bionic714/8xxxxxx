Hedley is a pop punk band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, formed in 2004. The band originated in Abbotsford, British Columbia. They were named after the town of Hedley, British Columbia, a name chosen after members heard that it was for sale for $346,000. While the idea of buying the town ran its course, the name remained. There are also rumors that the name "Hedley" originated from Hedley Street in Abbotsford, the hometown of Jacob Hoggard.
Hedley is known for its singles "Never Too Late," "Cha-Ching" (performed at the closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), "Invincible," and "Kiss You Inside Out," and for the band members' philanthropic work as ambassadors for the charity Free The Children. [from WikipediA]
