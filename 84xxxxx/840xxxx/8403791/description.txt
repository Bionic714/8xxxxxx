When young couple Malcolm (Wayans) and Kisha (Essence Atkins) move in to their dream place, they soon discover they're not alone. But it's not the home that's possessed, it's Kisha. Now, Malcolm will go to hilarious extremes - including hiring a priest, a psychic and a team of modern-day ghostbusters to get his place and his sex life back to normal.
