there is alot of sites specialized in jailbreaking
you can search downgrade ps3 for example
but you need a hardware for it"

,sextits,2013-05-13T09:57Z,"to jailbreak a ps3, u need a ps3 with ofw 3.55 or less, then u can install cfw onto it and play games from the ps3 hd or external hd. If your ps3 is higher than 3.55 then u need to buy hardware that will enable you to downgrade your ofw to 3.55. Go to psx scene forums or ps3hax.net forums and ask questions there"
,sextits,2013-05-13T09:58Z,"this game black screen and freezes my ps3 when i load it, does it need a fix?"
