,Kamadas,2013-04-24T04:02Z,if its as bad as the new movies...
,Zozur,2013-04-24T04:52Z,"Another great release :D
Team Fairlight! I love you so mush!
You and your seedboxes are awesome! I get top-notch speeds while downloading, even after having several people downloading, as you initial-seed it.

Keep it going, you're the best of releasers, fuckin' epic. Cheers!

,cagunosu,2013-04-24T07:27Z,"Thx up !
System requirements can be found here : http://checkrequirements.com/game/star-trek-pc"
,Somedokin,2013-04-24T08:53Z,"This comes with an installer and an optional custom cracked-intro. The game itself runs fine; no errors after an hour of playing.

The MAJOR downside to this torrent is that you cannot use the Co-Op feature with LAN. Hopefully someone can do a fix/crack that allows for pirates to do Co-Op, but for now this is the best torrent you could get for this game."
,Nounread,2013-04-24T10:34Z,HOw get co op to work/? i dont think co op works with this game crack
,Shoobox,2013-04-24T13:37Z,"ah the young, you can play co -op through tunngle on lan.  Its a pirated game people really should know by know certain pirated games don't work online"
,6patera9,2013-04-24T15:42Z,"Are anyone else having issues getting this to start? I pass the system requirements with no issues. Followed the instructions to the T, yet can't seem to get this to launch. 

I am just curious if I am the only one. I am sure the torrent is completely fine as are all of extremezones torrents. I am just wondering if anyone else is having trouble?

I do have another evolution engine game installed, Warframe and that runs like a dream. If anyone has any idea's or are running into the same issues please give me a shout. Thanks folks and thanks EZ!"
,ye_old_pirate,2013-04-24T17:38Z,"wont start on my win 7 PC I meet all the req.

,supernova2022,2013-04-24T22:31Z,WORKS PERFECT ANYWAY... THANKS EXTREMEZONE.. LOOKS SO FAR LIKE ONLY AN OK GAME ... LUCKY I DID`INT  BUY THIS BUT ILL KEEP SEEDING ANYWAY.. 
,Radeon25,2013-04-24T22:52Z,"Thank you FLT, game is brilliant!!!!"
,Alrik88,2013-04-24T23:14Z,"Torrent works fine, as far as speed goes, I just put it on when I went to sleep and I had it by the time I woke up today. 

Game is a little buggy, and obviously made for consoles but it's been enjoyable so far. The only major issue I've hit is that there seems to be no way to close the upgrades menu once it's been open which forces me to close the game and restart. "
,Alrik88,2013-04-24T23:17Z,"Hm. 

Right after I made that comment I tried the upgrades menu again and now ESC works to close it... it didn't work before, buggy game indeed."
,Schulzforever,2013-04-25T00:32Z,@extremezone can you upload Dyad for PC?  Steam or GOG
,nignug,2013-04-25T02:21Z,co op does work on tunngle. you guys shouldnt expect co op to work with a crack...its still multiplayer
,Datnew,2013-04-25T14:43Z,"Thanks FLT, it looks good!"
,Shoobox,2013-04-25T18:41Z,"Game runs great,

,wrmonahan30,2013-04-26T01:14Z,could anyone tell me what the original name of the .exe is? Mine says game.exe but I need the original name. Anyone help me out please?
,wrmonahan30,2013-04-26T01:17Z,whats the name of the original exe file please?
,WonderPirate24,2013-04-26T10:42Z,"The name of the original .exe is ST.exe.

[T],SCSA420,2013-04-29T23:17Z,"It gives me the error below when trying to install it on 3 different PC's. PC #1 is Core 2 Duo with XP Professional 32 bit OS 3 GB of ram and 512MB Nvidia 8500GT, PC #2 iVista 32 bit OS with Core 2 Quad cpu 4 GB of ram and 1GB Nvidia 8800GT, PC #3 is Core I7 2700k cpu with Windows 7 64 bit OS with 8 GB of ram and 2 GB Nvidia 680GT. I also tried running it in compatability mode and it does NOT work. It still Refuses to install.

The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.

If anyone has any suggestions please comment below me thanks......."
,bungunners,2013-05-01T17:38Z,"@SCSA420...that error comes from the OS trying to run something as an .exe   You are obviously trying to start this in a wrong way.  This is an ISO, in which you need to install Daemon Tools lite, or any other IDE emulators, and mount the ISO to your new virtual disc.  If you have already done all this, then explore the disc and try the different setups from within.  Try the actual ST.exe to start.  If all else fails, you may want to explore the ISO and copy everything to a folder and run from there.  I dunno what else if that doesn't work."

,darklordvyper,2013-05-05T23:20Z,"@KFpcGamer - No one cares what a review says. I haven't played this game, but now I know it's going to be good because Gamespot said it sucked."
,kingofsa,2013-05-06T14:04Z,@darklordvyper Angry joe said it sucks. So Yeah it still sucks...I bet star trek's devs/publishers didn't pay ign like activision does...
,dreamchow,2013-05-07T12:02Z,I'm stuck on the loading screen on game startup. Help?
