I didn't believe that it was a DVDRip either until i downloaded it. I've been waiting for this movie for a while...i figured it would be CAM Audio or an R5 Line or whatever but i assure you, it is definitely not. it looks and sounds amazing and well worth the download.

,pennknig,2013-04-25T03:01Z,"@ horus1sun
MKV is the 1st and only format you get when ripping a BluRay Disk.
The MKV will be approx 10% of the original disk, you can set the ripper differently if you wish.
The MKV, CAN, be converted to AVI-MP4-Etc, and further reduced in size(GB).
REGARDLESS!
VLC does play MKV, if VLC can't play a file, chances are it can't be played.

You are such an asshole, go suck some DONKEY DICK!

Your advise SUCKS DONKEY DICK.
VLC HAS all the codec's needed to play files, no need for others.
If VLC can't play a file, chances are it can't be played, or, the download is broken, reDL.
You are SPAMMING the forum with that link.
That 'FREE' product comes bundled with other adware that has to be installed, or the 'FREE' product won't install.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adware
Adware, or advertising-supported software, is any software package which automatically renders advertisements in order to generate revenue for its author.

VLC DOES NOT COME BUNDLED WITH OTHER ADWARE OR SOFTWARE, ITS FREE AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

Great copy quickly released, thanx. 
As for the movie itself, disappointing. Decent idea, but poorly executed. I wouldn't categorize this as horror, more like awkwardly disturbing. Brings to mind a bad acid trip... If you're into that kinda thing this one's for you."
,dlarrym1111,2013-04-27T01:18Z,"@ouchyfish:
What's wrong with MKV container (it is not a format) but, what is wrong with it. It works great and is much better then AVI, because it isn't interleaved. VLC 2.0.5 plays those files at lightning speed even if they are non compressed HIGH DEF 1080p and 10GB plus in size. I like MKV. Maybe you need an update of your software or your computer. Even my cell phone plays MKV files with FLAWLESS play back and also at 730o HD and higher???? What gives. No warning needed."
,ycory,2013-04-27T04:11Z,i love rob zombie flicks but this sucks fat donkey balls. id say it artistic but its more like autistic.  his wife is the worst fucking actor i have ever seen i cannot stand her good thing she is hot. i fell asleep a half hour in and i tried again made it to an hour and had to turn it off. save your bandwidth people. av= 9-9 thanks anyway juggs

,Pdid,2013-04-28T03:52Z,"AV 10/10 This is Rob Zombie's first movie where he had total creative control. If you like Suspiria or other related occult movies, this is a good flick. If you like retard horror, like the Halloween remakes, then you will dislike this film. It all depends on your intelligence level and your range of horror sub-genre tolerance. I personally enjoyed this movie. It is in mkv but there is a cm8 copy out that is .avi and highly adaptable to many players. Thanks Juggs99! Always on point!"
,bigporch,2013-04-28T11:05Z,"A-10 V-10
What a fuckin movie. Pay no mind to the bad taste at TPB, this is one of the best horror movies to come out in years. Rob Zombie completely knocked it out of the park. It's psychedelic, ballsy, creepy, full of disturbing imagery, gorgeously shot, and perfectly scored. 
This is one of those that will become a cult classic, people will still watch this 20-30 years from now. His best movie, can't wait to see what he comes up with next."
,pennknig,2013-04-28T15:11Z,"@ Pdid
IT WAS FILMED IN 2012
IT IS HIS THE 10TH MOVIE HE WROTE/DIRECTED/PRODUCED

Too many years of drugs and self indulgence has produced this crap.
But maybe,,,,
This was Sheri's idea that she pushed on him?!
If you are expecting something along the line of 'House Of 1000 Corpses' or The Devil's Rejects,,,,don't DL this torrent........."

Worst Rob Zombie movie to date.
Was very dissapointed!
Waited a long time for production to finish so i could see the finished product, and was let down big time.
Sheri moon zombie gets her ass out a few times and thats seriously the best bits of the movie.
Zombie, youve let your guard down...
Oh well"

,Pdid,2013-05-01T00:11Z,Pennknig»Being a director does not guarantee total creative control. Look at Sam Raimi and how much he hated directing that Oz movie. Said Disney fucked him at every creative impasse.

I have enjoyed all of Rob Zombies films thus far. That being said, this was not only a long movie, but a pretty bad one. The acting was pretty good overall minus evil witch cackling scenes, and pretty good production value, but it was a whole lot of nothing really happening. Creepy here and there for an hour and a half and then a very anticlimactic ending. Honestly without giving the movie away I could say everything that happens in the movie in five or six sentences. My advice is to skip this one."
,tiffani7772003,2013-05-04T04:58Z,"been reading some of these comments and if you just did a little research on this movie you would know what its about, all i can say i Zombie has some crazy ass ideas and i enjoy them there different and not basic and fake as hell like some shit that comes out today, hell even his remake was better. but as i said my opinion."
,VegasPlinth,2013-05-04T16:25Z,"Quality is excellent, but movie is less than mildly entertaining. With elements of Eyes Wide Shut, Rosemary's Baby and Insidious, there's nothing really original about this film. House of 1,000 Corpses remains Zombie's best work, but still wouldn't classify this movie as altogether terrible. It just won't be remembered."
