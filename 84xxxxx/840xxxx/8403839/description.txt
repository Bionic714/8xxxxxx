'New Hat Stories: Banks/Eubanks'

Top Shelf Productions, 1999, 160 pages

Written and Illustrated by Tom Hart

The Comics Journal has raved, "There's nobody better at telling a story than Tom Hart", and Banks/Eubanks is an ambitious tale told with simplicity, wit, and the unique combination of wild antics and deep insight that is his signature. Set in summertime Boston (and central Florida during a tropical storm), New Hat Stories: Banks/Eubanks tells of a lazy dreamer's confrontation with a sort of adventure much, much different than the kind he imagines himself worthy of.
