San Diego police officer Larson Jenkins rescues a scared and hurt Calvin Trison, who was attacked by a burglar in his home. In a spur of the moment decision, Larson decides to take the injured man home with him to a secure building where Calvin can recover behind several locked doors, a fat, spoiled cat, and himself. As he finds himself falling in love, Larson knows his greatest fear is all too possible: that Calvin will latch onto him until he feels safe again and then he'll be out the door.
