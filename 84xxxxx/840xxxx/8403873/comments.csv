I forgot what the word ""only"" meant and stupidly tried to install one of these on my 4.3J wii and semi-bricked it (only a black screen would load).  

I've done this before so I wasn't too worried.  Then things went from bad to worse.  Priiloader was still working, but I couldn't load HBC and loading another ""working"" theme through iOS / mymenufy wasn't working either.  

Finally, out of desperation, I just decided to try anything.  A video online said you could just change the system menu in modmanager and everything would be fixed.  Since I had a 4.1 theme on my SD card, I figured why not.  Well, I tried to change my system menu to 4.1J and that was the last I saw of anything.  

Now nothing works, priiloader included.  No NAND backup either.  At this point, my wii is a very stylish paper weight.  

So yeah ... don't do that."
