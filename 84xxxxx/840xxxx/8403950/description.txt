Meet Cathy, Gerty and Sasha, three mature women with one common bond: their absolute obsession with the boy band, 110 Percent ("110 Percent"). Unfortunately, deception is getting the better of them, and throughout the story, relationships will crumble, laws will be broken, and lives will be shattered. Watch as these three friends lie, cheat, and steal to get closer to the band, only to end up further from reality. From the fan-favorite creator of Doublecross, Tony Consiglio now brings us a humorous and scathing commentary on the American obsession with celebrity culture.
