In a quiet, little town, there was once a trio of the most unlikely of friends. For one reason or another, by fate or by chance, they formed the oddest friendship this sleepy little town had ever seen. Despite their differences and through many hardships and troubles, they formed a bond that could not be broken. Through it all, they stuck to each other no matter what; after all, that's what friends are for.
