[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T15:13Z,"Natilie, no i don't. someone else asked about them a few days ago, and IIRC they have been released but apparently haven't been scanned. still keeping an eye out for them.

GP67, you're welcome!"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-04-24T19:17Z,"Thanks man. Love the style used here, how the motion makes things like conversations works. Great addition, looking forward to seeing where this goes.

I keep waiting for your pink skull to change. Should have gotten the VIP by now, all things considered.

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T20:09Z,"BabiesDontNeedSpleens, oh yeah, it's cool.

i don't know if they were the first, but the avengers vs. x-men crossover had a digital chapter (featuring nova) that used this way of presenting a comic. very dynamic! i prefer it.

you could also check out the recent ""guardians of the galaxy infinite"" -- same technique."
