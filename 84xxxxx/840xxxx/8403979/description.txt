Marie's had bad days before - she's slept through her alarm, had her car break down at the most inopportune moment, forgotten about an important assignment until five minutes before it was due. You know, just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Well, that's all going to seem like a walk in the park compared to today. She's about to be chased, shot at, sexually harassed, and guilted into going to her unbearable cousin's birthday party, and she doesn't even know why! Well, maybe she knows why she has to go the birthday party (her mom is an expert guilt-tripper), but that doesn't mean she has to put up with all the other stuff!
