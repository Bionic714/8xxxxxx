Audrey Rose and Darling start out for this round. Cheyenne tags in immediately. Team Dragon's tactic of keeping Cheyenne Jewel out and only using Audrey Rose as relief is taking it's toll. Darling and Syd are bullying Audrey Rose any second she is on the mats with them. Nightmare uses their Tags at the perfect moments so that any glimmer of hope Team Dragon had of score points is ripped from there grasps.
