Issues 1-10 of 'Pickle'

Tragedy Strikes Press/Black Eye Productions, Dec 1992 - Dec 1996

Written and Illustrated by Dylan Horrocks

Ten issues of the comic book Pickle were published between 1993 and 1997 by Black Eye Books.  It included the serialisation of Hicksville and other one-off strips, plus the first 4 chapters of another serial Cafe Underground (as yet unfinished).  There was going to be an issue 11, but this never came out (it appeared instead as the concluding chapter of the Hicksville graphic novel).

Pickle was nominated for two Ignatz Awards in 1997 (best art and best story) and was named number 13 in Chris Staros' list of the top 200 comics of all time (The Staros Report).
