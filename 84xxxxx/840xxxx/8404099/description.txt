Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, April 23 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex continues his break down of the false flag event in Boston as the official narrative dissolves and the establishment scrambles to blame Muslims for the terror attack that killed three people and wounded dozens of others last week. He also runs down the martial law beta test in Watertown and what it portends for America.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
