This is an adaptation of a play and it shows, but is also a great forgotten movie with Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins about the power of State over the individual and crushing ideals. It´s from 1955, when all East European was dominated by Communism, but the subject still is actual. It´s a great companion piece wih the novel Darkness at Noon, from Arthur Koestler (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_at_Noon). 

Peter Glenville would direct a few years later BECKET, with Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole, one of the greatest british movies ever made."

,kinnypa,2013-04-24T23:10Z,"Thanks for the upload, looks like an excellent movie. Just wondering though if you have this set to  initial seeder? I've uploaded 15.5Gb and only downloaded 1.5Gb. I don't mind the wait but my ISP  might be a bit miffed!"
,kinnypa,2013-04-27T03:31Z,Please seed!
,kaminer2,2013-04-29T15:05Z,Hi there. Many thanks for this great movie but... you never finished seeding... I'm almost there and then i'll seed for a week at least but... only if you finish
,kinnypa,2013-04-30T22:55Z,"Kaminer2, I hear ya! I've uploaded 28.2 GB so far and have been stuck at 92% for a week. SteelerJ17 stopped seeding due to too many hit & runners; maybe he'll get back to seeding some of these older torrents when the new ones he's uploading have enough seeders."
