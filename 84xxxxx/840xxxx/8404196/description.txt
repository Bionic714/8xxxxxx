Following World War II, a strong-willed cardinal (Alec Guinness) is arrested as a traitor to the state. His will is strong, but so is that of his inquisitor (Jack Hawkins), a seemingly benevolent man who uses oily charm to lure the cardinal into speaking freely. The interrogator eventually resorts to false evidence, dirty tricks and cruelty. Months pass, and the cardinal's spirit seem impossible to break. As the interviews become increasingly hostile, the captors turn to the last bastion of the immorally powerful: torture. Eventually the cardinal is exploited and destroyed. A tale for all times, all beliefs, and once witnessed, impossible to forget.
