,Cosmic_Rocker,2013-05-03T04:07Z,One question can you run PAL scripts like you can with SAM Broadcaster?  Reason is that I use a pal script to update my Radio stations listing on TuneIn Radio so that when listeners search for artists they will see that maybe my station plays the artists they like.  It really gets your station noticed so its important.

radio42 is very helpful."

My own damn fault for not keeping my mouth shut. Up until now, people were just finding the crack by doing a simple search online. But putting it here is going to give it unwanted attention now. Please don't get me wrong, I'm all for sharing, but this can be a double-edged sword. :("
,Summersky,2013-05-12T04:09Z,Disregard my previous comment. Share. That's what it's all about. Enjoy. This is great automation software and it is continuously updated.

If they are on any other crack site it eventually will be patched to not work in their next version.  Then again it depends on how much they pay the anti piracy company they work with.  Winamp for example has and always will be crackable easily.  However Stereo Tool is not in the USA and programmers outside the USA are far better and will use every extent to stop cracking.  FYI All versions of Stereo Tool down to 4.x can't be cracked.  They all have the message.  However if you drop down to 6.10 you still get the message every 12 hrs, but not the beeping hourly at random.  You don't even need to try and crack it just boot your computer at say 14 minutes after the hour, run sam and then schedule all your ads to play at say 12 minutes after the hour (If you use RadioLoyalty).  This way it will never cut over a song and annoy any listeners.  Sorry not everyone can fork out $100.

As for SAM Broadcaster I'm still waiting for the 2013 crack so that I can try running it on my Windows 8 Laptop I'm getting soon.

Glad to see more sharing here keep up the good work.  This way we all can afford to pay our most important bills Mortgage, Electric, Water, Cell phone, Internet.  Everyone has their hand out."

I really like the potential of this proppfrexx."
