Home, motorcar, servants, the latest fashions: man-about-town Gaston (Louis Jourdan) offers them all to Gigi (Leslie Caron). But she, who's gone from girlish gawkishness to cultured glamour before our eyes, yearns for something money can't buy. Producer Arthur Freed, director Vincente Minnelli and a cast rife with Gallic charm join for this lavish winner of nine Academy Awards including Best Picture. Its Alan Jay Lerner/Frederick Loewe songs sparkle like "The Night They Invented Champagne" or caress with title-tune tenderness. "I Remember It Well", Maurice Chevalier sings to Hermione Gingold.
