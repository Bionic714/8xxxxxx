,Cheops75,2013-04-24T05:04Z,"Yeah for me stuck at 99.8 as well. But the movie is definitely watchable. The subs which I dl is good, just get from here - http://www.nyaa.eu/?page=view&tid=426701"
,xams,2013-04-24T06:57Z,"stuck at 99.8% too, will seed for the next week once completed."
,Mr_.Gone,2013-04-24T07:10Z,"Movie quality is decent. The subs are out of sync in places, and other places they aren't present at all. This is because they're the ass version used for the camrip. Someone please fix. "
,Midnitewolfy,2013-04-24T07:13Z,Its stuck at 99.8% for me too. I believe the subtitles are not properly uploaded because they don't work. I tried the file suggested by Cheops75 but VLC inputs the ordinary text file in a big ugly black box and it sort of interferes with the movie. But its watchable.
,edale,2013-04-24T19:45Z,"When it stops at 99.8% the movie file is 100% complete, it's the subs file that's not downloading.

Also, Midnitewolfy, you need to change the file type of the subs file from *.txt to *.ass. Windows needs to be set to let you see file extensions for you to change them.

To set windows to see file extensions, open ""my computer"" if you have a menu bar on the window (file/edit/view/tools/help/ect.) go to tools; if not (newer Windows OS), tap ""Alt"" and it should show up, then select tools. In the tools menu select ""Folder Options."" In folder options select the ""View"" tab.

Make sure ""Hide extensions for known file types"" in UNchecked, then click ""Apply"" followed by ""OK.""

You should now be able to see all file extensions in windows, which will let you change them. Simply rename the sub file, only changing the "".txt"" to "".ass""."
