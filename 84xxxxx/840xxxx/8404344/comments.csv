,babearoo,2013-04-24T03:47Z,"Yeah real, its my first torrent but I got it on DVD today and know it's not out in the states yet so uploaded it."
,Shocktard,2013-04-24T05:40Z,I call bullshit. Where you at seeders? Whats the verdict??
,666davi,2013-04-24T07:02Z,"This is legit. Had trouble trying to convert the other torrent from mkv, but the begining of this torrent plays even though im not done downloading. It is good quality!"
,666davi,2013-04-24T07:03Z,Also thank you man! Only one other real rip on any sites and MKV sucks balls!

,Fawkes35,2013-04-25T04:00Z,"Thank you babearoo for the upload, the quality was great and I have no complaints. 

The Movie itself though is pretty shitty, but perhaps my expectations were to high from the start. I'm a Rob Zombie fan but this had to be the worst film ever. Extremely slow and overall pointless smh."
,PineappleStarz,2013-04-25T09:36Z,"yeh i agree, movie had no story or point to it
Zombie fans are gonna choke on this one.
not even cinematic enough to make the slow parts effective.
was keen for a decent horror too..."
