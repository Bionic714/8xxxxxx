All the Spider Robinson books I have, including the Callahan series and a number of others. 

I converted some from odd formats, so no guarantees on the quality, although a quick glance at the files, they all looked perfectly readable. And these days, I prefer it to thumbing through my old paperback copies once more!

Just Mobi format here. If you want to convert, I'd suggest Calibre.

Enjoy.
