All the Tim Powers books I've been able to find so far, eight in all.


Dinner at Deviant's Palace
Last Call
On Stranger Tides
The Anubis Gates
The Drawing of the Dark
The Skies Discrowned
The Stress of Her Regard
Three Days to Never


Just Mobi format here. If you want to convert, I'd suggest Calibre.

Enjoy.
