Hello everyone,
I put these two songs out there because these guys have great potential
and their from my home state of Massachusetts (USA).
A very polished and very clean Female Fronted Symphonic-Power Metal Band with excellent
production.
They are unsigned i believe as of yet and only have these two
songs that i got off of youtube and converted to mp3.
Quality is 320kbps.
They will be fundraising throughfor their debut album so go check it out.

After listening to so many bad examples of Female fronted metal
these days I found Anaria refreshing and cool.I also think Mercy Roulette's singing
talent far outways any female vocalists of today.Even more polished than Amy Lee's singing
from Evenescence.
So SEED and enjoy...Thanks!!!
