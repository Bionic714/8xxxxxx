So I hope add ac3 format In the rest of your work"
,Sarom,2013-04-24T06:10Z,"@Iraqe:
Use mkvextractgui (mkvtoolnix), extract the DTS, Use xilisoft video converter and convert the file into ac3, finally mux it with mkvmerge. Ta da! It only takes you a few minutes.

Why DTS? Because has better quality than ac3. Excellent for converting purposes."
,THANGDL,2013-04-24T09:12Z,..waiting for this for along time. Thank so much!!!
,lizardomanson,2013-04-24T13:25Z,"Or use Convertxtodvd, you can find here on torrent. The is easy to convert the mkv to dvd with ac3."
,iraqe,2013-04-24T18:42Z,"Thank you very much for your answer

I already tried the Converter but it does affect the quality of the image and it becomes pointless

I know that dts clearer, I asked the adding ac3 formula to his side

With my sincere thanks and appreciation to you"

,topk,2013-04-25T03:07Z,"Fuck saving on file size, this is 2013 ffs
GIBE BIGGEST SIZE/BEST QUALITY!
Can't wait for 4K ultra hd content!"
,JMit,2013-04-25T05:24Z,"@iraqe & @Sarom:

HdBrStreamExtractor is easier, it converts dts to ac3 right after extracting audio track. Then you just have to mux it back with mkvmerge. I always use it for my lg tv. Just a note: I think you converted the whole mkv, you should convert only the audio track and mux it back so the video track stays untouched."
