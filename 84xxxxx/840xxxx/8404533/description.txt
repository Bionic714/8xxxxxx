Xander Karcek has only wanted two things in his life: Christian Edwards and basketballΓÇöthe man he loves and the game that let him escape a childhood heΓÇÖd rather forget. His two obsessions have served him well. He and Chris beat the odds and stayed together through high school, college, and right on to the NBA.

But life under fameΓÇÖs microscope isnΓÇÖt easy, especially when two men are pretending to be frat-buddies so the world doesnΓÇÖt know theyΓÇÖre the next best thing to married. Their relationship survives the sacrifices they make and the lies they tell to stay together, but when their secret is exposed, the fallout might destroy them when nothing else could.

Chris and basketball are the two things holding Xander together. Now the world is asking Xander to make a choice. Is there an option that includes a future with the man he loves?
