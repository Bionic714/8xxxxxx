This needs Seeders to thrive cuz I can't be the only one!

Thanx!"
,thazsar,2013-04-24T05:22Z,"Thanx, Seeders!  You ROCK!

I wonder if we can make this one of the top Postal Service torrents...they are so freakin AWESOME!"
,thazsar,2013-04-24T16:56Z,"FYI,
#11 Bonus Track 'The Dream of Evan and Chan' is one of the best songs Postal Service has ever made!

Not sure why they didn't include this on the Deluxe Album since it's clearly amazing!!!"
