"If Tomorrow Never Comes"

After Zoe tricks Jonah (guest star Travis Van 
Winkle) into spilling a secret about Brick, 
she unintentionally makes things worse for 
Brick in his love life. Following Brick's 
advice, Zoe decides she must finally express 
her feelings, but timing never seems to be 
her strong suit. Wade and Lemon must learn to 
work together, but things go awry when they 
each try to prove that they know what is best 
for the new Rammer Jammer. Knowing what Wade 
and Lemon are up to, Lavon and AnnaBeth 
(guest star Kaitlyn Black) agree to not get 
involved, but that might be easier said than 
done. Meanwhile, Tansy's (guest star Mircea 
Monroe) brothers surprise her with an 
unexpected visit, leaving George to look 
after them and put up with their wild antics.
