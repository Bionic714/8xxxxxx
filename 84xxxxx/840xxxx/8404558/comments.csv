[V],psspss,2013-04-24T03:26Z,i forgot to add the time duration for sirius but I guess its not needed just handy to know i prob edit mine and add it though
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T03:51Z,"note since its a xvid it wont be as sharp as a mp4
but its been header optimized so should play on smart tvs and older devices

also since it was zoomed to rid black bars some extra pixels can occur

i think its good enough for me.. 
no doubt a dvd rip will appear in days

now Im wondering what the hell happened to the
Romanek Movie.. that been makign it since 2010 and trailer came out mid 2012 and its mid 2013 and I still dont think its been released"
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T04:10Z,"

whats laughable is the premere interview he says it was public funded and now up to you to distribute it not nbc. 

why the hell is it not free download then???? wtf"
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T04:19Z," is it just me.. or is that 3rdphase dude pretending to be other people the voice seems too similar LOL
thats when he shows other clips like a radio chat

but its still some interesting video and some real interviews in it"
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T04:35Z,oh god they even added that proven fake israel ufo over dome footage LOL
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T08:52Z,"theres 2 other movies being made I heard


unbrum ? and Majik

not sure on spelling but if know release dates and more info perhaps post here"
,patapum,2013-04-24T11:11Z,"man, if you want a place to develop new techs you can donate 10$ to greer... thats the purpose of all this"
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T11:20Z,:O
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T11:22Z,nah dont like the guy and didnt think much of the movie either... plus pays if you have a job and heaps of cash to waste but I dont.. 
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T11:24Z,did you watch the docu I upped a few bundles ago.. they certainly tor him apart.. he made silly statements like aliens dont abduction they really all military and all aliens are friendly... geeh no all humans are friendly
[V],psspss,2013-04-24T15:05Z,"theres a few peers and seeders I gather the peers just grabbed the movie not the extra interviews

I will have another ufo bundle in weekend no doubt openmindstv will talk about it.. I see they promoting it and link to the dvd on their website"
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T03:42Z,"
however i do agree if people want the best quality rip they should support them by buying the dvd instead...

frankly i feel they should  of released it freely so more see it and at 360p quality for download means best quality is by bluray etc only

p2p is a good way to get word out"
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T03:53Z," the awake and aware 2013 could be ripped and shared again they charging heaps for all speakers of $35 so I wont be doing it

http://awakeandaware2013.net/pay-per-view"
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T04:37Z,i will add some bits of the conference in the next UFO bundle coming this weekend though.. stay tuned
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T08:08Z,actually I might have to release the ufo bundle tonight sometime as its growing again.. 
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T14:04Z,"now up and includes some more chat with greer

,SerSpec-V,2013-04-27T00:47Z,Thanks I'll check out this Sirius movie.
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T03:07Z,"everyone raving about sirius but if you want to see better stuff on antigravity

then you havent watch my bundle a few weeks ago

[V],psspss,2013-04-27T03:26Z,"

also make sure DOWNLOAD TO ROOT folder or nfts root partition as some people seem to download in a long folder names like c:/my downloads and then find they cant move them or play them.. as p2p soft allows to create longnames and many folders exceeding the windoze explorer .. a typical MS bug thats existed in all windows since longnames were made!
if stuck use my windows longname renamer tool it used MS dos trick to rename longfiles stuck in sub folders"
,SerSpec-V,2013-04-27T04:31Z,The quality of the Sirius movie is OK and is in sync but shudders constantly and isn't smooth. I have tried MediaPlayer and MPC but they are the same. Just letting you know. 
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T05:52Z,"the source ripper used the wrong framerate i think that might of cause some shuddering but my converted i corrected it. I didnt see any issues with it apart from the odd pixels due to the bitrate he used for the mp4.. 

why arent you using the VLC player? 2.06 is very good videolan.org"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T05:59Z,"i just checked it in windows media and MPC and seems ok to me.. is it so bad you cant watch it.. or is it glitching every so often?

do you have win 7? and if so did you install sharks007 codec pack as that solves many problems. all other codec must uninstall first like K-lite

seems theres so issue with codecs on win 7 64but sharks007 has a patch for it as well"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T06:01Z,"again VLC you dont need codecs but it will if doesnt find one internally.. why its so popular is hassle free player..

Also I recommend enabling its video sharpener it REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE to watching any video espc XVIDS"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T06:08Z,I think the shuddering.. in some places like not super smooth panning is that what you mean? is cos the ripper had issues getting a fast enough playback stream as it copied it. why he said frame rate maybe affected. so I think until a dvd rip comes out all other sources will be the same but he did repeat the rips on later days with different sizes sicne his first try so maybe the others are better.. but as I said above I dont care.. if people want the best quality buy it and support them.
,nnic028,2013-04-27T18:09Z,Nice movie
[V],psspss,2013-05-03T05:05Z,"i must see docu is the NEW Roswell in the latest UFO bundle
