Game Description:

Command & Conquer: Red Alert - Retaliation combines the campaigns seen in the Command & Conquer: Red Alert PC add-ons Counterstrike and The Aftermath into one complete game for the PlayStation. It also continues the same storyline seen in the original Red Alert.

New additions include specially produced cutscenes, an improved interface for the control pad users, and a special two player mode, where two PlayStations can be connected using the link cable and two TVs. Inserting one of the disks into one of the consoles results in playing a 2 player version of Red Alert, with 100 different missions to play.
