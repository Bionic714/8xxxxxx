,phase700b,2013-04-25T17:01Z,Thanks HighCode. These look great. I replaced my old 1080 encodes of these and got about 25gb of space back!
[V],HighCode,2013-04-25T18:29Z,"25gb of space back? LOL
I'm not surprised, after lots pf tests/samples I came to the conclusion that encodes @10-12 MBps gain like 1-2% in quality in scenes impossible to notice in motion pictures, unless on zoomed snap shots.
Thx for the the comment ;-)"

[V],HighCode,2013-05-01T13:46Z,"You're welcome joegi50,
sorry but I won't do any tv-series in the future, I finish encoding Game of Thrones S1-S2 2011-2012 BDRip 1080p DTS multisub then that's that."
