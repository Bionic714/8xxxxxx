,zoomflash,2013-04-27T07:52Z,Your torrents are great but could you add the mobi and/or Epub versions as well?  I can't read PDF on my kindle.  Thanks
,Snowboarding4Ever,2013-05-07T04:50Z,"""zoomflash""  Be a nice human being.  Thank MANTESH for the wonderful information he is providing.  Than analyse your current problem and troubleshoot it.  Eventuall youll either download on book telling you how to convert the .PDF file MANTESH provides into the proper format your wanting.  Or if you want to solve your problem quicker, just go to google and type in ""cnet download"".  Then in the search box, type  ""PDF to Epub"". Then find the proper program.   

Problem solved within an hour if your quick. ;) I'll thank Mantesh for you as well:

THANKYOU MANTESH!!!

Thankyou MANTESH."

Calibre also lets you read most ebook formats on a PC. (Again, Calibre is free, do a search)"
