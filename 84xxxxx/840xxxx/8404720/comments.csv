,spankylishus,2013-04-24T04:40Z,is this the best quality one u mentioned in other thread?? thats one i would like to grab and seed :)
,Freesa,2013-04-24T04:42Z,@spankylishus Yes!
,fedevela,2013-04-24T04:46Z,yeah im ditching my flv torrent and will seed this one instead
,fedevela,2013-04-24T04:47Z,Thanks Freesa!!!!! :)
,thalesmaniacs,2013-04-24T05:04Z,"Hey why am I trying to watch this on VLC and video doesnt show, only audio. Why u use this codec? Now what player can I use to play it?"
,criticalmass5,2013-04-24T05:06Z,very nice thank you freesa.
,Freesa,2013-04-24T06:01Z,"Anyone want to comment on the audio and video in comparison to the last upload? I could, but I want to hear someone other than myself voice an opinion."
,spankylishus,2013-04-24T07:07Z,sweet THANX freesa soon as other downloads are done will crank my upload speed  up and let this seed.. i so agree with what u posted!! sadly im starting to think greer is milking his money from the scene way to much.. its like he is holding stuff back just so can slowly drop things and rake in more money.. its like how apple releases products then fixes few small things they should have before release then they drop another version out and rake in more money.. then rinse and repeat anyways CHEERS and THANX for sharing hope everyone seeds this to help out 
,fumertue5,2013-04-24T13:39Z,"Dear Freesa. Thank you so much for uploading.
However, I've noticed that this was a bit poorly encoded. Both frame rate and frame size are off. Not anything you can't watch, but as a video pro, this disturbs me not only visually but in a deeper sense. It's all really just small stuff, but I'd like to ask if you could please revise your rip settings and try again. What program are you using?"
,chook93,2013-04-24T13:44Z,"Thanks Freesa for this. been looking forward to this one. Got it cranking on my seedbox. I hope the movie is worth and meets all the hype and build up, and have some conclusive evidence..."
,fedevela,2013-04-24T16:33Z,Dr. Greer states that he is basically blackmailing the govt to be left alone with this subject matter. I am sure he is to a certain degree a dis-information agent. Nonetheless his data are very important!
,Freesa,2013-04-24T16:47Z,@fumertue5 That's nothing I can fix.  The rip I had done had some frame issues.  The website they allowed you to rent the movie from was being hammered with requests.  I'm sure once someone gets their DVD in the mail a much better copy will be uploaded.
,nacho58,2013-04-24T19:51Z,Anyone know where to find the english subtitles??
,anthonystarks7,2013-04-24T20:18Z,thanks freesa i was hoping somebody would do this.....im giving out free copies of this movie just so you know your helping a good cause
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T03:26Z,"freesa I think your confused about 720p I see you have that as your horizontal settings.. not vertical
thats why the aspect is has blackbars

your video source is actually 720x400p when zoomed I think 

so think you needed to do something like 1280x720 but im not sure what the source using is
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p

maybe that will help"
,Freesa,2013-04-25T04:21Z,"No, I'm not confused about 720p.  I know how everything works.  This is the ratio at which the movie was ripped at.  I kept it the same and didn't tamper with it."
,orwellwaldo,2013-04-25T04:39Z,"Thanks for this. You are awesome my friend, my gf and I have been waiting for this since we heard about it. "
,Freesa,2013-04-25T05:01Z,"I just uploaded a highly compressed version of the movie! Great quality and it's under 200mb!

,Psilocybong,2013-04-25T08:22Z,Thanks for the upload man.
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T08:56Z,i see theres a new source h264 720p true out now but maybe no one will added to tpb :) personally people if want best buy the dvd im happy with high quality not HD quality
,fakiris,2013-04-25T19:39Z,"Thanks Freesa... U rock.
Documentaries like these MUST be free for all."
,smzcb,2013-04-26T01:22Z,Hey! Thanks a lot for sharing this! :D is there any subtitles i can watch it with? the thing is that my english is not so so good to understand it perfectly
,LJE111,2013-04-26T04:17Z,"Thank you Freesa. I thought the same thing. Really, $10 for a 3-day DL?! Even the documentaries that were made out of pocket or with investors usually only charge "
,master96,2013-04-26T23:32Z,Stop complaining about paying $10. The money goes to energy research and without money Steven Greer can't keep running his awesome project. Hes done a lot of good and $10 isn't a hefty amount. If you like the movie I suggest you buy a copy to support the cause!
,flexy321,2013-04-27T04:33Z,"Ah stop supporting that scammer and known hoaxer Greer. I can't seriously believe you think it's ""good"" he charges $10. The only ""good cause"" you think there supposedly is is Steven Greer's wallet. The more people torrent this documentary the better. Of all UFO ""researchers"", Greer is the worst. Go tell me about his ""awesome projects""? You mean like..charging thousands of dollars to people to see an invisible UFO landing and other ""awesome"" projects?"
,SerSpec-V,2013-04-27T05:30Z,"Both frame rate and frame size are off so video is a little jerky. Black bars top & sides. Dimensions are 720x464, 2500 bitrate, Audio 125kbps  2-channel, Writing Application: MP4Creator 1.6.1d"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T13:47Z,"Its actually 720x400 if you rid the bars.. I did this in my xvid convert of it.. although I used the first source.. the framerate is jerky on panning in places but not bad.. did any one try tube digger 2,1 for ripping it,, use rec mode should work if encrypted like most tv stream sites. not sure if this is really a scrn cap?

as for steven greer being a scammer Im not so sure he might been taken in by some people
although some in the past like john e mack said he was a misinformat cos he said the abductions werent aliens but usa military and all aliens are friendly and friendly aliens dont take bodies at night time and wipe their memories LOL

also someone asked him about the coil on the c2cam chat found here
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8409670/UFO_News_26Apr2013_xvid_avi_Awake_and_Aware_Bits_Flatwoods_Monst

he said he didnt know out side his info and know how.. but Im sure he knew it wasnt fre energy but a wireless power trick done by the kid.. which tesla did and was research before the rich people cut of his funds and wrote him out of the history books"

,tractys9,2013-05-11T15:16Z,Hey I too just registered so I could comment.  I just want to say thank you!  I'm not a stingy person I have been out of work for 8 months with a seriously broken leg/face - funds are getting tight... I really appreciate you taking the time 
,nuggz503,2013-05-13T03:55Z,"Thanks man!! how the hell can these idiots preach about a better society and free energy then turn around and charge people to see the movie. Kiss my ass Steven Greer, u shill!

anyways...thanks for the upload, you're beautiful "
,katruje,2013-05-19T07:50Z,"Just a brief reminder not to get too caught up in this film. Most of the serious Ufology community considers Greer ""damaged goods"". The film mixes good ufo footage with known fake footage. It also mixes good free energy research with clearly fake devices. It's all about the cult of Greer.

Show this to your skeptical friends, and they can debunk it in a second. 

Watch it for fun, but understand it does more harm than good to the UFO community."
