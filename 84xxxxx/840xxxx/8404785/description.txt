"Committed"

A schizophrenic teenage girl at a mental
institution is found murdered. When Megan and
Tommy interview a young patient named Darby,
who seems extremely sane and lucid, she tells
them that she saw the killer climb down from
a heating vent in the ceiling, but most
shocking of all -- he meant to kill her, not
the actual victim. Could the killer be Dr.
Malcolm, the ward director, who is
obstructing their investigation.
