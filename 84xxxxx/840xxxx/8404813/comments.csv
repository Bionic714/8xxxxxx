,ChasUGC,2013-05-11T21:18Z,"Thanks my friend, YIFY. You should have donations at your website. You are much better that Net Flicks or Redbox or Blockbuster. Cheers."
,pcbflare,2013-05-12T12:14Z,Why ppl bitch about the ending? I kinda liked it...
,chaletamale,2013-05-13T08:21Z,"the framerate on this file is COMPLETELY FUCKED! it freezes every couple seconds and creates phantom images. completely unwatchable. i dunno if yify rushed this one out without checking the file first or what but ive had this problem with several other of his releases (usually theyre good though).

i suggest reencoding this so it actually plays then reuploading"
,chaletamale,2013-05-13T10:28Z,ok i take back my last comment. the framerate IS fucked but it works fine if you keep it at the default setting the movie is at. its squished but watchable. obviously youll wanna find a better copy though if you dont wanna bother with problems at all
,sfapepper,2013-05-15T12:49Z,"A10/V10
Never had a problem with your ups YIFY, thanks for the small size and good quality. There's a reason this is the first time I've commented on an upload"

,mark_amburgey,2013-06-07T21:59Z,I agree with the comments about appreciating your smaller files and the fact that you take the time and that you share them with us.. and to the ones complaining how about you share as many videos as TIFY and see if you can make them smaller and in better quality... if so I am sure people would thank you and have good things to say .. wait no that is probably wrong I am sure people like you would come along and complain because the files should be smaller and the quality should be better.. I mean come on people YIFY does a great job helps lots of people and all in all does not have to share or spend their time doing so for us.. some of you just need to learn how to download and have all of your files and drivers in order or maybe get a better computer or a good video card.. again thank you TIFY please keep up the good work and some of us really do appreciate your hard work and the time you spend doing this
