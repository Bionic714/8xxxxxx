Welcome to the first upload for (FCUP), the First Comics Upload Project! 

We start with "Whisper", the story of a ninja-esque young lady created by Steven Grant and Rich Larson in 1983. The series started (like Nexus and Badger) with Capital Comics, later moving to First Comics when Capital shut down. This torrent contains all issues from Capital and First, and also includes a one-shot done for Boom! in 2006.

As always, praise to the creative teams and scanners! Get it, seed it.
