,ChingaTuu,2013-04-24T08:59Z,"...You probably meant mescaline :). Either way, excellent seed, sir. Like you, Stan's work is one that  I've enjoyed, but its frequency was too erratic at times to keep myself reminded to read it when it showed up in my pull files. Now I have digital backups of the pamphlet versions. Muchos grass!"
,binderguy1,2013-04-24T09:36Z,Thanks for the ul!  These were hard to find!
,jazzMani,2013-04-24T12:15Z,"thanks Mr. Spock, it was surely a hard to find collection"
,oskar5000,2013-04-24T18:27Z,"Tyvm,  LTS. I've had a collection from on here that I managed to put together but it was far from complete. Yours is much better and much appreciated."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-24T23:06Z,"Thanks and you're welcomes all around! 

Honestly, this one came together pretty easily (a couple weeks, including my formatting). Sometimes it happens that way, and sometimes it takes months to find what I'm looking for. I definitely prefer the former to the latter."
