At one point in my life (many years ago) I read Usagi Yojimbo. Not religiously, but regularly. I've still got a few of the TPB and a couple dozen issues in one of the long boxes. I didn't stop reading it for any reason in particular; I always enjoyed it, thought it had great humor and intelligence, and I liked Sakai's art, too. It just faded from my consciousness, and then all of a sudden (like, a decade later) I was over a hundred issues behind. Well, it recently came to my attention that the series is currently on hiatus while Sakai works on 47 Ronin with Mike Richardson. That being the case, this seemed like the perfect time to gather up all the Usagi I could find and get caught up so I can jump back on board when the series re-starts. As it turns out, I found everything (give or take a loose bit here and there).

Now, to my eyes, most of these books are screaming for a restoration, but I'm going to refrain. One, because it would triple the size of this already large torrent. Two, I would rather spend the time gathering, scanning, downloading, compiling, restoring and uploading other books. If anybody REALLY wants a restored version, just leave the request in the comments and I'll put it on the to do list.

Lastly, this torrent is much larger than anything I've uploaded in the past. The reason for this is that I don't believe these larger torrents stay seeded for as long, or as heavily. So do me a favor and prove me wrong!

Without further annoying preamble from your friendly neighborhood Spock, this torrent contains...
