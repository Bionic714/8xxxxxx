[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-24T08:07Z,Whoops. I meant to take out all the 'this issues' from the blurbs. The one included below is for the first issue.
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-24T08:16Z,Or above. lol I think Usagi Yojimbo might have fried the synapses a bit.

It sure seems like you're making up for the lost time!

Grazie."

Although, truthfully, I probably need all the synapses I have left. 

Honestly, for a few different reasons, I don't feel like I lost any time. 

First, I got to read a TON of books that were piling up both physically and digitally. 

I also spent a great deal of time working on my YouTube channel, listening to music, reading books (novels, without pictures), and just generally NOT being online, which I really needed.

Lastly, I purchased, downloaded, scanned, restored, compiled and made ready a few couple hundred uploads. When I'm done uploading those I think I'll go about the next batch the same way. TPB is still here in my absence, and there is plenty of other comic books to download.

Not that I don't appreciate the small group of people who always grab my books and offer the occasional kind word for my efforts. I do, for sure! But I burned myself out on it last time and I don't want that to happen again.

BTW it is pronounced ""Pair-a-dime"", lest one be mocked unmercifully by kobolds, et al.

Thanks again to LTS who works like a golem to bring us all this good stuff. Huge props!"
