SOURCE : 42 2013 CAM VOB'S UnKnOwN


Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....


First off thanks for sharing the vobs ( unknown ).
Vobs themselfs ....YUK,sucked bigtime for a number of reasons :(
There was alot of cam movement,glares was so bad i needed sunglasses on to encode this.
AR,perspective all shot too pieces,loads of noise,colouring ...i could list more.

Anyway decided i like a challenge and accept it ....so first of was to rotate the video to a more
levelled up angle,then used perspective filter to pull the sides and bottom.
From there i cropped 95% of all chair shots and borders due to camera movement ...however it does mean 
there is more video missing/cropped.But imho ...better than having chair shots every two mins.

Once done it was a case of toning down the glare,changing the contrast and brightness levels before 
tweaking the colouring and the smoothing the video noise out.

Finally resized the video to a better res :)
Will say....yes there is a fair bit of video cropped.....yes there is parts the AR is off ....yes there is 
parts the angle is still off.
Basically the movement was that bad it would take a 1000's cuts and different rotated to fix 100% and source 
just isn't worth that effort.

Audio cleaned up in Adobe and resave and remuxed.
Removed most of the noise and got the EQ balanced alot better ...couldn't remove the tapping/clicking sound thats at
the start,but that goes eventually and is not there throughout the whole film ;-)

EXTRA NOTE :

Screenies below show the work done,but also shows how much needed to be cropped
to hide the camera movement..chairs etc.
Still nothing special and no enocde of this source will be !!!
However to the cam lovers this might be of some use ;-)
