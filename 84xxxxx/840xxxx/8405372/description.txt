Not for the weak of heart, Josh's incredibly drawn comics are a disturbing expos√© on the dark side of the American Dream, pointing out the sometimes ludicrous underbelly of Democracy and Prosperity. His delicious art and unusual concepts are simply mind-boggling. Fans of Ivan Brunetti's SCHIZO, Pete Sickman-Garner's HEY, MISTER and Johnny Ryan's ANGRY YOUTH COMIX will definitely want to "get Happy."
