-----------------
Sydney is a veteran gambler in his sixties who still spends his time at the casinos. When he meets John, a loser with no money at all, he sees him as a son and tries to help him. Taking him under his wing he teaches him all the angles of the casino life. When John meets Clementine, a waitress and occasional hooker, Sydney must decide how far he will go to protect his new friend, and protect the truth. 
 

P.T. Anderson is the greatest director of last 20 years and this film, made before he was even 30, shows only a glimpse into his brilliance and potential. Rough around the edges it is still the work of an auteur, beautifully constructed and executed and featuring an unbelievable cast. This first work of Anderson's continues to be an entertaining view after many viewings and always leave you wondering, 'what is redemption and what is its price?'
