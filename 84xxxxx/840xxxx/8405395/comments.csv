Don'cha just wanna whistle along to Miracles? Tap your toes to Wildside? Dance with your LoVe, to Lover? Twist one, and roll around town with the windows down, to Rollercoasting?

Thank you for this, ya culties; though I won't need any of Hogwarts' witches, nor a Mayan ritual, to be reincarnated, and cross the abyss, passing over the lake of fire with the blink of an eye. God willing, Amin.

I feel like rollin' one, and finding the way of the walk.

Click click click click click click my name, to see what time it is."
