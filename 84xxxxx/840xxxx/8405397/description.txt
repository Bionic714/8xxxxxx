For Vishnu (Prabhudheva), widely regarded as  
India's best dancer, dance is more than a     
passion - it's the reason he lives! So when   
he finds himself thrown out from the swish    
dance academy he himself set up, by his       
manipulative business partner, it feels like  
the oxygen has been sucked out from the air   
he breathes. Heart-broken, Vishnu decides to  
give up dance and leave Mumbai forever. Howeve
the night before his departure he witnesses a 
most amazing sight - a group of dancers       
preparing for the upcoming Ganpati Dance Battl
- an annual festival that pits Mumbai's best  
dance groups against each other. Watching the 
raw talent of these amazing dancers helps
