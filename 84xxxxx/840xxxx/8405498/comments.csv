I'm getting 1.7 Mb/s on the bottom end, 9.7 Mb/s on the top end.
Take a look and see for yourself: http://bayimg.com/dAMmPAAEe

You need a lesson on how to configure a torrent client, go to your clients forum and seek help."
,remotehugger2,2013-04-25T21:09Z,says steam.api.dll is missing - wont run for me ??? any ideas ?
,countryraj,2013-04-25T21:29Z,"@remotehugger2
Google 'steam.api.dll' and download it."
,XxHABlOSxX,2013-04-25T22:32Z,@pennknig  what do you mean. i ran the test in the setup guide. 
,flame2410,2013-04-25T23:38Z,"I think this is only for 64 bit. If someone can get this one running on 32 bit, let me know."
,VOODOO1000,2013-04-26T02:40Z,Anybody get this to work and does the SAVE GAME work for single player?
,Limbless1,2013-04-26T07:49Z,Installs and runs great ...except the saves don't work
,ckraven,2013-04-26T09:50Z,The game crashes during the cutscene where they wake up in the ship and meet the new immune. Any ideas ?
,Dale112,2013-04-26T12:31Z,Hey. Please be gentle. But how do i start this :D lol I know i know i am a wanker!
,blackjackel2,2013-04-26T15:59Z,"@ckraven
I'm getting the same problem, on the cutscene after they are drugged it keeps freezing then crashing."
,VOODOO1000,2013-04-26T18:06Z,"Wow, this version works smooth and saves too.Thanks.. The ""Reloaded"" version worked but didn't save.Besides that the Reloaded version had a hack tool.  Running Win. 7-64 Radeon 5670 graphics. For those with crash problem try lowering the graphics level."
,ckraven,2013-04-26T19:43Z,"@blackjackel2 problem fixed. Go to options and disable multiplayer, switch to single. Game loads and you can play but you may encounter a new problem. An awful bugged noise after the ship escape which keeps up in playable and in cutscene content"
,Kaizer24,2013-04-27T05:42Z,"the application failed to intialize properly(0xc0000142).click on ok to terminate the application.
pleaseee help me how to fix this?? "
,Limbless1,2013-04-27T15:23Z,Uninstalled this today ....run cc cleaner to clean the registry and re-installed and now the saves works ..woohoo :)
,roan2o11,2013-04-27T18:41Z,works fine but after 2 min of gameplay...the game just crashes...anyone knows why?
,0101neo0101,2013-04-27T19:30Z,"3DM crack v1 seems not to save game progress. And 3DM crack (as the Reloaded crack) gives me ""0xc0000142"" launch error.
Windows Xp 32bit sp3 here. Any solution?"
,brownnotesuicide,2013-04-27T20:06Z,"same problem with the crashes, waiting for a better solution other than ""lowering the graphics level"" other than that, saving works and game runs when it wants to."
,fearstorm8394,2013-04-28T00:03Z,does anyone know where the save file is located?
,Limbless1,2013-04-28T01:50Z,"In game , go to ""multiplayer"" and change type to ""single player"" , stops the crashing."
,Kaizer24,2013-04-28T18:56Z,how to fix save game problem??
,0101neo0101,2013-04-29T10:48Z,"""0xc0000142"" error when launching. 
3DM crack v1 launches the game without problems, but there is no save game progress. 3DM crack v2 and Reloaded crack gives me ""0xc0000142"" error when launching. ¿?¿?"
,0101neo0101,2013-04-30T09:10Z,"Save games issue solved with Skidrow crack!!!
You have to restart the game (ship tutorial again) and reach to Chapter 1."
,bbobssmith,2013-04-30T11:46Z,"neo, where did you get the Skidrow crack?"
,Kaizer24,2013-04-30T15:19Z,"its not working too.still give me that ""0xc0000142"" launch error"

,JiggyJinjo,2013-05-05T13:00Z,"Works perfectly, to launch, just run it in admin :) thanks you very much "
,ViolentC,2013-05-07T15:00Z,"Thanks! works 100%. Had to tell my Anti Virus to ignore the False Positive on that steam.dll. Then run it as Admin. Set to single player in game to stop crashes. All simple stuff.
Do all of the above and you got yourself a 100% working pirate dead island riptide. Cheers."
