Klondike Gold Rush
The Klondike Gold Rush was an event of migration by an estimated 100,000 people prospecting to the Klondike region of north-western Canada in the Yukon region between 1896 and 1899. It's also called the Yukon Gold Rush, the Last Great Gold Rush and the Alaska Gold Rush. Of the 30,000 that arrived in the Klondike, only approximately 4,000 actually found gold. Some set up and sold claims rather than digging for gold themselves. Along the Klondike River, boom towns formed that were supported by the miners. Those that found gold spent their time and money in saloons, while those that found nothing continued to labour. In 1899, miners received news that gold had been discovered in Nome and that it was much easier to get, causing the departure of the majority of the miners and the decline of the boom towns.
