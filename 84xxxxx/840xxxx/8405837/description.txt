Veganize Any Recipe with Confidence!

The Complete Guide to Vegan Food Substitutions is your secret weapon to turning any recipe imaginable into a deliciously "veganized" success - no guesswork or hard labor involved. And no more kitchen failures or recipe flops either. Simply look up whatever non-vegan ingredient you want to sub out, and expert author team Celine Steen and Joni Marie Newman will explain exactly what substitution is best to use and how to make it without compromising taste or flavor, so you'll create dishes that are not only better than the "real" thing, but healthier, too.

With more than 200 recipes and substitutions that show the swaps in action, you'll find step-by-step instructions for replacing everything from butter and bacon to gelatin and gouda. You'll also find healthy substitutions for replacing things like gluten, sugar, and fat, so you can fine-tune any recipe to your dietary needs.

Stunning photography and easy-to-follow charts appear in every chapter, making it a cinch to dip in and out whenever you need a quick reference or recipe.

If you've always wanted to turn your aunt's famous mac and cheese into a veganized taste sensation, or your grandma's buttermilk pie into a rousing, "reinvented" success, The Complete Guide to Vegan Food Substitutions is the solution you've been looking for!
