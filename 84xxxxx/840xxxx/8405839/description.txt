Featured vehicles include Kount's Custom's Legend car, which Kevin's 17-year-old racer son Devin races, and which needs repairs; a rare, 1979 Dodge Dreamer van/pickup truck hybrid with its original 440 engine that belonged to the grandfather of a friend of Danny's, who wants it restored, but whose chrome work and paint job presents a budget problem; a first generation Monte Carlo; and the Model T hot rod from "Buggin' Out", which has since been outfitted with four blowers.
