Featured vehicles include a 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle; a 1981 Chevrolet Camaro Z28 that catches Kevin's eye; a 1966 Cadillac Coup de Ville that the staff select to give away in a raffle at the Rockabilly Reunion; and a custom motorcycle for a Jill, a customer whose idea for something "a little more hardcore" includes drag bars, black chrome and the red-and-gold color scheme of a favorite bottle of nail polish.
