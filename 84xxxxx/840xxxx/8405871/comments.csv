,logichall,2013-04-24T22:25Z,There's no reason a movie needs to be 4 gigs. Such a waste. I have downloaded these before and they look no different than some 700 mb files and I have a top of the line tv. WEAK SAUCE

I don't know what ""top of the line"" tv you're watching on, but it can't be any bigger than 32"" with the standard 2 watt stereo speakers. You have to be blind not to see and hear the difference on a 46""  or larger with an a/v receiver and surrounding speakers. Far from ""week sauce"". I've tried the smaller yify torrents. They're great on a computer, but that's it. 

Thank you Bozx for the fantastic quality uploads with great sound. If I dl a movie and it is good, I buy the bluray. The uploads are nearly as good. "

haha....  Average 700mb movies have a audio bit rate of 128 Kbps, only 2 channel stereo.

While these 4.37GB movies have DTS 5.1 surround sound with audio bit rate of 1510 Kbps.

Plus the image quality on fast moving scenes is far more superior then on a crappy 700 MB file.

I think you must be blind and deaf not to see and hear the difference"
