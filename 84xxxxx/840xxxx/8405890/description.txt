"Girl Code," a spin-off of the successful comedic series "MTV2's Guy Code," premieres Tuesday, April 23 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT, following an all-new "Awkward." "Girl Code" is a strong and smart female driven comedy series bringing viewers a new, hilarious how-to manual full of over the top tips to push the envelope and open the dialogue about the wonders and woes of womanhood, covering everything from frenemies, girl fights and cutting bathroom lines to dancing, drinking and dating. In the same style of irreverent commentary that fans have come to love on MTV2's top rated series "Guy Code," the new MTV series calls on female stand-up comics, actresses and musicians - and even a few guys - to weigh in on the sisterhood that all girls share.
