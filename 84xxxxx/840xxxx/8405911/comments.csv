At least use an entire sentence to ask nicely, sheesh, it should be jerkson. Thanks Tyr3ll, awesome torrent, clean and working, perfect."

you are right bro ;)
indeed Jerson forgot to say please anyway.
Btw,we won't up any other version of 1 click 'cause as far as i know this soft is too outdated.
Xilisoft is largely better for as well as many other newer programs...
I'm sorry Jerson,but try to be more modern bro.
Anyway thx to both for your fidelity.
regards"

sorry bro, i was wrong 'cause you said please indeed !
My bad but your ton is perhaps a little bit troubling sometimes....yeah
It doesn't matter anyway, i will survive (lol)
Sorry again, i was on two pages on TPB at the same time for make a feedback , and i have been probably troubled and made a mistake so.
