Also, is it stereo or 5.1, and what bitrate?"
,ArloKills,2013-04-25T05:22Z,hey why didnt you put in the nfo that the subs are hardcoded? it would have been nice to know before i wasted time downloading
,Future_TV,2013-04-26T02:49Z,Hard coded English subs? Really? No heads up? Don't download unless you're deaf.
