Entire run of the 6th doctor portrayed by Colin Baker. The Sixth Doctor's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month "hiatus" between seasons 22 and 23. Prior to its postponement, season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted, these were all dropped with the reconception of the season in mid 1985 in favor of a 14 episode story arc called The Trial of a Time Lord. Series 20 had 40 minute episodes versus the normal 20 that was used for the rest of the classic series.
