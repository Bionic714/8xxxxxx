There is a modern day oil boom hitting the hills of south central Kentucky on Discovery Channel's BACKYARD OIL premiering Tuesday, April 23 at 10 PM ET/PT. In this high stakes comical rollercoaster ride through the world of wildcat oil drilling, the right equipment, the perfect location and a hint of good luck is the key to making millions - if you know where to sink that drill bit. BACKYARD OIL follows the fortunes of the most boot-strappin' oil men in all of Appalachia - mogul Jimmy Reliford and his sidekick Mad Dog; Coomer, who's raking in $300-thousand a month thanks to an oil strike in his own backyard; a bearded hillbilly named Rascal; and the Page Boys, a father-son team who can't help but bicker about everything...except finding that sweet, sweet crude.
