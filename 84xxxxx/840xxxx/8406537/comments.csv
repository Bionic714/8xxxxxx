,Fletchwar,2013-04-26T00:59Z,"Hi, first of all thank you for uploading such a wonderful, yet overpriced game. But I am having some issues.

When I run the .exe file, it opens a black screen for about 10 seconds, then stops responding. I've tried compatability mode, administrator, etc. Nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?"
,Dwarth,2013-04-26T14:24Z,"I have no idea how to solve the issues, I have no problem to play the game

You should try to go on the official forum, there are several threads about technical issues"
,NetHazard,2013-04-30T05:34Z,Thanks for the quick uploads. It is appreciated.
,dm30001,2013-05-01T04:17Z,"thanks, even better if it had a trainer :)"

,kedeva,2013-05-05T02:16Z,"Thanks!, just a quick question how can i make the cctv work? "
,iored94,2013-05-05T23:25Z,"@Javinv You would have to download each one manually.

@kedeva I haven't played since like Alpha 6 but I am pretty sure since you're asking, they don't work yet."
,Javinv,2013-05-08T17:20Z,@iored94 and could I move my saved games from one version to another?
