,Ahlat,2013-04-24T16:21Z,Thank you STFmaryville. Just 4 more issue till the end! DO you know if Morrisson's last issue has extra pages?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T16:39Z,"well Ahlat, only 3. #13 is the finale and according to DC (so far) it's only 32 pages. although there's a variant cover drawn by... grant morrison?

hey where was our source Scanbro yesterday? do you think he got scared by the publicity?"
,annawonder,2013-04-24T17:04Z,"thank you soooooooo much!!!!
I know you'll upload them as soon as they come out and I always come here to find them. Thank you!
( I really can't get them where I live :/ )"
,Ahlat,2013-04-24T17:06Z,"Yeah, he did. He posted syaing he's going to lay low for a while now.
Also I was counting this issue as I hadn't read it yet. But a variant by Grant Morrisson! I've definitely got to get that."
,Ahlat,2013-04-24T17:12Z,"This is what Scanbro said ""I guess I'll go hide in my bunker for awhile until the heat cools down. Thanks for nothing Rich Johnston! """
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T17:37Z,"lol poor guy! (or girl!) i liked one comment i read though, which was something like ""marvel's really going to be pissed when he leaks age of ultron #10 in a few weeks""

ironically, if he had done any/all of it without attaching a ""handle"" (the Scanbro name), other than monitoring 4chan no one would conclusively know it was the same single person. so i sort of feel that Scanbro, by creating an identity, put a target on himself/herself."
,Ahlat,2013-04-24T18:15Z,"Yeah he did. I personally think he should have stayed anonymous, but he said there people pretending to be him that's why he took the moniker."
,Oneiromancer12,2013-04-25T01:29Z,"Thanks, again, Mr. STFmaryville!

Are you uploading the Image stuff that came out this week?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T02:20Z,"you're welcome Oneiromancer12, and yes, sometime between now and friday morning. have only downloaded 1 of them so far..."
