,Pruusis,2013-04-24T17:57Z,how do you change the graphics settings before starting the game?
,steamfoo,2013-05-02T06:47Z,can someone please tell me if this works?
,jop120,2013-05-05T05:03Z,"Same deal as the last ported version, even with graphics setting on the lowest, on a fairly new iMac running ML, too slow to play, about 1 frame p/sec.

Mid 2011 imac 27""
2.7 GHz i5 (quad core)
4 GB memory
AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB
OS X 10.8.2

if anyone ever gets it to work on a similar spec with Mountain Lion, please share.

I can see myself shelling out for a new 27"" display and an xbox before GTA V comes out.

Thanks Apple for continually refusing to make it possible to use this really expensive imac with the beautiful display as an actual display."

I'm on a 21.5 iMac 10.6.8 from about 3.5 years ago and this thing plays wonderfully. It's a little choppy to start with. But give it 3-5 minutes and it plays great. It's like it has to warm up a bit first.

I'm on the 4th Act of the story with most of the side stuff finished and there have been no real issues at all. It's crashed twice (though opened probably 50) but thats it. The only thing it can't do seamlessly is play the TV, but who cares about that :)

,BrBaFr,2013-05-19T01:40Z,"UnRarX will handle it. Select all of the files, and drag them into that program."
