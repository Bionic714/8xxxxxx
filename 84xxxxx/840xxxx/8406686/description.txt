This NBC comedy show from the very early 1950s had Bob Hope hosting
one week and Fred Allen the next.  I don't have any other episodes.

In this one guest Dave Garroway and Fred talk about the start of the TODAY show.
Fred's theme music for the Chesterfield show TV was the same as his 
old radio show (with other sponsors) but that and his monolog are the only simialarities.
