I used 25th.Hour.2002.720p.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-CtrlHD.mkv as the source.  Unfortunately, I was unable to attain a TS for this project.

25th Hour is one of my favorite movies of all time.  To my dismay, it has never seen a bluray release and as of now there are no plans to ever release one.  It is a movie that anyone growing up through the struggles of September 11th can relate to, albeit riddled with controversial hate fueled regret.

So, why shouldn't you just download the file I mentioned above?

Good question.  A number of you were frustrated, as was I, that there was a StarzHD logo in the bottom corner of the movie for 23,116 frames (approximately 16 minutes total).  This distracted viewers during some of the most emotional and crucial scenes in the film.  My main prerogative was to remove this logo to the best of my ability.  Please view the links below to see the results:

It is not perfect, but I feel it is a great improvement to the distracting logo.

I then applied a light layer of MPEG-2 Deblocking to fix the ugly blocky artifacts that were still present from the MPEG-2 source and improved the gradient distribution (though little work was needed due to the gritty, grainy nature of the film).

Finally, I used 3-passes to reduce it to a size that can be played on any Bluray/PS3/Xbox360 device and easily stored on any style of portable media.

I hope that you enjoy this improvement to the original file that CtrlHD uploaded for us.  Thank you to the original uploader.
