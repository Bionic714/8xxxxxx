With the latest version of Windows Server, Microsoft’s Hyper-V virtualization hypervisor is included and tremendously more powerful. Start using Hyper-V for Server 2012 today by learning how to build your own inexpensive Hyper-V 3.0 home lab in a snap. Follow along as virtualization expert David Davis walks you through installing, configuring, and using the most powerful new features such as live storage migration, Replica, and failover clustering. With the release of Server 2012, the time is right to learn Hyper-V!

A word from the instructor, virtualization expert David Davis:

” Calling All Windows Admins!

Windows Server 2012 is here, and I can tell you from my experience that Microsoft has done a great job with this new release. There are so many new features, but the one I’m most excited about (being a virtualization guy) is the latest version of Hyper-V. Microsoft has gotten virtualization right with Hyper-V 3.0.

Perhaps you’ve been waiting to get into virtualization because you heard that previous editions of Hyper-V just weren’t that good. Maybe you considered vSphere, but felt the cost was too high. Or, maybe you just haven’t had the time to learn about virtualization.

Friends, the time is now!

Hyper-V is powerful, feature-rich, easier to use, and 100% included with every copy of Windows Server.

To get started learning the new Hyper-V 3.0 in Windows Server 2012, all you need is my new video training course. I’ve created this course to be ideal for Windows Admins who want to learn how to:

Install Windows 2012 Hyper-V
Manage Hyper-V and create new virtual machines
Create new virtual networks
Use virtual storage, virtual disks, and snapshots
Use Client Hyper-V in Windows 8
Don’t wait any longer to learn Microsoft’s powerful virtualization technology that can make your datacenter more efficient, agile and scalable while making your life as a Windows Admin easier than ever before!
Good Luck! ”
