Steven Spielberg’s Jaws is one of the most successful movies of all time. According to the author of
the novel behind the movie, the story is based on a spate of shark attacks off the cost of New
Jersey in 1916, which left four people dead. The savageness of the attacks dramatically altered the
scientific view of Great Whites. And Jaws cemented their reputation as terrifying man-eaters. More
recently however, new evidence shows that the Great White may have been unfairly blamed for the 1916
attacks. This documentary conducts new scientific tests using handwritten descriptions of the wounds
of the 1916 victims. And, returning to the scenes of the attacks, it explores whether a Great White
could really have come so close to land, finally revealing the identity of the real culprit. "
