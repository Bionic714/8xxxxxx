,nbrazil,2013-04-24T19:25Z,That is what happens when you exist solely to maintain a copyright. Look at what happened a couple years ago. They staged a storyline (Chaos War) with a resurrection subplot because there was an editorial decision that it was easier to have people rise from the dead than create new characters going under the same names.
