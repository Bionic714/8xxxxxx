What's cool about it:
An involving storyline that will keep you occupied and entertained for a long time
Based upon a well-established pen & paper RPG system The Dark Eye
Complex underlying mechanics for the serious role-playing game fan
Overview:
Something sinister is happening in the seaside town of Riva. Brave and honoured warriors refuse to fight the horde of Orcs attacking the city. An evil force preys on their minds and souls. Can your small band of heroes defeat it in time?

The object of the game is to unmask the men behind the scenes, to unriddle secrets and to never fall for the enticements and allures of Evil. Only those who see through truth and lies will survive this adventure.

Full game title: Realms of Arkania III: Shadows over Riva
