This is the 1.01 update provided by GamersGate that removes the copy protection originally intended for the game Alpha Protocol. I've tried and it works as intended, even with skidrows version. It effectively works like a legitimate crack. The MD5 file is for the .exe file in the 7-zip archive, not the archive itself.
