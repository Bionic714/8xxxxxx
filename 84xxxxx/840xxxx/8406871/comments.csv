,super1313,2013-04-25T01:10Z,I did notice that both The Afters and Silverline kept having this voice come up and interupt the songs to tell you about free tuesday something.
,iDivine,2013-04-25T03:55Z,Thank you!!! This is great. God bless!
,GreatGospelMusic,2013-04-29T21:09Z,"Wanted to say thanks for the music...It's really a blessing to me and my family. 

Q: Have you come across the FGBCF Ministry of Worship 'One Sound' album yet or do you know where I could get it?

Again, thank you for this ""Bundle"" ministry of yours. "
,clvnst,2013-04-30T05:38Z,"TT Thanks for all your hard work, I use your torrents to discover new music. I love the wide range of genre you upload. Would love to see some Page CXVI sometime or maybe even a discography. Thanks again, God Bless "
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-30T17:57Z,"GreatGospelMusic, thank you.  But, do tell, what is ""FGBCF Ministry?""  I may have it, but the name doesn't sound familiar."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-04-30T17:57Z,"Clvnst, my friend.  Your Page CXVI discography (11 albums) will be shared within the hour.  God bless!  :)"
,GreatGospelMusic,2013-04-30T19:42Z,"TorrentTracts, sorry about the confusion. They sometimes abbreviate their title. This is what I'm talking about:

Artist: Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship (FGBCF) 
International Ministry of Worship
Album: One Sound
Release Date: April 2013"
,Tiga1234,2013-05-06T00:35Z,"For Bundle 15, I request DJ Cookie's  Third Day-Audio A-TobyMac Remix"
,L1B1z,2013-05-07T23:05Z,"Thank you for all your posts. Awesome work! I wanted to ask for Je'kob's ""Hope - EP"" and Tragic Hero's ""The Resistance"". Please."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-10T16:31Z,"Tiga1234, is that DJ Cookie just a single song you're talking about?"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-10T16:33Z,"GreatGospelMusic, as it turns out, I did have some ""Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship"" in my collection, but not the 2013 ""One Sound"" that you're looking for.  I'll keep a watch out for it, and share it here if/when I find it."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-10T16:35Z,"L1B1z, although I have that ""Hope EP"" from Je'kob, it's a 2012 release.  I'm onto 2013 now, and I've already shared a Je'kob discography.  Unfortunately I didn't have Hope EP at the time of the discography.  As for Tragic Hero's ""The Resistance"", I've yet to find it.  I've been looking for it before you requested it.  So I'll be sure to torrent it if it comes across my desk."
,Tiga1234,2013-05-10T23:03Z,"yes, it's just a single song"
,L1B1z,2013-05-10T23:04Z,"Okay, Thank you so much, once again really been blessed by you. Thank you."
,GreatGospelMusic,2013-05-20T19:30Z,I appreciate the update. I almost thought you forgot about me. I'll keep looking for it. Thanks again for what you do/are doing.
