2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A little house cleaning, if I may.  It was recently noted that my share of Glenn Packiam's "Mystery Of Faith" was suspiciously missing tracks #3 and #5.  The way I understand it is they weren't tracks at all.  They were spoken word.  As a matter of fact, track #3 was called "The Nicene Creed" and can be found on youtube, and track #5 was called "Prayer Of Confession."

It was also noted that The After's "Life Is Beautiful" album I shared in my last 2013 bundle had some encoding/cracking noises.  I have since acquired a fixed copy of that album which I am including in this 14th bundle today, for those interested in replacing their faulty copy.

And, speaking of this 14th bundle, there are some really good ones in here today including Fred Hammond's long awaited "United Tenors", Kurt Carr's two disc "Bless This House" which I have been unsuccessful in finding until just recently, Martin Smith's full length "God's Great Dance Floor - Step 1", and many others.

Our year-to-date total for 2013 up to 398 releases.
