,ViolenceJack,2013-04-25T00:45Z,"Well, i'm going for broke here and request a few more GoG titles (which i was planning to buy in a couple of month). Can you upload any (or all) of the following? (if you have them or access to) (Note: i'm after the GoG DRM free ones not the scene ones): King's Bounty Crossworlds GOTY - Heroes Of Might  Magic V Bundle - Trine - Arcanum - Overlord + Rising Hell - Galactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition. These are the last titles i'm looking from GoG to finish my collection (at least until new titles come out). Thank you."

Thank you in advance, and thanks for uploading all of these fantastic games! :D"
