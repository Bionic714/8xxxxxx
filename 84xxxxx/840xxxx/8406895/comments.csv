[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-24T17:40Z,"i think it's the last one. however, at the announcement stage of the BW project, they said there would be a Special issue at the end, as an Epilogue to all the various titles i suppose. it's the damnedest thing... i assume it was cancelled/scrapped, but i can't find confirmation..."
,memelpx,2013-04-24T22:50Z,Thanks!
,marvelnerd76,2013-04-24T23:05Z,Haven't been reading these. Are they decent reads? 
,binderguy1,2013-04-25T00:11Z,"@ Marvelnerd76:  That depends on whether you're a diehard Alan Moore fan or not.  Most people didn't want this series to happen out of respect to the writer and GN.

As for decent reading, I'd say it's ok, but mostly nothing new that hasn't been touched upon in the graphic novel.  The writers/artists simply expanded on certain events that may have been implied in the GN.

Your best bet is just to try it and see.

@ STFmaryville: I was wondering about that epilogue which is supposed to be a reprint of the Crimson Corsair back-up series in BW."
,marvelnerd76,2013-04-25T01:20Z,Thanks for info binderguy1. Will read with caution. I wish the big companies would give the creators more respect or compensation.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T01:45Z,"i haven't read any of them; i flipped through them each week but just figured i'd wait for the end and read all of it.

one comment i read earlier was about how hard they tried to expand and add some meaningful stories, even when it was ill-advised. ""did i really need to read an entire comic to understand how bad dollar bill's life was before his death? the original made me understand that in 3 panels."" so yeah, lol win or fail? i guess hindsight will tell us if this was worth the trouble.

another wise comment: ""now these artists can do real dc comics again"""
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T04:43Z,"according to bleedingcool, the epilogue is cancelled. not sure why. so yeah, that's it! all over!"
