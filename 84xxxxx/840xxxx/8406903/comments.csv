I made this torrent, as I haven't found a similiar one when looking for it. "
,jingadjanga,2013-04-24T17:48Z,"I know, it's so strange that hardly anyone uploaded this episode.
Anyway I'll seed for a while"
,JayNic,2013-04-25T06:26Z,"Finally, a 720! Thanks dude. I'll seed as long as I can"
,tstpnwn,2013-04-25T20:31Z,"Torrent seems legit, at least those parts I was able to see.

Speaking of which, got stuck @94,3%...
Like 35 other guys I'm connected to...
So where are those 5 seeds from torrent statistics above? Or 34 that are theoretically visible to my client, but to which it cannot connect.

In other words: seed, God damn leachers!"
,JayNic,2013-04-26T06:31Z,Dude... I still haven't gotten it... stuck on 99.9...
,JayNic,2013-04-26T06:38Z,screw it - all the peers are stuck @ 99.8... there's another 720 on now and I'm dling it at 1.3MB/s
,RiverRaidII,2013-04-27T15:44Z,"There was some trouble with the internet connection, which is now resolved.
The torrent is now fully seeded and re-seeded. 100 seeds at the moment,
as utorrent reports."
,RiverRaidII,2013-04-27T16:07Z,The torrent is now properly seeded.
