                             Sin Episodes: Emergence

Built using Valve's Source engine, this follow-up to the SiN series takes on an episodic structure, expanding on the role of Colonel John R. Blade, a battle worn hero in charge of HardCorps. Joining Blade on his mission are JC, a HardCorps hacker with a secret to keep, and Jessica Cannon, a fiery rookie who can find her way into any secure facility.
                                                                                                                   IMPORTANT!!!

This game has one big glitch at the U4 Labs where you meet Radek. After he's finished speaking, nothing happens and you can't go anywhere, you're trapped between a force field and a door. To get out of this, you can use my save files in the: Sin Episodes - Emergence  SE1  SAVE  Glitch Bypass folder, just copy the 2 save files from one of the:

1) Normal
2) Hard
3) Extreme

folders into the SAVE folder; these save files will bypass the glitch and give you 200% life.

All you will miss is watching Radek and his goons leaving the room, you can then continue on; there are no other problems from there on with this version.
