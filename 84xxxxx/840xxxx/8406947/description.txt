On the 23 of June, 2011 a secret five hour meeting took place between
WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, who was under house arrest in rural
UK at the time and Google CEO Eric Schmidt.


Also in attendance was Jared Cohen,
a former Secretary of State advisor to Hillary Clinton, Scott
Malcomson, Director of Speechwriting for Ambassador Susan Rice at the US
State Department and current Communications Director of the
International Crisis Group, and Lisa Shields, Vice President of the
Council on Foreign Relations.


Schmidt and Cohen requested the meeting, they said, to discuss ideas
for "The New Digital World", their forthcoming book to be published on
April 23, 2013.


We provide here a verbatim transcript of the majority of the meeting;
a close reading, particularly of the latter half, is revealing.
