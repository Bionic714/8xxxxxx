   Embedded SoPC design with NIOSII processor and Verilog examples-2010kaiser
   ==========================================================================


Explores the unique hardware programmability of FPGA-based embedded systems, using a learn-by-doing approach to introduce the concepts and techniques for embedded SoPC design with Verilog
An SoPC (system on a programmable chip) integrates a processor, memory modules, I / O peripherals, and custom hardware accelerators into a single FPGA (field-programmable gate array) device.
In addition to the customized software, customized hardware can be developed and incorporated into the embedded system as well-allowing us to configure the soft-core processor, create tailored I / O interfaces, and develop specialized hardware accelerators for computation-intensive tasks.
Utilizing an Altera FPGA prototyping board and its Nios II soft-core processor, Embedded SoPC Design with Nios II Processor and Verilog Examples takes a "learn by doing" approach to illustrate the hardware and software design and development process by including realistic projects that can be implemented and tested on the board.
