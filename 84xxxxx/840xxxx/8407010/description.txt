For Vishnu (Prabhudheva), widely regarded as   
India's best dancer, dance is more than a      
passion - it's the reason he lives! So when    
he finds himself thrown out from the swish     
dance academy he himself set up, by his        
manipulative business partner, it feels like   
the oxygen has been sucked out from the air    
he breathes. Heart-broken, Vishnu decides to   
give up dance and leave Mumbai forever. However
the night before his departure he witnesses a  
most amazing sight - a group of dancers        
preparing for the upcoming Ganpati Dance Battle
- an annual festival that pits Mumbai's best   
dance groups against each other. Watching the  
raw talent of these amazing dancers helps
