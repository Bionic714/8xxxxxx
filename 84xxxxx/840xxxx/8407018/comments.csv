,RandomPersonHere,2013-04-29T03:22Z,THIS IS A SCAM.  It's just a very large password protected file and a text file that gives instructions to go to a URL to fill out surveys so the stockels99 can get some money off of you.

Uploader is an asswipe scammer who uploads a huge passworded file, then tries to force you to go fill out many surveys to make him money, in search of the password, and doesn't give you the password anyway.
