Teen Titans Go! - Season 1 - Episode 1 (WEB-DL - 720p)
------------------------------------------------------

These teen titans are on the go! Right after they make a sandwich. Or play
some video games. Wait, there's laundry to do. ("Not it!") After that, they'll
definitely go fight some crime. Maybe... Inspired by the original hit series
Teen Titans from Warner Bros. Animation, TEEN TITANS GO! features the return of
Robin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg in all-new comedic adventures. These
five super hero teens have more than just super powers - they have super-sized
chores to do and they're super unsupervised! Saving the world might seem like a
pretty big deal, but after fighting evil all day in Jump City, the last thing
these teens want to do is fight over the remote back home at Titans Tower or have
to clean up after a marathon pizza party. So get ready for comedic mayhem punctuated
by pranks as the teens totally annoy each other, with a splash of crime fighting.
Unless there's something good on TV...

Produced by DC Comics, Cartoon Network and Warner Bros. Animation.

Raven - wanting to watch her favorite cartoon in peace - sends the other Titans
on a dangerous mission to get the ingredients for the greatest sandwich ever.
Cyborg's birthday is coming up, so Beast Boy takes a job at their favorite pie
shop so he can afford an expensive gift. But when he has to work during Cyborg's
party, his job threatens to come between the two pie bros.
