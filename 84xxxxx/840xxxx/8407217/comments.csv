,coolmccool24,2013-04-24T20:50Z,"Sigh.... 3000 seeders in just a couple hours? I'm not sure whether I should trust it or just accept that that many people were waiting for it...

Guess I'll go out on a limb, and I'll post a comment later describing quality if its legit."
,LordKalvaire,2013-04-24T21:53Z,"Looks legit, quality is there. But it seems there's only japanese subs included."

black bars on top and bottom encoded into the video, apart from that quality looks fine. as LardKalvaire stated, only jap subs."

,ybriK,2013-04-25T06:23Z,I'm guessing this is a no english subtitle version since it's the BDrip?

https://github.com/eva3/Evangelion--3.0-Translation

You have to delay them by ~608 sec. though, to compensate for the ghibli short in the beginning. Some lines still are untranslated.

Please tell if anyone knows a better source, i'm sure good subs will appear soon..."
,quetz.gehenna,2013-04-25T18:39Z,It's Great! But subs? I don't get to work the above one...
,rafagogo,2013-04-25T22:09Z,"@quetz.gehenna
The subs are only for the anime not the first part (fast fwd a little), there's a live action short movie before it, which don't have subs."
,clonedfetus777,2013-04-28T04:09Z,"first its not in english nor dose it have english subs, brilliant quality though and still really enjoyable, ide recommend it to any fan.. i will be looking for subs later though i couldn't find any in the brief search i did before watching this movie, just wish i could see this at a cinema, the colour!
