,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T19:21Z,"Thanks for this. But I must being doing something wrong. I cannot get the game to update. I've tried the update, and the installer from the parent site and it keeps coming up as version 14.1.4. Only thing I haven't tried is uninstalling the game and then re-installing it."
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T19:47Z,Uninstalling and re-installing doesn't fix it either.
,simunic,2013-04-24T19:56Z,Says it's already patched or doesn't support version of the game.
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T20:31Z,"@simunic Exactly, because it won't fully install the 14.2.9 update. And it keeps the file as 14.1.4, the only thing that can be done is run the patch for 14.1.4 and play that version. I'm sure there is a workaround, but it's above my pay-grade."
,willjinkens,2013-04-24T20:39Z,Patch and full installer links are here: http://www.ootpdevelopments.com/board/ootp-14-general-discussions/231393-ootp-14-update-version-14-2-9-available.html
,willjinkens,2013-04-24T20:40Z,"Let me know if that works for you both, thanks."
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T20:56Z,@willjinkens Those are the ones I used.
,mattosika,2013-04-24T20:58Z,Works perfectly. gracias
,simunic,2013-04-24T20:59Z,"Cheers. Forgot you had to download the updated game exe. Working now.

Thanks, willjinkens."
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T21:10Z,Those are the links I used.
,willjinkens,2013-04-24T21:24Z,"boondocksaint78: So the update for the game isn't installing correctly for you? Or the crack isn't cracking it successfully? If the game update isn't installing correctly then you may want to make sure the exe isn't lingering in memory for some reason. Other than that, I'm not sure why it wouldn't update."
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T21:26Z,"Finally got it to work, only had to download the updater twice. Thanks again!"
,boondocksaint78,2013-04-24T21:27Z,The updater wasn't updating. I guess the one I downloaded the first time from OOTP hadn't been updated yet.
,sparker781,2013-04-26T17:31Z,@willjinkens - thank you so much for the help...games installed and working
