Derrick the Deathfin is the world's premiere underwater papercraft game.

ItΓÇÖs a fast-paced arcade action title set in a unique aquatic world made entirely out of paper & card. In the game Derrick rampages around the globe munching on paper creatures and destroying everything he sees under the guise of avenging the death of his parents.

After his parents are brutally turned into soup Derrick finds himself all alone in the deep blue sea...

Luckily this gives him a flimsy pretext to destroy everything in his path in an orgy of rigid destruction! DerrickΓÇÖs quest takes him all around the globe, through 3 types of level, 4 different continents, 11 vibrant environments and 32 challenging levels. On the way Derrick must race against the clock and his own metabolism, collect diamonds, jump through flaming tyres in the sky, puzzle his way past manmade obstructions and duel to the death with oversized paper baddies.
