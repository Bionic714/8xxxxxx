On the heels of KittyΓÇÖs return from London, a new werewolf shows up in Denver, one who threatens to split the pack by challenging KittyΓÇÖs authority at every turn. The timing could not be worse; Kitty needs all the allies she can muster to go against the ancient vampire, Roman, if sheΓÇÖs to have any hope of defeating his Long Game. But thereΓÇÖs more to this intruder than there seems, and Kitty must uncover the truth, fast. Meanwhile, Cormac pursues an unknown entity wreaking havoc across Denver; and a vampire from the Order of St. Lazaurus tempts Rick with the means to transform his life forever.
