Unless I'm much mistaken, this is nothing more than a re-post of the YIFY release ( http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7054849/The_Shawshank_Redemption_%281994%29_720p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY ), minus the tag and the external subtitles. Tsk."
,lokii_187,2013-05-12T05:32Z,"Ya you are correct, this was my first movie UL to TPB so I figured I would do a test run on an old classic. All of my current and future releases are and will be my own creations though. I debated re-releasing it but wanted to test-run first, ya caught me on it though lol atleast this is my only one :) And they say there is no honour among theives and pirates, thanks for keeping me honest brother"

There is nothing much wrong with re-uploading others' work (complaints about that always strike me as inane, because... well, this IS piracy, after all). Just don't strip off others' tags, and especially don't replace them with other tags. That comes across as dishonest even among pirates, I suppose... :P"
,lokii_187,2013-05-13T01:38Z,"Ya that was my bad, TPB doesn't allow editing after an UL or I would change it. Atleast it is a solid copy though, not like some of the re-ups I have seen on here. Never made any sense why some people revive some of the quality UL'd by some users... If anyone recalls the old Spider-Man 2 debacle you will know what I mean LoL "
