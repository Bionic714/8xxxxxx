,brigzy,2013-04-24T21:10Z,"It says 32-bit when downloading, I take it that means that it's no good for my Win8 64bit? Wish it was... looks real nice."

No, you may not marry me, but I might take you up on a one-night stand...

Anyway, this is the 32-bit version, but it will work just fine in a 64bit computer. I have the 64-bit version prepared, but I'm waiting until this one gets off the ground to upload it."
