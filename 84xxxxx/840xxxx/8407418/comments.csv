,darthcheeto,2013-04-24T22:15Z,Yo man thanx for the upload if possible could you upload it without the japanese subs or with english subs and maybe MKV instead of RMVB
,seecrespo,2013-04-24T23:03Z,is there a english sub .srt somewhere?
,darthcheeto,2013-04-24T23:28Z,seecrespo there are but it would be useless with the hardcoded japanese subs im currently working at removing them i will then add the english subs but i may not be able to since they are hardcoded so you may have to wait a few more days for the japanese audio englsish subs
