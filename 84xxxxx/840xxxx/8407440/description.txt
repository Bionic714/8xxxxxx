The DVD program "Make Her Pursue You" is an Advanced Bad Boy Training Course from Ron Louis and David Copeland of the dating company "How to Succeed with Women".

Ron and David, after 3+ years of "dissecting the bad boy," did a live workshop on what they have learned about how bad boys get women to pursue them. They eventually have decided to put it into a DVD course so that any man could learn about it even if they have not been in the workshop. The program's focus is to reveal the secrets behind the ways and attitude of a bad boy and why it can have the women they desire doing all the work to seduce them, and how you can apply those traits to make the any woman you desire start pursuing you.
