Info:

Monster Hunter G is a Japan-exclusive game for PlayStation 2. It is an expansion to the original Monster Hunter with more quests, weaponry, and different color variations of its existing monsters. Due to the series lack of popularity overseas, this PS2 title never made it outside of Japan.

Monster Hunter G was re-released on the Wii in Japan on Apr 23, 2009 bundled with a Monster Hunter G Classic Controller and a demo of Monster Hunter 3. It is also noted that the charge attack has been added to the Great Sword, something the PS2 version did not have.
