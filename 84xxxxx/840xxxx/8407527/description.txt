Bon Jovi were on the verge of terminally languishing in the almost-great league at the end of the 80's, until this excellent record launched them into the rock-stratosphere.

Softer than heavy metal, harder than most AOR, Bon Jovi turned their large air-punching-rock skills (of "Living On A Prayer", "Bad Medecine" etc etc) to producing an album of powerful, mature and strong songs, from the building, driving opening combo of "I Believe" & "Keep The Faith" to the tender "Bed Of Roses". The mamoth "Dry County" (at ten minutes) is a classic which many thought Bon Jovi just couldn't make. The strength of the singles is enough to commend this album, but the album tracks shine too.

Richie Sambora (responsible for some of the best air-guitar fodder) displays a new depth and soleful-ness to his playing, further evidenced on his solo albums. Tico Torres is more powerful than before, and with production that is a fine line between polish and grit, the sound is convincing.

As an album there are only a couple of tracks that don't measure up and the album lacks the hunger and raw energy of "Slippery When Wet" or (the under-rated) "New Jersey", but it is a more complete album and is better equipped to withstand the test of time than it's predecessors.

This is a journey almost into Aerosmith territory (on a soft day), and Bon Jovi get away with all limbs intact...
