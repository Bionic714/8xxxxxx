,resolehtmai,2013-04-25T07:00Z,"Hi YIFY,
Thanks for all your torrents.
SOME FEEDBACK/DOUBT/COMMENTS though:
1) I watch your movies on LED full HD TV. I have experienced that though the video quality is very good but the sound is too suppressed sometimes. (As in too high when music is playing, but too low when dialogs are being said)
2)Also the two black horizontal bars on top and bottom of the movie, I would love if they are not there, and the movie is stretched to cover the complete TV screen. (I cannot adjust the screen size of the TV coz that feature is disabled when I watch movies via USB)."
,alveolate,2013-04-25T11:17Z,"also, nobody gives a fkin crap about horizontal bars on your tv. why don't you get a chainsaw and hack em off? jesus christ."
,DubSesh,2013-04-26T08:01Z,"He makes a valid point about the audio, it has much to be improved, but not going to complain, great movies, great size, great quality. If you want it perfect, go out and buy it."
,Rolex1005,2013-04-26T08:16Z,Movie 43 please 1080p ??

Get a grip please. The black bars on the should not be there, they have no purpose. They can prove to be a problem, as in resolehtmai's case. It is basic ripping 101 that you remove them.

Think before ranting at people who give valid feedback."

,subwoofs,2013-05-17T01:50Z,it actually depends on what kinda stereo you have. i have an old sony receiver with about 8 speakers hooked up to it & mine sounds fine. & if you wanna change the screen settings then purchase a bluray player with a usb input and just use that instead & then you will or should be able to change the settings on your tv. that's what i do & mine works like a fucking dream
