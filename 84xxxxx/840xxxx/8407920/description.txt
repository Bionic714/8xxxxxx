High Quality TIFF images of all US Stamp types 1847 to 1939.   
The torrent includes:
-Over 380 images of individual stamps. I did not include minor changes in color or paper or changes in perforations (this is why I say types).
-Scott Album sections covering US stamps of this period.
-Excel spreadsheet I used to track variations
-ePub, Mobi, and Word files as a companion to the collection with information about the history of the production of the stamps.
