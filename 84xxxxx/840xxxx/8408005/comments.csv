This is how it worked for me:

Right click the first file (001 file) and go open with, find winrar and open it with it. You'll have 2 files inside, extract both anywhere you want. After that mount what you've extracted with DAEMON tools, or some other mounting software, and install. No cracking needed."
,XxCmonxX,2013-04-25T06:48Z,thank you stiffy and please stay tuned for any updates come out for this game i rly lovvve it thanks for fairlight as well
,XxCmonxX,2013-04-25T06:48Z,//show comment//
,coowkeee,2013-04-25T07:28Z,mounted it but i don't see any exe files. how to install it after mounting it? thanks.
,coowkeee,2013-04-25T07:35Z,"lol. Installed it.
This is how you do.
Double click flt-dont.001 and open it with winrar. After that, open mounting software(i used magicIso), then convert flt-dont.bin to flt-dont.iso and mount it then install. :D"
,tofumunch,2013-04-25T12:46Z,"ah heard so much about this game, thx a lot!"
,tofumunch,2013-04-25T13:21Z,"seems corrupted, am i the only one?"
,xGAHx,2013-04-25T15:25Z,"Hey, I'm not new to this at all and i never have problems installing games but what is the importance of blocking a games exe in your firewall because I never have. Ever"
,Dr.Hex,2013-04-25T18:32Z,where can i find the save files ?
,brandobrawl,2013-04-26T18:54Z,Anyone else getting that it cannot run the game because steam_api.dll is missing?
,filipmolnar,2013-04-26T23:20Z,"You should buy the game if you like it It is a lot of fun and has a good time/money spent ratio.

Also, it constantly gets updated with new chars, features etc."
,Origination,2013-04-27T21:22Z,"This torrent sucks. The installation instructions don't really help at all. Even after looking in the comments and following (Winrar open the .001 file, then extract it, then mount it) still doesn't work. Overall this torrent is one of the most unintuitive installation processes I've ever seen in a torrent, and I've downloaded hundreds of games off of here. Created an account just to comment on how bad this torrent is."
,Pinanclee,2013-04-28T10:50Z,"Working great. thx.

After so many years ppl don't know how to use .iso its just insulting. 

So after you DL file, open it with WinRAR and unrar it somewhere, after that if you have win 7 download some mount iso software like VirtualCloneDrive or demon tools, win8 has its own mount and just right click on .bin and mount it.

After you mounted and install, just copy/overwrite steam_api.dll from FTL bin folder to install folder and you are good to go. "
,LeForejt,2013-04-30T20:14Z,Does it have autoupdates?
,kirby17,2013-05-02T11:36Z,it works great.. thanks..
,lilke10,2013-05-02T23:51Z,Thank You :)
,Babality,2013-05-03T16:35Z,Ppl pls STOP with these FLT files !!! make a simple winrar cant do sh1t with these files even with winrar 4.0 licenced :-s! Ty for the upload tho 
,dnova08,2013-05-05T09:53Z,@Origination if none of the comments helped you then you must be retarded. You don't deserve to play this game. Go back to playing with crayons and shitting yourself.
,lucarido,2013-05-05T16:37Z,"Torrent won't even start.
Error:The system cannot find path specified."
,TaiwanGuy,2013-05-06T02:18Z,"Downloaded, mounted, and installed. Then I got the steam_api.dll is missing error when I tried to run the program. I tried following Pinanclee's instructions to copy/overwrite the steam_api.dll file in the Fairlight->Bin folder on the mounted disc, but my system wont let me copy/paste that file into the install folder. 

I then tried downloading that dll file on dll-files-download dot com. I got the file and put it in the right place, but then when I open the game, it just takes me to the game page on Steam...where I can purchase the game. I still am unable to play it. 

So is the steam_api.dll file included in the torrent a different version that will allow me to play? If so, how do I copy and paste that to the install folder? Any help would be greatly appreciated."
,lourencog,2013-05-06T18:04Z,"Yeah, i have the same problem, I tried to copy the steam_api.dll file from the bin folder and my pc won´t let me, any help is well appreciated! Thanks"
,Darker.,2013-05-07T00:13Z,how can people not figure this out its not hard at all -.-
,TaiwanGuy,2013-05-07T01:54Z,"Yeah, it isn't hard at all to follow the instructions on how to install this. No problem...BUT after doing all those things successfully, some of us are having a problem playing the game. Click to start it up and there is an error. 

People who arent able to extract or mount this just arent following simple directions...but that's not where my problem is. "
,34ging34,2013-05-08T06:16Z,is anyone having a problem with graphical distortion? i followed all instructions and the game runs fine but allot of the visuals seem corrupt 
,34ging34,2013-05-08T06:38Z,oh and @taiwanguy i think your misunderstanding instructions you need to replace the steam_api.dll file in your install directory not the mounted. drive for example my install directory was C: Program filesDont StarveBin
,bashpr0mpt,2013-05-08T11:42Z,"If someone is too lazy to upload a game as anything but an image rip of the DVD in question then they don't deserve people wasting their band seeding their shit IMO.

If anyone throws up an un-AIDS version (no iso, no image, no rar (yes, rar is AIDS, it's compression compared to the lzma2 is laughable)) then hit me up."
,PlumBrendan69,2013-05-09T11:36Z,"@lucarido Make sure the 'Save In' is at a path that's on your computer, I had the same problem and realized that the path was still trying to get to my hardrive..."

,arcabir,2013-05-10T12:59Z,nvr mind...thnx anyways!!
,Linteo,2013-05-11T01:40Z,"For those who struggle with getting it installed. Simply right click the 1 file, open with, find your WinRar.exe (probably C:ProgramFiles/WinRar/Winrar.exe) open it with the winrar.exe, extract to wherever u want, than u will find the file u are looking for to mount."
