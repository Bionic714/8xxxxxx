Lieutenant O'Neil (Demi Moore), the first woman ever given the opportunity to earn a place in the armed forces' most highly skilled combat unit-the elite Navy SEALs! But the already brutal rigors of training camp turn into an unimaginable test of courage and determination once it becomes clear that no one-powerful politicians, top military brass or her male Navy SEAL teammates-wants her to succeed! A critically acclaimed triumph directed by action hitmaker Ridley Scott-you'll cheer for GI Jane as this brave soldier proves she belongs among the best of the best!
