,tdurden83,2013-04-25T00:45Z,"thx again for the myriad uploads. Is there any chance you could plz recommend a handful of them as the cream of the crop? I have been wanting to check out some less mainstream books, but there are so many and i'm unfamiliar so it's hard to decide where to start.   "
,werthamlied,2013-04-25T02:31Z,"Leonard, Thank you so much for these awesome, high-quality uploads. This is a huge contribution to the fan community, and to the world of comic researchers. // I would love to chat with you further about your interests in comic book preservation! If you're interested, you can reach me at trinitycomicresearch@gmail.com. Thanks again!!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-25T03:29Z,"tdurden83, whooo, I don't know. I'll give it a shot, but you'll have to give me a couple days to sort through everything I've uploaded, as well as some of the other stuff on TPB. Everyone's likes and dislikes are different, though, so this is a tough thing to do. If you hate my suggestions you'll just have to chalk it up to different tastes, rather than assuming everything off the beaten track is crap. lol"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-25T03:30Z,"werthamlied, you're most welcome. And thank you for the very kind comment. If you would be so kind, please give me a shout through the SuprBay (the forum link at the bottom of the page), where I am also LeonardTSpock."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T04:48Z,awesome stuff LeonardTSpock! didn't even know this book existed. thanks my friend!
,tdurden83,2013-04-25T05:13Z,"Lol, I started to add a line in my post about realizing how personal preference plays into this stuff, but deleted it halfway through. I'll be interested in checking out them out no matter what, especially if you end up digging out picks from the full tpb library. Don't worry about factoring this in if you don't want to, but here's something broad in case it helps... good artwork is always a plus, but the writing is always the most important thing for me"
,GP67,2013-04-25T08:28Z,thanks this is great 
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-25T09:02Z,"You're welcome GP 67.

And thank you all for not pointing out that I said 1993-2008 was Vertigo's 25th anniversary. P'shh! Sometimes!... lol"
,new52,2013-04-26T04:15Z,"Thank you, LeonardTSpock!"
,magznolia,2013-04-27T23:58Z,"Excellent.  Thank you. This scan is so cool I bought a copy. It's a beautiful, high quality book if you have the 30 bucks to spare."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-04-28T07:08Z,"Hey tdurden83, I'm not really hittin' the mark I'm looking for with this list creation thing. Too many books with too little information regarding what you've already read. However, I'm totally down for trying to help you out, so why don't you hit the 'Forum' link at the bottom of the page and send me a PM (I'm LeonardTSpock there as well) so we can actually converse on this subject."
,tdurden83,2013-04-30T00:39Z,"no worries man. i've been thinking about checking that forum out lately. i'd like to take you up on that once i get goin on it. as long as it's not a hassle, you put in enough work uploading on here as is"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-05-03T05:50Z,"It's not a hassle at all. If you contact me there I will respond, converse, etc."
,wileect,2013-05-28T20:23Z,Great up!! Thank you!!! For this and everything else!!
