The movie largely takes place in the 1960s. Police Major Alfredo Lim (Cesar Montano) has just been commended for being one of Manila’s ten most outstanding officers. But the celebration is cut short when one of his co-honorees is killed while trying to stop a robbery. Lim gets on the trail of this gang of criminals, carrying out a major surveillance operation. But his work takes a personal toll, his devotion to his duty causing friction in his marriage. And his righteousness ruffles the feathers of very powerful people, putting his family’s life in danger.
