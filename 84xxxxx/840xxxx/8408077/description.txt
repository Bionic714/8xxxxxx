After seeing her on the train, amateur artist Patrick becomes obsessed with Jillian. He pursues her relentlessly,

despite not knowing anything about her. He eventually wins her over, only to learn that she was the driver of the

car that ran over his mother years ago. This fact, along with other issues, causes Patrick to push Jillian away,

even as she falls in love with him. Patrick eventually learns the error of his ways, but by then,

he might be far too late.
