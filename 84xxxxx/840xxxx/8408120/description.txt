Jack Burton(Kurt Russell) , a tough talking, wisecracking truck driver whose hum drum life on the road takes a sudden supernatural tailspin when his best friend's fianc√©e is kidnapped. Speeding to the rescue, Jack finds himself deep beneath San Francisco's Chinatown, in a murky, creature filled world ruled by Lo Pan, a 2000 year old magician who mercilessly presides over an empire of spirits. Dodging demons and facing baffling terrors, Jack battles his way through Lo Pan's dark domain in a full throttle, action riddled ride to rescue the girl. Co-starring Kim Cattrall, this effects filled sci fi spectacle speeds to an incredible, twist taking finish.
