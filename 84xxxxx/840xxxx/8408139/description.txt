Jesus Christ!  Have beent testing this old and dusty driver from NVIDIA for two or three days on an eMachines T3104 with a NEC LCD1920NX monitor.  First, restore system to default to 32-bit XP (fresh install).  Then, install all drivers for your eMachines T3104 for XP.  It is very important to install all drivers that are for the eMachines first.  Now, turn off the eMachines T3104.  Unplug power first.  Push the power button to let the residual power clear out.  Open the computer case.  Install the Geforce FX 5200 AGP 8x 256MB 3D graphics card.  Close the case.  Remove the VGA cable from the old port and insert it into the Geforce slot.  Make sure it is secure.  Plug in the power cord.  Power up the computer and enter setup by lightly and repeating the F2 key.  Find the Display boot up.  It should be Init Display or something like that.  Set it to AGP.
