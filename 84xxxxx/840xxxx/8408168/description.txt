Plot:


The story is told in flashbacks as Emilio Aguinaldo thanks the US government for giving him the opportunity to attend

the full restoration of Philippine independence on July 4, 1946.

The film begins with his capture by Philippine and US forces under Frederick Funston's command in 1901,

then flashes back to 1886, when an old woman gives Aguinaldo and childhood friend Candido Tirona cryptic prophecies.

Ten years later, Aguinaldo is inducted into the Katipunan and later assumes leadership of its Cavite chapter while

becoming mayor of Cavite El Viejo. When trouble breaks out in Manila in late August 1896, Aguinaldo tries to assure

the Spanish provincial government of non-interference and covertly marshals his forces despite a lack of weapons.

Learning that the Spanish mostly put their forces in Manila, Aguinaldo finally mobilizes his troops and take the

fight to Spanish troops in Cavite.
