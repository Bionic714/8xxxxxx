A creator-owned, four-part mini series written and drawn by John Byrne.

The High Ways follows the exploits of a spirited young man named Eddie Wallace. Hungry for the brand of wild adventure only available off-planet, Eddie joins up with a crew of a rock-hopping freighter, eager to see what lies beyond the clouds. As these things tend to go, however, everything in these early days of interstellar travel isnΓÇÖt quite what it seems as intrigue and mystery abound. Byrne also stated that this story takes place in the same universe as Next Men.
