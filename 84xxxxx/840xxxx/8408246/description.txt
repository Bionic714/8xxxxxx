This is a very rare copy of a kinescope of a TV production of Waiting for Godot from 1961, starring Burgess Meredith as Vladimir, Zero Mostel as Estragon, and Kurt Kassner and Alvin Epstein reprising their roles from the 1956 production as Pozzo and Lucky. If you are not a fan of Godot yet, I recommend you d/l the Michael Lindsay-Hogg production:  http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5022917/%5B2001%5D_Waiting_for_Godot_-_Michael_Lindsay-Hogg
This copy of the kinny is a rare curiosity, rumored about but unavailable for years. The play is lightly censored for the time and TV.
