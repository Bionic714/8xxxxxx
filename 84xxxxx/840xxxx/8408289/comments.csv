,ESS00rAj,2013-04-30T19:27Z,Thank You..
,ESS00rAj,2013-04-30T19:31Z,"@k3yur

As far as i know 2013.01 is not a genuine one. It has very less number of POIs which means that its fake.
Till yesterday the latest map release was 2012.06.

But yesterday, mapmyindia has officially announced the release of v8 maps for india.

Eagerly waiting for ScorpioPirate to release the same."
,k3yur,2013-05-01T15:09Z,"@ESS00rAj: no dude thats not d case which u r telling....
""Aura"" Maps are different from ""MapmyIndia"" Maps.... we are currently using mapmyindia maps as provided by scorpio...
I used to use Aura maps in 11.0 version of sygic n they were pretty good.. so i asked 2013.01 (Aura maps) are better or mapmyIndia 2012.06.... will Aura maps will b supported in this version?"
,k3yur,2013-05-01T15:13Z,N also i m quite sure dat Aura n MapmyIndia are same company...
