More Alvin and the Chipmunks. In my opinion, some of the funniest and most entertaining cartoons from the 80's. These are ripped from six separate dvd's. They are: Christmas with the Chipmunks, Driving Dave Crazy, Easter Collection, Halloween Collection, The Chipette Diaries, and the Valentine Collection.

Please note that several dvd's have repeat episodes. If you see that a certain DVD is "missing" an episode, it will be somewhere in this torrent, or my other original Chipmunk torrent somewhere. 

I hope you all enjoy the magic of Alvin and the Chipmunks!
