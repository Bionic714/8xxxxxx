and it's over 19 GB.  A torrent this size is gonna 
take forever to seed!  Good thing I've seen them all before..... and if these are from VHS copies off-air from the early 1990s the video quality probably won't be that good anyway."

And I'm not on to usually complain, especially with an uploader like TvT, I know your hands are quite full. I'm just always eager to get any howard stern as all these wannabe scene kids gotta keep their rips locked up on stupid private sites for god knows what reason when it could just be shared here where there's plenty of stern fans.
