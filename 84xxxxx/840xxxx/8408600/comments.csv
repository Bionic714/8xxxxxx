,bidawi,2013-04-25T23:57Z,"Do a search for a torrent with the library (Mar or PC, both will work), download and follow instructions to install."
,Dr. Howard,2013-04-26T00:46Z,"Just To Verify, I grabbed a pc dl, and unstuffed the factory library.iso. I placed the entire folder- B4 Factory Library on my external drive. Installed this app, then opened Preferences, Library, and created a path to my new location (couldn't use Factory; had to create under User).. It automatically scanned and all the kits appeared under User! Sweet!"
,desiemmett,2013-04-26T18:28Z,"Cool, thanks to you both!"
,explojoseph,2013-05-10T04:21Z,"seriously WHAT THE FUCK is this shit. its a standard install, yet it donest install the library to the correct folder. i honestly have NO idea where the fuck it is. i mean, theres a folder NAMED kits in battery where it SHOULD be located. but its not. why. how do you fuck that up. i did a search of my mac and i still cant find it. dr. howard claims he found it, i dont understand what hes talking about though. anyone, can you help. because whoever cracked this is a fucking moron."
,explojoseph,2013-05-10T04:27Z,"ok i think i get it. this doesnt come with a goddamn library. PLEASE, tell me. what goddamn use is a VST without a fuckin library. uploader, your a waste of space and time. try out your software before you upload you douchebag."
,explojoseph,2013-05-10T04:31Z,"ok, so to be of help to other people. what i believe you can do is either find a better upload or:

you can download this torrent. then find a windows version with the library. exatract it and take the library. delete the other contents. then move your library into documents/native instruments/battery 4/kits.

then open your daw, load battery, and navigate to that folder.

this shits fucking ridiculous. i seriously cant possibly fathom why someone would upload this without the kits. fucking retarded"
,jimmay,2013-05-20T16:56Z,"Clearly a lot of kids here who are new to this. This is a ""torrent"" for Native Instruments Battery 4. Native Instruments is the name of the company, and Battery 4 is the product. A quick search on the internet (you do that a lot don't you?) will quickly tell you that this application is ""4.6 GB for complete installation"" (Native Instruments.) This torrent upload boasts a file of ""Size: 229.13mb."" Clearly that's a LOT LESS than the actual file size. Which would mean that the application itself is 229.13mb, and the library is 4,370.87mb.

What is a library anyway? You don't really need a factory library... it's just a bunch of folders full of factory samples. You could use your own sample libraries with Battery. Battery is an excellent sample manipulation tool that's been around for a VERY long time. But kids nowadays wipe their asses with plugins like they're nothing. You want to press a button and suddenly you're a millionaire producer.

You can get the library elsewhere on a PC torrent. Please try to appreciate the uploader's effort and the risk she puts herself in by posting these torrents. You should thank her for making this software available to you (ESPECIALLY for a Mac version, which are scarce at times.)

If none of the kids will do it, I'll say THANK YOU to the poster for on behalf of myself and everyone. Please continue to provide Mac versions for us of great software.

Don't worry, the scene is still here, we just have to hide a little more these days. We'll be here for your music and art. 94'"
