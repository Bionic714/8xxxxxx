,DarkNewb,2013-04-25T03:27Z,why upload something there all ready is free to play
,NokTham,2013-04-25T03:51Z,"if you read the description you'll see why, downloading from file hosting websites can be a pain in the ass, specially when u have to wait 30 minutes to download another file, after you've downloaded a previous one... i don't care if it's free to play, it's not the reason that took me to upload the files in here... if u don't want to download it, then fuck off (with all the respect), because that's is a pretty stupid ass comment, you seem to be the kind of guy that associates Torrents with Piracy, well in that case you are wrong my friend. What i want to give users with this upload? NO waiting time and GREAT download speeds... Torrents are the future sharing system! BTW if you're going to download it, HELP SEEDING! Thank You!"
,DarkNewb,2013-04-26T11:27Z,"what ...... you must have a Jerk internet speed....

i can download Ragnarok online under 10 min

not all Jerk got your type of internet speed"
,NokTham,2013-04-27T02:53Z,"so if you can download ragnarok online in 10 minutes (that's too long btw), what the fuck are you doing here? if you got some kind of problem with the fact that i uploaded this in here, i suggest you go fuck yourself (with all the respect again). If you're going to make use of it, go ahead and btw, help seed, otherwise get a fucking life, you make that comment in every ""free"" software torrent? or ur just in love with me?........ "
,NokTham,2013-04-27T02:54Z,i think i might start upload free softwares in here just to make you shut the fuck up
,Hinotama,2013-05-17T15:07Z,"Just ignore him. :v

,mucdani,2013-06-10T23:59Z,"Thank you man for this upload! :) I have quite fast net, but somehow my download from official site is DAMN slow, so this is a lot faster and it will save me some precious time. Thanks again and dont listen to stupid haters :)"
