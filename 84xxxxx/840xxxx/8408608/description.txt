                                Release Notes 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
This package contains the following games. All have icons and backgrounds, most 
also have audio for the XMB as well. Some are custom HQ art as the ones that 
came with the PSP game looked horrible on the PS3 so I used hi-res art work to 
make new icons and backgrounds. I think you will be happy with them all as I 
think they look marvelous. 

All retain their orignal Content ID given by Sony so 
no conflicts will happen during install and all can be installed at one time no 
problems there. Saves work on all games and test using Rebug 4.30.2 CFW but will 
work on any CFW. 

I have been told however 3.41 & 3.55 saves will not work but 
any 4.XX CFW they will save just fine. I made this pack as I had so many I 
needed to catch up and by the time this is seeded hopefull the next pack will be 
ready. So stick with it and you will get some great games to play on your PS3.
