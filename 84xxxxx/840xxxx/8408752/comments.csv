so if you're having problems, I'll come back
in about 6 to 8 hours to seed it some more, 
I'm seeding The Damned one I did now."

3 to 7 days, so I'll come back then and seed
this some more since the files are still there,
as long as the new PSU fixes it !  I know some
people really want this, so I'll make sure I
get back to seeding it no matter what."
