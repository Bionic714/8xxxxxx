I paid for this movie strictly so I could share it with the people.  I find it absolutely ridiculous a film that was funded by the people is pay to watch.  This movie deserves to be freely accessible by everyone, not removed from sharing sites like Youtube and so on.

I also find it funny this movie preaches against the rich keeping people from free information and intuitive developments, yet they themselves are suppressing the information you and I payed to have, but only at a cost.

I encoded this video at a high compression rate while preserving quality.

Please read the "PLEASE READ!" file!


I hope you enjoy this FREE release!
