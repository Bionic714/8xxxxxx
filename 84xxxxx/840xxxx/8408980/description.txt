Here is another of the BEST of crooners. I absolutely love this guys style, voice, writing...CLASSIC. Mr. Downing returns with a new CD called SILVER where he puts his vocal/musical talents on display. Here you will find a number of new cuts as well as some remakes. I love it all.

Silver is to commemorate 25 years of Will Downing being in the Music Industry. Instead of putting together a "Best of" project Will decided to take songs from the limited edition YESTERDAY, TODAY & TOMORROW projects, record 4 brand new songs plus include a live rehearsal of 3 classic Will Downing songs ("I go Crazy,"Wishing on a star" & I Try") All 3 songs taken from the early part of his career and all three classic songs that if he doesn't do live in his shows ends up in Mass hysteria!!! So you get the best of Classic and new material from this timeless artist.
