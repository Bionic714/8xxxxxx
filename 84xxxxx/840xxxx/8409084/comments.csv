,humpahoe,2013-04-25T16:30Z,anyone know if this shit is real?
,dynasty247,2013-04-25T17:02Z,It's real but audio is out of sync and video leaves much to be desired. The included screen shows HD quality but the video is much crappier and not HD. It's in MP4 720x480 format and really distorted.
,beechyboy,2013-04-25T17:18Z,"That's why I NEVER download any TvTeam's uploads unless there is nothing else to download.
They NEVER put any video info in their uploads.
Like I said before, WAIT for Killers to upload this final seasons episode."
,nic198419,2013-04-25T19:05Z,you would think since it's the season finale that KILLERS would have put it up by now. Don't wanna dl this crappy version
,Garyhall,2013-04-25T19:28Z,"NY2 just released a DSR (digital satellite receiver) 
It's better than this by a long shot, but it is not nearly as good as Killers release will be.
Like BeechyBoy said "" wait for Killers version ""  
Be patient!"

,Garyhall,2013-04-25T21:30Z,"DSR from NY2 is always Interlaced.
Wait for Killers version.  It is ALWAYS the best quality."
,NothingButKush,2013-04-25T22:08Z,"According to TV guide sites this is not the finale, there are 16 episodes this season. Its not the last season either, why would they end it now, there will be at least a couple more seasons."
,Garyhall,2013-04-25T23:04Z,"It is SEASON 3 finale. No one said it,s the last season!  READ THIS

,nic198419,2013-04-26T00:10Z,This is the SEASON finale not series finale. I assure you there are not 16 episodes in this season there are only 13
,Mr_Heisenberg,2013-04-27T05:46Z,"yea only 13 episodes in this season event though tvrage.com said 16 last week. The quality of this rip is awful though, avoid this one. Get the 480p msd rip from tvteam, way better"
