Plot:


Juan Dela Cruz is the story of an unlikely hero.
He is an orphan boy brought up in the church by a righteous parish priest,
Father Cito, who guided him towards goodness.

But because he had an innate temper, the pruddish townspeople disliked him
except the priest whom he regarded as his father.

One day the priest was killed by a thief. Juan ended up in the streets of Quiapo,
as a simple, kind and yet tough young man.

Unknown to him, he is half aswang, the son of Samuel Alejandro, the Haring Aswang
and also the prophesied Anak ng Dilim.

He is fated to rule over his kind and take over the human race.
But his mother, Amelia, is a Tagabantay, coming from an ancient lineage of defenders
using the Bakal na Krus to destroy the Aswangs.

How can Juan fulfill his destiny as the next Tagabantay while struggling against his
nature as an Aswang--- a creature he is also destined to destroy?

This is the story of the fight between good and evil that also happens inside all of us.
