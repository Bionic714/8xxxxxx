Confession Of Murder 2012 BRRip 720p x264 Korean ESubs - PRiSTiNE [P2PDL]

Genre: Action | Thriller
Plot: After the statute of limitation expires on the 
murders he has committed, Lee Du-seok publishes an 
autobiography describing all his murders in great 
detail. Detective Choi, who investigated Lee's murders 
15 years ago starts the chase once again and Han Ji-soo, 
who lost her daughter to Lee, pledges vengeance. 
Meanwhile, another killer appears, casting doubt to 
whether Lee is the real serial killer. The key here 
is how well the story juggles the truth and how solid 
the description of the characters' tangled relationships is.
