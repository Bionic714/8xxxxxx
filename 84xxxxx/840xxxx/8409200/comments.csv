Enjoy tomorrow's NBC episode today courtesy of CityTV in Canada

Note: We skipped E04 and are tagging this as E05 because as fans of the show
know NBC/City have pulled the 4th episode at the producers request. It will
however air internationally, hopefully someone can fill in the gap when that
happens

[V],psspss,2013-04-25T08:31Z,"they skipped ep4 cos they didnt want to upset the public since the bombings how lame is that
people have the right to turn of the darn tv if upsets them.. now you have to wait for overseas rippers to source it .. kinda ruins the back story plot now with lecter"
,cindy25,2013-04-25T08:32Z,"The series fourth episode, ""Œuf"", which revolved around kidnapped children who had been brainwashed into murdering their own former families, was pulled from the schedule at the request of creator Bryan Fuller. The episode will still be broadcast in other countries."
,Pakosan,2013-04-25T09:27Z,thnx ettv for the upload and the info on the missing episode
,Nayati13,2013-04-25T15:37Z,"According to Wikipedia...

Let's hope someone's on the ball here when that happens. :) Thanks for the uploads! "
