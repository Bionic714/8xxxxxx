The uncut ep. 4 will air on AXN Asia on 4/30.
Let's hope someone's on the ball here when that happens. :) Thanks for the uploads!"
,Feelmaster,2013-04-25T22:41Z,Why did they pulled the e04?
,IndigoAK,2013-04-26T06:30Z,"@Feelmaster: Bryan Fuller, the show's creator, asked NBC to pull the episode after the Boston Marathon bombings because it deals with a woman brainwashing kids and using them to kill people.  He was concerned that after Newtown and Boston, it might hit a little to close to home for people in the States."
