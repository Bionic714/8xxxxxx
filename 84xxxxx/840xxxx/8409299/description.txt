A new and revised edition of the most comprehensive single-volume dictionary available on mathematics. With over 9000 definitions and 400 diagrams, this is the one dictionary of mathematics any student of the subject will ever need.
Covering an enormous range of technical terms from both pure and applied mathematics, this superb reference goes beyond basic definitions to provide helpful explanations and examples.
The thoroughness of this dictionary makes it great both for browsers and for real mathematicians. I can't imagine anyone outgrowing this work. If anything better comes along to take this book's place, odds are it will be the next edition.
