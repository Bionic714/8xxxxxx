Overview
NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER

From the former vice president and #1 New York Times bestselling author comes An Inconvenient Truth for everythingΓÇöa frank and clear-eyed assessment of six critical drivers of global change in the decades to come.

Ours is a time of revolutionary change that has no precedent in history. With the same passion he brought to the challenge of climate change, and with his decades of experience on the front lines of global policy, Al Gore surveys our planetΓÇÖs beclouded horizon and offers a sober, learned, and ultimately hopeful forecast in the visionary tradition of Alvin TofflerΓÇÖs Future Shock and John NaisbittΓÇÖs Megatrends. In The Future, Gore identifies the emerging forces that are reshaping our world:

ΓÇó Ever-increasing economic globalization has led to the emergence of what he labels ΓÇ£Earth Inc.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöan integrated holistic entity with a new and different relationship to capital, labor, consumer markets, and national governments than in the past.
ΓÇó The worldwide digital communications, Internet, and computer revolutions have led to the emergence of ΓÇ£the Global Mind,ΓÇ¥ which links the thoughts and feelings of billions of people and connects intelligent machines, robots, ubiquitous sensors, and databases.
ΓÇó The balance of global political, economic, and military power is shifting more profoundly than at any time in the last five hundred yearsΓÇöfrom a U.S.-centered system to one with multiple emerging centers of power, from nation-states to private actors, and from political systems to markets.
ΓÇó A deeply flawed economic compass is leading us to unsustainable growth in consumption, pollution flows, and depletion of the planetΓÇÖs strategic resources of topsoil, freshwater, and living species.
ΓÇó Genomic, biotechnology, neuroscience, and life sciences revolutions are radically transforming the fields of medicine, agriculture, and molecular scienceΓÇöand are putting control of evolution in human hands.
ΓÇó There has been a radical disruption of the relationship between human beings and the earthΓÇÖs ecosystems, along with the beginning of a revolutionary transformation of energy systems, agriculture, transportation, and construction worldwide.

From his earliest days in public life, Al Gore has been warning us of the promise and peril of emergent truthsΓÇöno matter how ΓÇ£inconvenientΓÇ¥ they may seem to be. As absorbing as it is visionary, The Future is a map of the world to come, from a man who has looked ahead before and been proven all too right.
