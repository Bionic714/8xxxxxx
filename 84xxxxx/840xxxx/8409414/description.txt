This title covers virtually everything related to mobile robots - destined to become the definitive work on robot mechanisms. It discusses the manipulators, grippers, and mechanical sensors used in mobile robotics, and includes never before compiled material on high-mobility suspension and drivetrains. Motor control section is written for those who don't have an advanced electrical understanding. It is a must read for anyone interested in the field of high-mobility vehicles.

The Ultimate Mobile Robot Mechanical Design Reference
Both hobbyists and professionals will treasure this unique and distinctive sourcebook -- the most thorough -- and thoroughly explained -- compendium of robot mechanisms and devices ever assembled. Written and illustrated specifically for people fascinated with mobile robots, Robot Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Illustrated offers a one-stop source for everything needed for the mechanical design of state-of-the-art mobile 'bots.

New Mechanisms, New Systems, New Devices

Written by a leading robot designer -- designer of robots used at the horizon of mobile robotics -- this resource offers a collection of both new and classic robotic mechanisms and devices unmatched in scope, from such high-level sources as the mechanical engineers' mainstay, Mechanisms and Mechanical Devices Illustrated.
