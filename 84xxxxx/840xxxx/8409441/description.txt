This work looks under the hood of all robotic projects, stimulating teachers, students, and hobbyists to learn more about the gamut of areas associated with control systems and robotics. It offers a unique presentation in providing both theory and philosophy in a technical yet entertaining way.


Reading Anatomy of a Robot is like having a robot on the operating room table. Crack open the pages, and youΓÇÖll be able to dissect a robot from head to toeΓÇöor from project management and design to motors and power systems.

Discover how robots articulate movements, how they see and hear, what gives them their power, and, at times, their gentleness. Delve into the robotΓÇÖs ΓÇ£brains,ΓÇ¥ and learn how experienced robot designers use control systems to make their machines think.

Much more than an enumeration of parts, Anatomy of a Robot exposes the life and human creativity behind todayΓÇÖs robot. Always entertaining, this exceptional book takes you deep inside the theory and craft, philosophy and science of robotics. Coverage ranges from control systems and computer hardware to ΓÇ£nuts and boltsΓÇ¥ topics such as actuators and mechanics, with plenty of humor and mathematical equations to help with the anatomy lesson.

A must for robot professionals and serious robot hobbyists, and a treat for science lovers and teachers, Anatomy of a Robot is a journey inside one of todayΓÇÖs most exciting and fast-moving disciplines.
