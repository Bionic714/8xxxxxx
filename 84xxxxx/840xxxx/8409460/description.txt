From Comedy Central producer Tom Akel comes the misadventures of Dust and Wormhole, two twenty-somethings who possess the powers to go anywhere but are more interested in unlocking the nude code in Tomb Raider than saving the day. Along the way they'll battle ex-roommate Dirt, current roommate Hans, Wormhole's addiction to tequila, and Tom's inability to write a coherent script.
