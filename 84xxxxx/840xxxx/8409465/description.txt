Safe

Whether you need to do two-dimensional finite element computations in plane stress, plane strain, or axial symmetry, Safe takes care of it. The smart geotechnical finite element analysis software identifies pore pressures and effective stresses separately and includes gravitational loads and initial stresses.

Safe Benefits

Fully coupled consolidation included as a standard
Advanced post processing for plotting, visual results inspection and report outputs
Extensive range of material models ΓÇô including jointed rock, reinforced soil, BRICK material model, elastic ΓÇô mohr coulomb and many others

Features:

Analysis of plane stress, plane strain or axially symmetric problems. General loading of linear elastic axisymmetric structures can be carried out using a Fourier series technique.
Linear or non-linear behaviour
Gravity loading
Pore pressures and effective stresses are identified separately, allowing computation for drained or undrained conditions, and time dependent consolidation
Incremental loading and changes of material properties, permitting the formation of excavations, embankments etc.
Intermediate results can be stored and inspected before the problem is continued further.
Pressure (distributed) and line loading
Fixed or spring restraints
8 noded quadrilateral elements. These can be curvilinear
Consolidation problems
Wells
Seepage and flow
Extensive graphical input options and in-built mesh generation facility
Wide range of graphical output and printing facilities
