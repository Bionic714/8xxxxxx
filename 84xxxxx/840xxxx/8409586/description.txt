Looking into the Earth comprehensively describes the principles and applications of both "global" and "exploration" geophysics on all scales. It forms an introduction to geophysics for geologists, civil engineers, environmental scientists, and field archaeologists. The book is organized into two parts: Part 1 describes the geophysical methods, while Part 2 illustrates their use in a number of extended case histories. Mussett and Khan introduce mathematical and physical principles at an elementary level, and then develop them as necessary. Student questions and exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Written for introductory and intermediate level courses in geology, earth science, environmental science, and engineering, this is also an excellent introductory textbook in geophysics.
