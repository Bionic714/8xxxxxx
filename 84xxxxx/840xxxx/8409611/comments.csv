,HKCannibal,2013-04-25T14:18Z,Thanks a lot eztv!
,123girl,2013-04-25T15:15Z,"Thanks for all your hard work, I appreciate everything that you put up, just asking is there a episode 4 of Hannibal :-)"
,Nayati13,2013-04-25T15:36Z,"According to Wikipedia...
The uncut ep. 4 will air on AXN Asia on 4/30.
Let's hope someone's on the ball here when that happens. :) Thanks for the uploads!"
,thc404,2013-04-25T16:30Z,"This serie is a mess... It wasn't bad, but if they are starting like this after only 3 episodes, I'm abandoning ship.

Thanks for the upload anyways!"
,smartcunt,2013-04-25T17:54Z,"everyone cool your jets, they were pressured to not release ep.4 due to the proximity of its release with the boston bombings, and the inference of child killing in the show. not their fault. watch the webisodes on NBC or on youtube and you'll be sweet."
,jonaslorik,2013-04-25T18:08Z,yah. idk really. I think mads mikkelsen and hugh dancys performances are really good and the show in general too. just sad they had to pull this episode. -_-

1x04 -- Apr 25, 2013 -- Ceuf -- PULLED - UNAIRED

Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the 
Boston Marathon bombings. Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com 
(nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/). The webisodes will serve as a bridge 
between Episode 3 and Episode 5. 

The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not yet know when or where.

,botoxbutox,2013-04-28T05:11Z,"It is sad but amusing how some episodes of a new ""edgy"" US show are pulled because they are ""too violent"" or ""hit too close to home"". Yet they are still released overseas. Is this a marketing scam? 
What does that say about the US? Why subject the rest of the world to this material if it is too violent, then? Will watching this kind of media predispose the viewer to violent acts, such as battery, murder and cannibalism?"
,electricblooded,2013-04-28T16:23Z,Yay!!! two episodes at once...!!!!

,coute,2013-05-21T03:38Z,"Guys, this show is in trouble! If you like it, please consider watching it on tv or Hulu! This is not an anti-piracy message, I DO download this series as well because I can get it faster and at better quality through torrent but I also go and watch it on Hulu later to increase the ratings. I just really love this show and would hate to see it cancelled! Support Hannibal!"
