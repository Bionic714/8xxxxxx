on well.. the Philadelphia presentation had some good content.. still all very non provable.. but a good story non the less"
[V],psspss,2013-04-25T11:23Z,"opps extra dot in one of filenames and missed M in experiment for Kelley one..

correct when get them for your collections..

LONG names used.. so again download to root folder else windows will fook you and not play or move them etc"
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T08:36Z,"so many hit and runs going on..

I dont believe everyone that downloaded shared back 1 to 1 ratio alone the recommended 1.3-1.5 ratio to keep a torrent alive"
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T09:33Z,"some of the vids are done via handheld camera and poorly done but the content on some are interesting

but a must listen to is this one.. fanscinating
The Flatwoods Monster Case - Ivan Sandersons 1953 report_RadioChat_with_Photos_Apr2012_37min.xvid

then listen to the others on the same subject"
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T11:42Z,hmm I have another big collection of UFO goodies 10 things atleast coming but I cant afford the gigs all the time i for sure will run out 3rd week of my data cap month again

and again the simple coil lighting a bulb is a trick

basically its wireless power.. not free energy

a bigger coil with higher voltage is close by the person under table like.. and the small coil is induced a current .. closer the coils the better
power transfer.. this what tesla was working on
how to capture power from air and also amp it up so devices could connect to it over bigger distances


(as someone on the c2cam chat with steven asked!) just have to google to find this out"
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T16:24Z,"the next big ufo bundle is up.. full of goodies you will not want to miss out grabbing and watching

although Im still watching this bundle myself.. this has been a very good collection also

,tractys9,2013-05-11T15:45Z,"I'm so sick of hearing about how Tesla knew about induction and free energy.  GUESS WHAT, induction is a very simple electrical property discovered by FARADAY well before Tesla was born.  And, the induction coil was invented by Nicholas Callan in 1836, also well before Tesla was born.  Tesla did not design the first AC generator - many 2 phase generators were used in Europe, and after the more efficient 3-phase generator was designed only a few years later Tesla stayed stuck in his less efficient 2-phase system.  Tesla's theories on free energy (and ""grabbing energy from the air"" had nothing to do with induction coils, it involved using the Earth's ground as an infinite source of negatively charged ions, and cosmic rays as a force to get the electrons to flow - a system no engineer to date has been able to successfully implement.  Don't get me wrong, he was an amazing man - a true genius in electrical engineering.  It's just ridiculous the claims made that he was a wizard, and the misattributed discoveries.  If you're really interested in engineering and science (and not fooled by the media's portrayal of the Edison/Tesla conflict,) I recommend visiting the  Deutsches Museum in Munich where many of the original first motors and dynamos are on display with accurate listings of attributions"
[V],psspss,2013-05-17T16:16Z,"Tesla did have like a 1000 patients.. he was a genius and pioneer that changed the world.. he might not have designed AC but he certainly brought it to attention of the right people.. so manhy stole his ideas too claiming theirs.

as for free energy.. he designed the spark gap  radiant energy where more energy was produced

have a watch of the video called Peter Lindenman cold electricity for one

and also Docus like Tesla the man who lit the world"
