""What Lies Below"" centers around a young female team of cave explorers that will travel to any location on the planet Earth to passionately explore and document the millions of uncharted miles of caves that rest beneath our feet, much of which has never been seen or tread on by mankind. Each member of our team comes with a specialty that will be used to make scientific discoveries, map uncharted territories, discover new species of animal life, and uncover fantastic wonders never before seen. Our team leader and expert caver is Nancy Aulenbach, who says her first caving experience was in-utero, while still in her mother's womb and has not stopped since. She will lead biologist Dr. Jean Krejca, and geologist Andrea Croskrey MSc, who are all renowned experts in the field of cave exploration. Narrated By Andy Geller

3)  The Sun 
Nothing less than all life on earth gets its energy from the rays of the sun. Our very existence relies on the Sun's unique size, temperature, and location. Yet, with so much depending on it, you'd think we'd have a better understanding of this, our planet nearest star. The truth is that the Sun is still a mystery - one that has always driven, and continues to drive, scientific inquiry and ingenuity. Why, against logic, is the sun atmosphere hotter than its surface? Why does its magnetic field reverse every 11 years? Why do the thousands of violent eruptions on its surface virtually and suddenly stop like clockwork every 70 years? And what will happen to Earth in 5 billion years when the sun consumes all its fuel, and burns out? Narrated By Ed Hopkins

4)  Fearless Planet 
4.56 billion years ago, a planet the size of Mars collided with our Earth. It set off a chain of events that would transform the Earth from a lifeless wasteland into the fertile, blue planet we know today. This is that story. Our intrepid team of scientists gets hands-on with the evidence to find out how volcanic eruptions, collisions with comets and the unstoppable drift of the continents across the globe have combined to push up some of the most spectacular landscapes in the world. In this epic tale, we shall learn how life has survived catastrophe after catastrophe to emerge ever stronger in a constantly changing world. Narrated By Simon Kerr

5)  Sunrise Earth 
Coast Guard Beach, Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts. From the place where the Mayflower made her first landfall in the New World, we stand at the beginning of what Henry David Thoreau called ""The Great Beach."" Here along the backside of Cape Cod, the sun's orb rises directly over an endless Atlantic Ocean swell. But not today, a day when the vestige of a fierce Atlantic storm sends a crashing surf onto the beach. Waves, wind, and sand dance together, alternately eroding the coastline and building the dunes back up. Shorebirds, seals, a lone surfer, and distant surfcasting fishermen search frigid waters for fish, as waves pound the shoreline slope. No Narration

6)  Faces of Earth 
From the Pacific Northwest to the shores of the Atlantic seaboard, the breadth and scope of America is like no other place on Earth. The land we see today was shaped over hundreds of millions of years. Guided by leading geoscientists, and with the aid of dramatic special effects and animations, we unravel the mysteries of continent-building and the almost unimaginable span of geologic time. Using high tech science tools and even Ultralight aircraft, viewers will travel with geoscientists as we discover America's prominent geologic features and how they formed. Narrated By Maurice Lamarche

7)  If We Had No Moon 
Without the moon, we wouldn't exist. Life, if it had started at all, would be in the earliest stages of evolution. Days would last four hours, winds would blow at hurricane-force and there'd be a dense and toxic atmosphere resembling the runaway greenhouse effect of hell-like Venus. What luck that 50 million years after the formation of the solar system, our proto-planet is smacked by a planetesimals more than twice the size of Mars. From that mother-of-"
