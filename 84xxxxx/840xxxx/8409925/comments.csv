I had an issue with Neera in Baldur's Gate where she stucked with a dialog. Hope that bug have been fixed."

,ojalord,2013-04-27T18:43Z,"@hagehun the version is mentioned in description. AFAIK, this is the latest update (compare versions of the other PC releases of BGEE on this site)"
,jaboolyman,2013-05-10T19:16Z,"Does this work on PC too, or just mac. If not, then would someone make one for pc"
,ojalord,2013-05-13T19:28Z,"@jaboolyman, ""Games > Mac"" is pretty self-explanatory. As for windows versions, try here: http://thepiratebay.sx/search/baldurs%20gate%20enhanced/0/7/0"
