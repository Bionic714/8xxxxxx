This program Friday 04-25-2013: Ioannis Kasoulides - Foreign Minister of Cyprus

Stephen Sackur talks to Cyprus foreign minister Ioannis Kasoulides, asking who and what will save the country.

Cyprus is enduring the agonies of a financial and economic meltdown. But the really bad news for the Cypriot people according to international economists is that their darkest days have yet to come.
