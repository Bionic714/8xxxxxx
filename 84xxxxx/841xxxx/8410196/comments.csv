,Jmw_9,2013-04-29T22:17Z,I Have a couple of Questions will it Read ALLL of my Nexus Expansions and VSTs..(31 of them)..does it read Nexus 2.2 and Up...and will I lose all of my recent projects from FL Stu.10..?Also is it Gonna replace my FL Stu.10?Because i just want Part 11 to be just its own proGram
,Jmw_9,2013-04-30T00:03Z,I believe I have now answered my previous questions..Its pretty simple folks..Dont replace anything from FL Stu.10..Just install FL Stu.11. and before you press Next at the Reg.Key screen..Go to the Reg key in the FL11 File from this torrent..and Successfully install the Reg Key..
,Jmw_9,2013-04-30T00:04Z,I Hate lookin at the DEMO Bullshit..So just install your Reg.Key before you press next..And wuaaala..Open FL11 Producer Edition..NO Demo..This is a Great torrent..COUNT UP!
,DBMiko,2013-04-30T15:51Z,It started working for me for about 5 days then the demo message started playing right out of the blue today.Ive done everything jm_9 told me to do & now its not working AT ALL!!!Can somebody please help me???
,Jmw_9,2013-05-02T03:03Z,"@DBMiko the best thing i can tell you to do is Reinstall..and if you already had fl 10 then just select ""Already current User""...if not then don't..Remember uninstall ""all"" components and then any stuff that didnt delete..do it manually..Then read through my steps one more time..It should work "
,Vandita,2013-05-03T14:04Z,Ichigo Hoshimiya. Can I take that off?
,bandwagon,2013-05-04T14:21Z,"Should FL STUDIO 10 be uninstalled to install this?

Thanks!"
,Kao24,2013-05-05T22:22Z,"Awesome, no problems so far. "
,andyveale,2013-05-19T21:27Z,"AWESOME!!! 
No need to uninstall FL Studio 10!  Disconnect from your internet first! Right click the install file downloaded here, run it as administrator.  When you get to the screen that asks you if you want to install it for ALL users or the current user only, go back to the files that you just downloaded and go into the Reg Key folder.  Double-click the FLRegKey file and accept registry changes.  Then go back to the installer and click next.

When the install finishes, un-check the ""run FL Studio 11"" button.  Just to be safe, I double-clicked the FLRegKey file again to re-apply changes to the registry.  Then I opened FL Studio 11 and it is WORKING LIKE A CHARM!!!!!!!"
