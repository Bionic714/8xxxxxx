New Plugins

Effector was introduced to compliment Performance Mode and is perfect for use with multi-touch displays & controllers.
- Patcher - Introduced with FL Studio 10 to provide a means of saving and recalling commonly used effects and plugin chains. ItΓÇÖs in the new section as, aside from being overhauled with animated connections and a fresh interface, patcher has gained two, of many more to come, Voice Effects (VFX).
