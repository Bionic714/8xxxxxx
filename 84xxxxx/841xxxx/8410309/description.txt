Rare recordings from the mid 1950s of the Ballet Theatre Orchestra, conducted by Joseph Levine, playing scores to two historic Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre) classics: Leonard Bernstein's "Fancy Free" (choreographed by Jerome Robbins) and Aaron Copland's "Rodeo" (choreographed by Agnes de Mille). There are many recordings of these pieces but these are unique in representing the music as it was danced to. Originally issued on Capitol Records, both recordings are monaural.
