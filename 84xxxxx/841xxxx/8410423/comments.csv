,caliapbogdan,2013-04-25T20:53Z,"    I inserted an SD card in a GO 920 not realizing it contained a system file with a higher bootloader. The next time I started the TT it immediately bricked. All I've got is the green light. No start-up screen. Reset doesn't work. Can't connect to a PC. Any hope or do I toss the TT and file this under lesson learned?

 do not throw it ... do a quick format of the two, the sd t tt, looking for a copy it in the tt navcore and maps on the sd, you will work again."
