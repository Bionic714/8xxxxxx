This archive contains a fully patched and cracked version of Age of Mythology. Just extract and run. Includes all the sound and music but NOT the videos to conserve space.

The game itself is untouched. Multiplayer via Hamachi doesn't always work perfectly. I recommend portforwarding and using external IP's.

1. Extract

2. Go to startupuser.cfg

3. Change your resolution at the xres= and yres= entries
f.e. if your resolution is 1366x768, apply:
xres=1366
yres=768

4. If you're going to play multiplayer, 
enter your external or Hamachi IP in the OverrideAddress entry 
between the "".

5. Enjoy!

NOTE: Every time you change the settings in-game your resolution will change. Restart AoM to fix this.
