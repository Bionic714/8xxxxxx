,Bellcho,2013-04-25T18:14Z,Thanks a lot from Colombia. It's really crappy that they block some countries. 
,RussianT,2013-04-25T18:53Z,"This is some sick shit what they made with E04

Thank you for uploading from Russia"
,oBomba,2013-04-25T19:22Z,The title is Oeuf not Ceuf. It is French for Egg. Many thanks for the upload.
,Feetback,2013-04-25T19:29Z,sitting eating more garbage to watch - LOLL
,lizardomanson,2013-04-25T20:55Z,This is not episode 4 or is not complete. Episode 4 was pulled off and skipped to episode 5. The unaired episode 4 (United States) will be air on Asia and other countries around 30th of this month.
,georgesteel32,2013-04-25T22:43Z,"when i find out to what happen to e4 get to nbc.com but from my country wasnt able to watch.i was looking forward for an upload and now thanks to axekitty.thanks.
lizardomanson read the comments of the uploader first."
,axekitty,2013-04-26T00:28Z,"hi everyone, this IS the official S01E04 aired on NBC, @lizardomanson search it on youtube uploaded by the official NBC. I used a vpn to bypass the block and downloaded the parts in 1080p. "
,axekitty,2013-04-26T01:19Z,guys let me know if there are any problems. will be seeding for as long :)
,axekitty,2013-04-26T01:22Z,@oBomba hmm but everyone is naming it Ceuf too?
,Diedelmon,2013-04-26T07:08Z,"Lizardomanson is kinda right. The whole episode will air on other countries. The webisodes are only part of it. So they're half the thing. 
I guess we have to wait from our fellas. "
,axekitty,2013-04-26T11:12Z,"@diedelmon prolly yes BUT you still have to watch this before you could continue with S01E05 yeah? rather than watching it first then waiting? they're webisodes because they cut out half of the scenes, but in actual fact they still were the official ep before the Boston bombings. hence the continuity of this ep is still necessary. :) "
,karimbaraka,2013-04-26T14:18Z,Thanks
,hassan43,2013-04-26T17:25Z,"Why is it in 6 parts?

My LG smart TV won't even load the file.

Not very smart if you ask me"
,suecanada,2013-04-26T21:24Z,If you download this episode from this site it is a virus! thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8410604/ 
,axekitty,2013-04-26T23:11Z,"@hassan43 firstly. NBC released this in 6 parts. it would take me longer to combine all 6 aint it. 

my priority was to get the ep up & available ASAP for people who are patiently waiting to watch this before continuing with S01E05 Coquilles. most who are downloading should be Hannibal fans like me who can't wait any second longer. 

I'm sure you can connect your computer to your HDTV, then open the folder to watch each part? :)"
,axekitty,2013-04-26T23:14Z,"@suecanada 632 SE and 141 LE, why would people seed an infected torrent? go away. "
,Beastie143,2013-04-27T00:10Z,"It may not BE a virus,but it does exhibit some virus-like behavior. When I opened it in VLC media player,I couldn't CLOSE the player or CTR/ALT/DEL my way out...had to force a shutdown. D/Loaders beware !"
,axekitty,2013-04-27T13:09Z,@beastie143 why do people/trolls like to do this? no one needs your opinion on how faulty your VLC was. am baffled. 
,Gryph_on,2013-04-28T07:15Z,Couldn't even see this hiding behind my VPN. Thanks from Australia. I have episode 5 already. Grateful for this.
,axekitty,2013-04-29T00:00Z,@gryph_on what vpn did you use? I only used a free one like hotspot shield hahaha
,oneleggoalie,2013-06-07T15:09Z,Thank you mam. Did the ep 5 thing...nevermind...all good.
