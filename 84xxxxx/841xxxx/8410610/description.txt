All great characters, sure, but William Shatner will always be best known for one role, and one role alone: RACK. Rural veterinary doctor Robert ΓÇ£RackΓÇ¥ Hansen, of course, he of the inexplicable nickname, fondness for cowboy hats, and habit of hitting on his brotherΓÇÖs widow by saying heΓÇÖd like to ΓÇ£milk her.ΓÇ¥ A lesser man wouldΓÇÖve stopped with Rack, his legacy complete. Such a great, internationally beloved part, itΓÇÖs a testament to ShatnerΓÇÖs skill as an actor that heΓÇÖs escaped its shadow, the Kingdom of the Spiders conventions and catchphrases and reboots, and become known for more than just Rack. RACK. Rack. No seriously, he has people call him Rack and he thinks heΓÇÖs a sexy cowboy. Rack.

Animals and people are dying of spider venom in RackΓÇÖs sleepy Arizona town, and when he and a foxy out-of-towner discover a gigantic hill of venomous spiders on a local farm they somehow donΓÇÖt immediately make the connection, burn it down, and end the movie. What unfolds is a creeping, ridiculous, town-destroying horror, packed with more real live tarantulas than the basement home of that spooky pale guy who sold drugs outside your high school.

Rack up, put on your spider-stompiest shoes, and join Mike, Bill, and Kevin in the Kingdom of the Spiders!
