1x04 -- Apr 25, 2013 -- Ceuf -- PULLED - UNAIRED

Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the 
Boston Marathon bombings. Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com 
(nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/). The webisodes will serve as a bridge 
between Episode 3 and Episode 5. 

The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not yet know when or where.
