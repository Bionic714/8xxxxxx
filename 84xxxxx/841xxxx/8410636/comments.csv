[T],santibone,2013-04-26T15:34Z,"it's cannibalized in six parts, like bryan fuller says (i mean, 6 differents .avi)"
[T],santibone,2013-04-26T15:49Z,and it's only 22 minutes if you make the maths! i prefer to wait until AXN Asia broadcasts the whole episode :)
,hassan43,2013-04-26T17:19Z,Anybody know why this is in 6 parts?
[T],santibone,2013-04-26T22:16Z,"because it's a web-rip, and it was broadcasted in 6 separated parts in NBC website"

Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the 
Boston Marathon bombings. Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com 
(nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/). The webisodes will serve as a bridge 
between Episode 3 and Episode 5. 

The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not yet know when or where.
