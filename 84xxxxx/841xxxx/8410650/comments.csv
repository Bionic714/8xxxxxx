However, I do not agree with the Elmer Gantry style fill out the pledge cards to indicate you're giving yourself to Jesus Christ. I also do not agree with the ""Can you say Amen?"" hypnosis style affirmation statement constantly to reaffirm a previous factual statement.

Bible prophecy is accurate, so much so in fact, that the skeptics claim the prophecies must have been written after the fact and not before... A testimony to their accuracy.

Caveat Emptor!

I will upload the Elmer Gantry movie for those who are unaware of the revivalist style Bible message"
