Lord Solve Our Problems But, Save Our Pigs - Davis Asscherick - Resync

This is a resync of the audio and video. The sync is not perfect but is greatly improved. The video was previously almost unwatchable.

Considering the importance of the message here we thought it was well worth the time spent resyncing the audio to the video
