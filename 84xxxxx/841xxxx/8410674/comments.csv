,famemon78,2013-04-27T11:41Z,"oh man that is some seriously depressing news .. my favorite uploader calling it quits :'( .. no second chances for ur true fans steeler ? perhaps just selective seeding for the existing files atleast ? those who ve patiently crawled their way up to 94 95% in files such as Pina, The Search, Man Who Knew Too Much, The Promised Land? would be most grateful "

,rasspitan,2013-04-28T04:05Z,"Oh no!  Steeler, don't leave!  Here's to one of the best uploaders in a looooooong time.  If I promise to seed for a week, each movie I download, will you start up again?"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-28T17:35Z,To everybody. Thank you for the e-mails and comments about my work. I'm going to be uploading again soon. I have some rules. I will not be doing any requests. It got me to overwhelmed. I'm only going to upload movies that I think people will enjoy. All that I ask of you is to seed as much possible. If you still have me as your favorites. Watch out!
