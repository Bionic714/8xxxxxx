Arts Documentary hosted by Jonathan Ross, published by ITV broadcasted as part of ITV Perspectives series in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Jonathan Ross examines the life and career of the most celebrated director in the history of cinema, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, in a quest for the British roots of his unique style. Jonathan is a huge fan of the Hollywood legend and finds out what led the son of an East End grocer to embark on a career in the film industry. He visits Gainsborough Studios where Hitchcock secured his first job at the age of 20, designing the captions which appeared on screen in the silent era - just five years later he was a director. Jonathan meets actress Jean Marsh, who starred in Hitchcock's penultimate film Frenzy, and hears what the great man was like to work with. On his return to his own childhood home in East London, Jonathan recalls how when he first saw the iconic Hitchcock movie Psycho it scared the life out of him.
