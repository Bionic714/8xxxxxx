so I will cap this for a ratio 
so try to seed max speed while grabbing else it could hang as Im heading to bed now and wont 
be monitoring it

i also have other torrents seeding at same time
that are yet to seed out !

ENJOY and HELP SEED!"
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T02:18Z,"ok has 12 seeders was. 18 but many leaving it

i have to leave you to it also ive shared 1.6 ratio

if your a fan up to you keep it going for other fans"
[V],psspss,2013-04-26T08:34Z,"note those using vuze 4900 will find they wont find many seeders cos its riddle with bugs with UDP trackers

 suggest upgrade to utorrent and never have silly problems

also  everyone is hit and running.. its been downloaded atleast 40 times and 10 seeding it..

come on.. thats not what sharing is about people"
