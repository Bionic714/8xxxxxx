*important message from the author: First of all, my friends, do not take the lyrics of this song seriously. Literally, it's not a positive image. Death to me seemed to be terrifying. Since I know that I was created and assigned by the Lord of the world, I now clearly realize that the earth is only a temporary place to dwell in. The eternal home is in heaven. The most important thing on earth is to prepare myself and form my characteristics for the eternal task in heaven. Friends, hope you will receive this salvation soon before it's too late. I did this song for practicing my arranging skills. 

[Verse 1]
Here I am 
With the sorrow I came
Roses, letters, and tears
Shalom, farewell, my friend

There I saw the winter snow thatΓÇÖs falling from the sky
From mountain high and valley low
Covered in the white

[Channel 1]
White out every story made of memory
Melt into the river flows with out a trace

[Chorus]
Falling, falling.
Falling down as white as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
From the sky, the snow of sorrow falls
Falling down as cold as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
On your face, the face of beauty shows

[Verse 2]
There you lie
With a smile like a child
Eyebrows, lips, and your cheeks
Peaceful, quite, your soul

There I saw the winter snow, thatΓÇÖs melting from the hills
The risen sun, the fallen stars
Taking you away

[Channel 2]
Take you out of here, and out of memory
And the story of ours made it to the end



[Chorus]
Falling, falling.
Falling down as white as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
From the sky, the snow of sorrow falls
Falling down as cold as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
On your face, the face of beauty shows

[Chorus]
Falling down as white as snow 
The snow, the everlasting cold
From the sky, the snow of sorrow falls
Falling down as cold as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
On your face, the face of beauty shows

[Bridge]
Falling snow
Falls on you
River flows
Flows away
Falling snow, oh falling snow
The snow as white as cold as you

[Chorus]
Falling down as white as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
From the sky, the snow of sorrow falls
Falling down as cold as snow
The snow, the everlasting cold
On your face, the face of beauty shows
