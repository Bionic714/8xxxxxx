,Serenifly,2013-04-25T21:21Z,That explains some things. I thought something was fishy with my upload bandwith

[V],promodsharma,2013-04-26T04:00Z,You are right. I was wondering what's wrong with my ISP.
,brianxxx,2013-04-26T19:39Z,"Are you referring to the newest stable version 3.3 build 29544? I had nightmarish problems with all the 3.3 version until build 29544. Everything for me seems to be fine. Luck?

But I also have kept an archive of 3.2.3 build 28705 on my system JUST IN CASE. lol "
,shallow02,2013-04-26T22:37Z,"@brianxxx: Have not checked any new updated V3.3 for a while, but we are still seeing that torrents take longer to seed the more v3.3 users are connected.

Will check this weekend how new 3.3 build is.
