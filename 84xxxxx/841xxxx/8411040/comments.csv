I mean, how else can you explain Your Little Pony?

(Damn sure ain't *MY* little demonic horse-spawn)"
,reneshakil,2013-04-25T19:45Z,"hey mate, i need some help.
for the last two f*****g days, i couldn't upload. every time i try to upload it says 'wrong code'. i tried more than 50 times but results same.
i get all issues before everyone else but couldn't upload due to these problem.
do u have any idea why it's happening to me again and again?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T20:47Z,"ChingaTuu, you just want one for your birthday, don'tcha?

reneshakil, it did that to me yesterday, but only once. i think the captcha thing is messed up. heck, last week, every time i posted, i received an error message. BUT the torrent went live after a few minutes without any further action from me, so it worked out in the end. VERY, VERY frustrating, i know. hang in there my friend. thanks again for your efforts!"
,reneshakil,2013-04-25T21:07Z,"thanks for ur reply.
u r lucky it happens to u only ONE time. but to me it becomes a routine, every week."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-25T21:58Z,"reneshakil, i did some more reading on the subject. perhaps this page can help you with the problems...

,tedsclai,2013-04-26T00:40Z,Would you happen to have Noble Causes #37 and Image United #1-2? I cannot find them seeded anywhere. Trying to fill out Invincible with all of his appearances.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-26T03:13Z,"i don't have any of those right now. i remember image united being hard to get, but i have found old (but working) torrents for it in the past. i'll try, though!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-26T16:29Z,just to update: i've d/l'ed noble causes and image united 1. #2 i'm having trouble with. will torrent them when i get it.
,tedsclai,2013-04-26T16:55Z,I left a comment in your Image torrent. I went ahead and got those comics in print today. Thank you for looking for them. Maybe others might want them. I can torrent Image United #3 if you want.
,tedsclai,2013-04-26T17:01Z,Well I just looked and Image United #3 is on TPB and downloadable. Guess I won't upload it then. Thanks again for taking time to find them. Just went to get some comics from Wednesday and went into back issue bins and grabbed those.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-26T22:02Z,"no problem at all. and hey yeah, if i get the whole set downloaded i'll torrent them just so they're available to people. there was a prelude and #0 as well, so far i've only been able to d/l 2 out of 5 total comics."
,broznik,2013-05-07T01:21Z,"Can I ask why you only have comics 3,5, and 6 uploaded? It seems odd to do those and not the others, or is there a reason behind it?"
,Reno1601,2013-05-30T02:54Z,Any chance we can see 007?
