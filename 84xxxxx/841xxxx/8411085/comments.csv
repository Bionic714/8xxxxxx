,superpaperdude,2013-05-06T09:36Z,"Spend 3 days downloading this.  The installer first locked my computer up three times...then when it DID install, it got to the NVIDIA PhysX installer...which I already have on my system, and it says it can't open the installer.  Incompatible with windows 7 ultimate x64 i guess.  no way around it."
,KlLLA,2013-05-09T16:57Z,"i have downloaded and installed without problems,

W7 x64 here as well and it runs like a charm.  For reference, you can always just use 7zip to unpack the installer.  It isn't really an installer, after all, it's more of a smart unpacker.  The only thing that doesn't get done that way is redists, like PhysX, and if you already have it, you don't need to install it again."

Have you checked the nosTEAM site?  I've had a patch for this game for days now.  It's still a mess, but being a trekkie, I can deal with it."
