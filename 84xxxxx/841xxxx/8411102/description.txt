Wiki recaps:

American Flagg! is an American comic book series created by writer-artist Howard Chaykin, published by First Comics from 1983 to 1989. A science fiction series and political satire, it was set in the U.S., particularly Chicago, Illinois, in the early 2030s. Writers besides Chaykin included Steven Grant, J.M. DeMatteis, and Alan Moore.

Chaykin devised a series set in 2031, a high-tech but spiritually empty, consumerist world in which the American government has relocated to Mars, leaving what remains of the U.S. to be governed by the all-encompassing corporation the Plex. The series star is Reuben Flagg, a former TV star drafted into the Plexus Rangers and posted as a deputy in Chicago, Illinois.

The first volume ran for 50 issues and one Special, of which Chaykin wrote and/or illustrated the bulk of them. A second volume, with Chaykin writing only, ran for 12 issues. Both are included here.

Thank you Mr. Chaykin for such great work and thank you to the scanners for keeping it alive! Get it, seed it!
