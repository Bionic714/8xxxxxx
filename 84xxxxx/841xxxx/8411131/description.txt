
Six friends take the deadliest challenges of their lives when they go into the woods, where a hunter of human lives lurk in the bushes and trees on a mountain top far in the woods of Los Angeles. His playground of death becomes their final resting place as they go through the woods. Many have come in, but few have made it out when they go into the woods.
