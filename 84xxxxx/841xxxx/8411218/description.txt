What's cool about it:
Winner of Best Downloadable Game (GameSpot's E3 Editors' Choice Awards) 2009.
Enchanting visuals, beautiful music, and stunning attention to detail throughout the entire adventure.
Polished and fluid game mechanics make the puzzle solving process a very enjoyable and rewarding experience.
Overview:
Trine is a physics-based action game where three characters combine their powers to devise clever solutions to challenges created by hazardous puzzles and threatening enemies. The gameplay is based on fully interactive physics where each character's different abilities and tactics can be used to invent new ways to overcome obstacles and save the kingdom!

The single-player game is fantastic fun, but Trine is one of those games best played with a friend in co-op mode. Finding solutions in a synergy of different character skills, perfectly timing your actions, and solving puzzles together with your co-op partner is the kind of truly rewarding feeling that only the best co-op games can elicit.

Many indie games get by with a minimalist approach to graphics and audio, making a virtue of limited resources and focusing solely on gameplay. Trine is not one of those games. It has stunning visuals and captivating audio; together, they create an enchanting combination that is almost hypnotically beautiful. Trine is a very unique experience, a slick combination of puzzle and platformer games with brilliantly executed co-operative mode.This is a great choice for anyone looking for a game that is not only fun and eye-candy but also keeps your brain pleasantly occupied.
