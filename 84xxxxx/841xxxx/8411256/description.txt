One of our previous work in the line of Classic Hungarian Comics translated in ENG found a proof-reader, so here comes the revised V2.1 version, ENG text corrected.

Special ThanxXx to phillywilly2470 for his work on proof-reading this title!


The Chinese New Year of the Water-Snake was welcomed with a matching title, the next in the line of Classic Hungarian Comic Books translated to ENG,

The Time Spiral


A science fiction adaptation of a Soviet-Russian author, Martynev, written and drawn by Ernő Zórád. The coloured album was originally released in 1985 in Hungary.

I would like to say a big thanxXx to data9724 and LoonyLuna for their technical advices on how to enhance picture quality.


The next swatura scanlations from Zórád will be an adaptation of Bullwer-Lytton's The Last Days of Pompeii.
