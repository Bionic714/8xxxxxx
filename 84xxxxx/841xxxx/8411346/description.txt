Daffy decides he needs to go on spring break, and drags Porky along when nobody
else will go with him. They quickly end up in jail in a small town in Mexico.
Meanwhile, Lola must impersonate movie jewel thief "The Black Widow" to cover up
losing her mother's diamond necklace. Plus, in the Merrie Melodies video
"Wonderful Bugs", Walter, Lola's father, sings about the joy that is Bugs Bunny.
