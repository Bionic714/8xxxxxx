The Ballad of the Flood

This BW comic was originally released in a strip format only in Hungary under the 1980s, in a weekly periodical, and it is an adaptation of a 1964 science fiction from Zoltán Csernai.

The story is about extraterrestrials visiting ancient Sumeria, so in some ways it can be looked upon as one of the first works pioneering the idea of Ancient Aliens. 

The cover is a result of  joint cooperation between cyraxx, Édua and myself.


This title is the first in the Classic Hungarian Comics serie, which will focus our attention on previously unreleased strips, exclusively in on-line formats only.

The next ENG Attila Fazekas comic scanlation will be Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, and in the Classic Hungarian Comics online serie we will be working on the ENG translation of another BW strip, Imre Sebők's adaptation on Homer's Iliad.
