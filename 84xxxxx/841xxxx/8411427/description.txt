2)  What Lies Below 
"What Lies Below" centers around a young female team of cave explorers that will travel to any location on the planet Earth to passionately explore and document the millions of uncharted miles of caves that rest beneath our feet, much of which has never been seen or tread on by mankind. Each member of our team comes with a specialty that will be used to make scientific discoveries, map uncharted territories, discover new species of animal life, and uncover fantastic wonders never before seen. Our team leader and expert caver is Nancy Aulenbach, who says her first caving experience was in-utero, while still in her mother's womb and has not stopped since. She will lead biologist Dr. Jean Krejca, and geologist Andrea Croskrey MSc, who are all renowned experts in the field of cave exploration. Narrated By Andy Geller
