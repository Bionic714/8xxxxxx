The first issue of Ninth Assassin begins with a sequence highlighting the authority of the new Empire on commerce across the cosmos. During a tense negotiation of terms between business representatives under the supervision of Lord Vader, one of the members fires a blaster shot at a competitor. Vader is too quick for him, using the Force and lightsaber to defend the target, and kill the shooter.

Afterwards, the unnamed father of the unnamed son killed by VaderΓÇÖs hand at the business negotiation forms a security team in search of the best assassin. Going through eight applicants who either ran off with his credits or were killed, the fat businessman uses his resources and a cheaply paid security team to locate his ninth choice. The journey to the Ninth Assassin is like a riddle or a mystery that the reader learns as the encounter unfolds.

The Ninth Assassin is, in essence, meant to be the equivalent of Boba Fett in the assassination business ΓÇô he is impossible to find, has an unknown identity, and allegedly (though evidently) is the best of the trade. He is formidable, skilled, and particularly intelligent ΓÇô and basically a new Star Wars character that has potential to end up in the pages of one of Ben ThompsonΓÇÖs Badass novels.
