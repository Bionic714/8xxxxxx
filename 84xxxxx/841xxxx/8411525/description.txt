What's cool about it:
Sam & Max: The DevilΓÇÖs Playhouse includes the following episodes: The Penal Zone, The Tomb of Sammun-Mak, They Stole MaxΓÇÖs Brain!, Beyond the Alley of the Dolls, and The City That Dares Not Sleep.
Thrill as you control Max who has been made quite powerful with psychic powers beyond mortal comprehension!
Shiver in fear as you visit places such as StinkyΓÇÖs Diner, the early 20th century, and travel into Max himself!
Overview:
An otherworldly power for controlling matter and space calls to the strongest and strangest who might wield it -- intergalactic warlords and eldritch gods, under-dwellers and scholars of the arcane. Gaming's greatest dog and rabbit sleuths Sam & Max seek the power's ancient secrets, as manic Max gains shape shifting, teleportation, mind reading and future vision abilities for battling these foes.

Sam & Max: The DevilΓÇÖs Playhouse is the third season in the acclaimed Sam & Max series and features a bevy of episodes for you to enjoy. In The Penal Zone, Sam & Max are visited by an evil space gorilla who is very keen on MaxΓÇÖs special toy. Discover Sam & MaxΓÇÖs roots as you take control of Sameth and Maximus, Sam & MaxΓÇÖs early 20th century ancestors through a variety of film-reel adventures in The Tomb of Sammun-Mak. A bathroom break goes wrong when Sam finds Max with a serious case of missing brain syndrome in They Stole MaxΓÇÖs Brain! A horde of Sam clones storm the city. Why are there clones of Sam? Why are they three-quarters naked? All these pressing questions are answered in Beyond the Alley of the Dolls. Max changes from our usual loveable hyperkinetic rabbity thing to a 50-ft. tall, city-rampaging, sending-out-floating-and-hypnotizing-heads thing and only Sam can save him in The City That Dared Not Sleep.
