Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site ::  Alex continues his coverage of the Boston false flag event on this Thursday, April 25 edition of the Alex Jones Show. He runs down the CIA connections to the terror bombing and the mounting corporate media lies designed to divert attention and cover-up the truth as the establishment pushes its Muslim terror narrative. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes back trend forecaster, publisher of the Trends Journal, business consultant and author Gerald Celente who weighs in on the Boston false flag.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
