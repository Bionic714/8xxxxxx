,barber-q,2013-04-30T15:16Z,thankyou for this sweet upload I'll have a chance to see if this is as good as zygor real nice of you to upload this for others this is piratebay and that's what we do :-)
,falloutg,2013-04-30T23:26Z,"from what i have seen between dugi's and zygor, dugi's is for the pros and zygor's is far more new player friendly with more info and a much better diffictly curve"
,falloutg,2013-04-30T23:28Z,also dugi's is much cheaper
,krycus21,2013-05-31T22:34Z,Could you update this? It would be awesome!
,barber-q,2013-06-02T03:21Z,we need a newer version that works on escalation round-up 5.3 even zygor doesn't work right on the new patch
