The D1 Grand Prix USA, held August 31, 2003, shattered all attendance records at Irwindale Speedway and firmly established drifting as the hottest new motorsport in North America. Irwindale's previous track attendance record of 8,700 was easily surpassed as a sold-out crowd of approximately 10,000 witnessed their first-ever D1 Grand Prix competition. The D1 Grand Prix debut at Irwindale also eclipsed attendance at previous drifting meets in either the U.S. or Japan.

The August invitational featured 16 of the top professional D1 teams from Japan and 8 American drivers who qualified at the D1 drivers search held earlier this year. The DVD is subtitled in english, and is about 45 mins. long.
