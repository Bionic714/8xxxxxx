Is there any chance of you doing a torrent like this but covers the other publishers (ie. Boom!, Dynamite, Avatar, IDW. etc.)?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-26T04:59Z,nope.  :-)
,tedsclai,2013-04-26T16:26Z,Scratch that request from me for Noble Causes and Image United please. Just got the issues in print instead.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-26T22:00Z,"aww man tedsclai, and i was gonna be all like ""I GOT EM I GOT EM I GOT EM"" lol

truth is, image united #2 is still stuck at 32%  :-)  so i'm glad you picked 'em up in print."
,reneshakil,2013-04-26T22:38Z,"great work on this weekly feed.

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-27T01:57Z,please don't! i found these the easy way. i swiped them from YOU!  ;-)
,tedsclai,2013-04-27T03:32Z,"Here is what I could find of Image United:

If you happen to find Image United Preview that would be awesome. I looked to no avail.

I was wrong about this storyline btw. A friend told me Invincible was involved and he is not as of issue #3. Still Robert Kirkman could write him in when they get around to doing issues #4-6. Thanks again for being awesome!"
