This week we have a highly anticipated (and maybe overhyped) debut, Mark Millar and Frank Quitely's Jupiter's Legacy #1. And there are a couple of old, unfinished projects returning to (hopefully) regular publication in Colleen Doran's A Distant Soil #39 and Whispers #5.

Also included in this pack are 5 more comics. First, the corrected version of Danger Club #5. (With 100% more arm-ripping-off goodness!) And the other 4 are the digital-exclusive G-Man comics by Chris Giarrusso. They've been coming out on Comixology on Tuesdays, and I've passed over them without noticing the Image "I".  **Technically, #1 came out last year, but c'mon, why would I throw in #2-4 and not #1? I'm not that anal-retentive.**

Please seed and share with our friends here on TPB!  --STFmaryville
