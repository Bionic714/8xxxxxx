,til_roque,2013-04-27T01:09Z,"hundreds of seeders and leechers, and nobody bothering to say if it works?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-04-27T03:49Z,"@til_roque
That's the life of an uploader. Generally only the ones who it doesn't work for comment. And those who want to troll you. It's a thankless labor of love for most of it. Then there is that one, or even several, who thank you, and then you know that you love it despite the feedback. I've learned to come to see the amount of seeders to equal the community and love we share more than the comments, for it is by what we share that our true hearts are found. That's why I'm a Pirate Bay uploader.

And then again, it is only the first day that this torrent has been uploaded ;)"
,til_roque,2013-04-27T07:03Z,would be nice if you can add more skyrim mods that aren't on nexus anymore... thanks for the u/l.
,mi2pid,2013-04-28T22:54Z,"Yes works! Thank you very much. 

My experience a little different. Had microsoft copy of pro plus 2013 but had already used 25 digit product code on another device. Tried activator from torrent, entered #'s, and accepted! "
,Paranoire,2013-04-29T22:26Z,"Thanks a lot ! Got a false positive ( or so I hope ) with Kaspersky, but it worked . ( Also browsed a little and it seems like, yeah, it is a false positive )"
,Rafaelsousa20,2013-05-01T16:26Z,"I'm really thankfull for all the work you must have had bringing this new updated software to us, and also think that, even though they don'd comment, hundreds of other persons feel the same as I do"
,mravava,2013-05-01T21:07Z,"it works!
thank you thank you thank you"
,marlonMW3,2013-05-03T02:32Z,"Hey thanks! Really appreciate that you took the time to upload this, you're awesome!!! By the way, after I click on EZ-Activator is there another step or do I just close the Office Toolkit window?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-03T04:54Z,"@marlonMW3
That's it. Close and enjoy your new Office."
,heinsler,2013-05-09T10:35Z,Thanks a lot! Good stuff!
,H4rdR1d3r,2013-05-10T23:23Z,"Hi! Thx a lot for the upload. I'm having some problems with it, after i follow all the steps i open the office and everthing works fine.

But then i shut down the pc, and when i try again office it gives me the message that the office is not activated, there any way to turn this off?

 I had run the toolkit again and the message disapear."
,H4rdR1d3r,2013-05-10T23:39Z,"Hello! thanks a lot for the this torrent, i would like to get some help. 

After i restart the pc,  the office ask to be activated.
I used the toolkit, and it fixes it. But can someone please indicate a permament solution?"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-11T05:01Z,"@H4rdR1d3r
Make sure that AutoKMS is installed. If it fails to install, you might have to add it to your antivirus exclusions list."
,jrndo,2013-05-13T11:51Z,"Thank you very much. Couldn't install Visio, though... Says it can't install when other versions of office are installed. Can anyone help?"
,jrndo,2013-05-13T12:27Z,Done! Visio wasn't installing because I still had a Proofing Tools Preview installed. Uninstalled it and Visio installed without a problem. Nonetheless I found a link that might help someone: http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officeitpro/thread/bdd4fad1-5c85-46c2-ad91-cfaa6d430c7b
,H4rdR1d3r,2013-05-13T21:13Z,"@ WDoubleYouW Thx for the quick answer.

Ok, but how do I know if the AutoKMS is installed?

 I had follow all the steps you indicate.
"
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-13T22:21Z,"In the activation tab there is a AutoKMS uninstaller/installer. If AutoKMS is installed, the button for uninstalling will be clickable. If AutoKMS is not installed, the button to install it will be enabled."
,FNatal,2013-05-14T06:58Z,"I'm seriously pissed about this. No matter what version I install and activator I use fucking Office 2013 will ALWAYS, ALWAYS start to configure after a few minutes or a reboot. I tried EVERYFUCKINGTHING, cleaning the registry, office uninstall tool, using different activators, installing VL, Retail, NOTHING, NOTHING WILL WORK, I tried to add and remove every registry line that any freaking moron talked about before, NO EFFECT. Seriously, FUCK OFFICE 2013, unless some blessed soul can help me out, I see no other choice then sending this damned piece of shit to hell and using Office 2010 or some kind of opensource/freeware option like Openoffice or Libre Office. Seriously, every time this piece of shit starts to configure itself and fucks up the activation. I can use it right off the bat after I activate as fully activated, but after a few minutes, or after the moment I reboot the PC, everything goes down the shitter. If someone, ANYONE has an answer for this, please tell me. I got windows firewall deactivated, only thing is activated is Malwarebyte Anti-Malware. Windows 7 x64 fully activated, everything fine and dandy, except for this motherfucking office 2013, seriously, I wanna shoot someone cause of this."
,Tomixman,2013-05-14T19:28Z,Can you post a torrent for language packs please?
,Booty_Master,2013-05-15T03:18Z,compatible with windows 8?
,H4rdR1d3r,2013-05-15T12:10Z,Ok. thx ;)
,sicuta,2013-05-18T17:18Z,"Can I install this on a legit win 8 pro? I mean, will the activator mess up my legit windows key? "
,WDoubleYouW,2013-05-18T23:45Z,"@sicuta

It should not mess up your genuine Windows 8."
,varunkabra,2013-05-19T14:10Z,"Hey! Thanks for the upload but I am not able to install any application. I am getting ""error 1713: not able to install the software"". I have windows 8. Please help me out. Thanks."
,varunkabra,2013-05-19T14:29Z,"Hey. Thanks for the upload. I am not able to install any app though. I am getting an error called ""error 1713"" on windows 8. Please help me out."
,sicuta,2013-05-19T17:19Z,"Thank you for the torrent, WDoubleYouW. It works fine on my win8."
,Bolt2120,2013-05-25T03:05Z,This is the real deal guys! Thanks to OP. 
,tupaz,2013-05-25T12:20Z,"works fine, thnx"
,haxetros,2013-05-25T22:15Z,"This worked perfectly, now I have Microsoft Office 2013 and I didn't spend $500+

Thanks WDoubleYouW
(Make sure to run the setup as administrator, also be patient, if it takes more then 1-2 hours to install, you have either a really bad computer or something is going wrong, make sure to remove any other versions of microsoft office, also one more thing.

If still not working, stop installing. Go to start in bottom left corner, (Windows 7) 

Go to devices and printers on the right side.

Right Click ""Microsoft XPS Document Writer""
Set as Default.

Then after installing set your HP printer or whatever printer you use.

Hope this helps!"
,Boris.72,2013-05-26T15:02Z,"As everyone else has rightly said, thank you very much. 

This will be completely fine connecting to the cloud, having your settings roam with you, and all that other internet-based stuff that comes with 2013 won't it? No problems with it not being genuine? I occasionally had that problem with 2010 and syncing to the cloud with OneNote with KMS. Thanks again."
,sunsetrider,2013-05-30T15:18Z,Good job OP but why under account setting it says the product is not activated? I used the toolkit to activate
,sunsetrider,2013-05-30T15:26Z,Damn i actually used the windows activator...what should I do now? I actually have the original windows 8 installed but now i have an expiry date. FUCK..any help?
,3pehrthegr8,2013-06-05T19:32Z,"When I run the setup.exe on windows 8 I get the following msg: ""setup can't find or validate the installation file."" I have re-downloaded the torrent a couple of time and the problem still resists!"
,skaring,2013-06-06T13:00Z,Works just fine on Windows 7 x64. THANKS!!
,McWopper,2013-06-08T09:51Z,Thank you very much :)
