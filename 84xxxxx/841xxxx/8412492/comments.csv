,jalucian,2013-04-29T11:59Z,"I assume you're talking about Taking Lives because YIFY didn't do Breakfast Club in 1080p. And yes, I guarantee you'll be happier with the quality of Taking Lives. :)"
,dalesteyn,2013-04-29T18:51Z,"yeah was tlkng about taking lives...
hope to see one day GIA unrated in 1080p...this one is truly unavailable..."
,jalucian,2013-05-04T01:36Z,"Yeah, I've encoded the unrated in 720p but not 1080p. It's ready, just needs to find and upload slot. Been getting lots of requests lately: Malena, Lolita, Nixon, The Motorcycle Diaries, Sling Blade... but we'll get there."
,dalesteyn,2013-05-04T05:53Z,"happy for you....you are getting popular day by day...i think it's time for you to get  a ""TRUSTED skull"".... "
