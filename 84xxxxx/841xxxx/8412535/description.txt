Hi, this is a save for Dark Souls that really gives you some good starting characters that are relatively low level (in the 60's) that aren't really too invested stat wise.  Each character has it's own sort of play-style.
1st char: high hp with a high stamina bar just need to defeat sif and the four kings
2nd char: wizard at firesage with most spells (buy 1 spell n then u can fight logan)
3rd char: Holy guy with most miracles at Anor Lando
4th char: 90 humanity, 200k souls, lvl 28 at bell gargoyles
5th char: Uchigatana build lvl 40
6th char: lvl 1 char at Anor Lando

Procedure to use save:
Go to my documents, 
click nbgi folder, 
click darksouls folder, 
click your live id folder
(If u have a save file, please back it up, this save file will overwrite it)
Copy and paste this save file into that folder
(u could also make a new live id just for this char save! :))

Enjoy the save and characters!

PS this is a legit save file that I did, no kind of editor used!
