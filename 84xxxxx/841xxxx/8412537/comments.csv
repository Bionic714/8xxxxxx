,cchellez,2013-04-26T05:45Z,This is episode 5 of the series and should be relabeled. Episode 4 was titled Ceuf and pulled from US markets due to the sensitive case nature.
,axekitty,2013-04-26T11:16Z,"cchellez is right. but misleading as it is, the uploader prolly couldn't edit it already... download S01E04 Ceuf in 1080p here instead: thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8410604/"
[V],SecTPB,2013-04-26T12:47Z,"I had no idea they were skipping an episode. Just found out after reading comments. Pretty stupid reason to not air something. Guess I'll just label next week's episode to #6. 

This torrent is actually episode #5, because NBC likes to be idiots and not mention anything to us on TV, and the cable company does not change the TV guide info. 

I heard the real episode #4 is only airing in India today, on the 26th. I'm not sure how many people in India would watch this show, and even have capture cards, but hopefully someone caps it."
,axekitty,2013-04-26T14:24Z,completely agree with you SecTPB. NBC pooped on everyone :( 
,cindy25,2013-04-26T14:59Z,cable TV is popular in India and much of Asia
[T],ShoReleases,2013-04-26T17:37Z,Im 100% sure that even though western shows are popular in India there won't be any cap of ep4. 
,cchellez,2013-04-26T18:14Z,"Yeah it was a dumb move considering all of the webseries videos being strung together are all completely out of context. 

I heard mixed reports as to when international markets were getting it. I have a friend in Canada that got it last night instead of episode 5, other sites are reporting international markets are getting it on the 30th. But it's consistent across the board that the US will never see it unless they seek it out online like Fuller suggested."
,dirtydave99,2013-04-26T22:00Z,"@cchellez  In Canada it was episode 5 that aired, it was labelled as episode 4 in the TV listings.

,eightyth_attempt2register,2013-04-30T05:14Z,I've been connected 3 hours.  Thousands and thousands of people connected.  So far not a single one of these horrible sadistic fucks will share the god damn torrent file.  I have never seen it this bad.  Normally they share it right away.
