This is an Original Dell OEM version of Windows 7 operating system for both 32 & 64 bit installations.

This is NOT for Windows 7 Starter or Windows 7 Enterprise editions.

This torrent has been modified by removing the " ei.cfg " file from the Sources folder.
This is the file that is added to a disk & determines what version will be installed from the Windows 7 DVD.

Normally during installation you will not have the option to choose from a list of versions but with this you will be given a list of 8.

During installation,  You just need to let the installer know which edition matches your product key, with any one of the following 8 versions....
Windows 7 Home Basic - 32 or 64 bit
Windows 7 Home Premium - 32 or 64 bit
Windows 7 Professional - 32 or 64 bit
Windows 7 Ultimate - 32 or 64 bit

This Dell.iso upload contains 5.74GB of files which may be needed for any one of the 8 versions.

This is being shared with you as is and with no guarantees.
The Dell.ISO is for producing a DL-DVD or USB, to Diagnose &/or repair your current Dell Windows 7 installation.

I do not take responsibility for the act of counterfeit installations,  but do provide you with the tools that are fully & publicly accessible on the internet in-order for you to use at your own risk &/or your own discretion.
