Skipping school to buy the latest Cure album, Miles arrives at the deserted Media Play parking lot waiting for the store to open. Here he meets Anna, who skipped her own classes for the same agenda. A free spirit, Anna takes it upon herself to bring introverted Miles out of his black-clad shell. A Strange Day is an original graphic novella about alienation, kindred spirits, and two Cure-heads' serendipitous friendship, and the lessons they learn from each other.
