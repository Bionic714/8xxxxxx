'Inferno'
Titan Books, 1996 & 2003 (this version), 145 pages
Written by Mike Carey
Illustrated by Michael Gaydos

When John Travis is murdered he finds himself in Inferno, a Hell with no fiery demons and satanic majesty, just an endless city alive with corruption, intrigue and despair. Yet being dead is the least of Travis' problems; he is actually Jacamo Terence, dead 800 years and the first man to escape Hell and live his life again. This did not sit well with the Infernal Powers and soon, aided by Nostradamus and a were-girl, he is at the centre of a vast power struggle.
