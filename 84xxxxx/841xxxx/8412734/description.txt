Bask De Avregaut is making his way across a lonely desert wilderness in his aerostat (a hot air balloon with sails), when his craft is shot out of the sky and he is taken prisoner by warlord Emir Basileo, the ruler of an incredible, city-sized mobile fortress.
  
Waging a war against a rival lord in an attempt to rescue his abducted bride, the Emir has Bask tossed into the belly of his great fortress, to stoke the fires in it's boiler room. Proving himself as an accomplished cannoneer in battle, however, Bask earns the respect, and even admiration of the Emir and his crew.
