'Beach Safari'
Top Shelf Productions, 2003, 80 pages
Written and Illustrated by Mawil Witzel


A whimsical and beautifully illustrated allegory by German newcomer, Mawil Witzel. Beach Safari is a surreal tale of a male bunny "stranded" on an island with three beautiful young girls. And beneath the graphic novel's charming tale of summer vacations, sunbathing and friendship, runs a stirring examination of self-esteem, loneliness, and the metaphorical concept of being marooned. This sleeper will take you by surprise!
