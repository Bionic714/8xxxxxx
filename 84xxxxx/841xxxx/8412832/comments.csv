Just wondering, didn't Justice League of America # 1 (the new 52) have something like 50 covers or so? 

Thanks for the ul!"
[V],blackcanary,2013-04-26T14:27Z,"Yes, Justice League of America #1 had 52 variant covers (one for each of the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C.).  I believe the record belongs to Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters #1 which had 100 variant covers which were mostly retailer incentives.  Comic book shops that ordered over 500 copies were able to get a personalized variant featuring their store being demolished by Godzilla's foot.  The 100 covers were collected in Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters 100-Cover Charity Spectacular."

i am going to laugh when jla is cancelled or rebooted before #54, and there are more versions of #1 than issues in the entire series!  :-)"
