[V],YIFY,2013-04-26T08:23Z,Runtime: 96min
,fuktastik,2013-04-26T08:44Z,Thanks YIFY. My roomate loves all the girly movies and horror movies. I am loving replacing all these low res. xvid avi files with x264 mp4 files for the better picture on big flat screen. Any chance of 5.1 audio and this current pixel count? I don't know how to or if its possible but that would be greatly appreciated if possible? 
,xidio,2013-04-26T18:47Z,"Yify lying about ratings now too.

Its 72 on imdb. Fucking idiot.
Your quality is terrible either way, how about upping bitrates."
,nox1n,2013-04-27T03:00Z,hey @xidio talking shit about video quality makes you look stupid as fuck considering youve never uploaded a movie and definitely dont know how hard it is to get such good quality into 750mb. and he also didnt lie about shit he got the rating and runtime mixed up and then corrected. fuck you

,primer_,2013-05-13T04:04Z,"Hey. Please buy this movie. If there's any filmmaker who you should support, it's Shane Carruth. He's completely independent. He even distributed the film himself, including its theatrical release (that never happens). He wrote it, directed it, starred in it, and even scored the damn thing. So buy it! It's on every platform and, if you don't like itunes or amazon, you can buy it straight from his website!
