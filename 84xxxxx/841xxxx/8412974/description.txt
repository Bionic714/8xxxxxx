Married... with Children is an American sitcom that aired for 11 seasons that featured a dysfunctional family living in a fictional Chicago, Illinois suburb. The show, notable for being the first prime time television series to air on Fox, ran from April 5, 1987, to June 9, 1997. The series was created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt. The show was known for handling non-standard topics for the time period, which garnered the then-fledgling Fox network a standing among the Big Three television networks. The series' 11-season, 259-episode run makes it the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on the Fox network.
