,aarque,2013-04-26T13:42Z,"Very curious here. I have the darthdeath rip, which is awesome, but a look at the tarmac at Yelizovo and nowhere to be found are the An-12's, Helixes, Hind's and Mi-17's one can see from Google Earth. They even have a Halo:

Meanwhile, I notice somebody at the Avsim.ru site has uploaded a rip of Kamchatka, except he has converted all the objects to FS9 compatability - is that even legal? He reverse engineered payware scenery, then uploaded the result to a commercial site and the mods approved it!

Anyway, I look inside the package and the only thing different from mine is the addition of a Mig-31. If that is their idea of a military sector, a few fighters sitting out, when they should actually be in the hardened bunkers, I may just offer up my own ""update.""

Thanks for the share. "
