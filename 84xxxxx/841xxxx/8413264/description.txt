With its debut album Paraseed has devised a musical statement.
While "catchy tunes" usually are associated with simple-minded pop songs, "ear:worms" presents a deep going and fully packed album of mania, having its origin in inner conflicts with the outer world, combining its paradoxes.
14 one-of-a-kind and individual tracks, that partially can't be more differing, merged to a harmonic album. However, it's just the first chapter that redefines the borders between rock and electronic and crosses them at the same time. When consistently joining opposites the question arises: what comes next?
Like an acoustic parasite creeping through your head it leaves traces that will make you curious in digging deeper until you are trapped and become a "Paraseeder" for yourself.
In that moment you will find out that it correlates with your personality than the things that were usually presented to you.
When you take your time to listen to this album you should gain a new experience of listening that allows you to immerse yourself into another world.
