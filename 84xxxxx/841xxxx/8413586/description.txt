The film is based on the novel by Indri√∞i G. Thorsteinsson, which is set in a remote valley in the north of Iceland in the year 1937. The slump and sheep disease are crippling farming; young people are throwing their hands and streaming to the centers of urban expansion in this period of rapid economic and social change in Iceland.

One farmer and his sons live in the valley alone with their debts and anxieties. The ties which bind the father to the land he has cultivated and lived upon are indissoluble. He has likewise played a leading part in the social organization of the district and in the cooperative movement. Despite unremitting labor, his debts continue steadily to increase. When he dies, his son sees no point in continuing his father's hopeless struggle. He refuses help from the neighbouring farmer and abandons the property and the girl he has been courting. The values which meant everything to the father have lost all significance for the young man, who directs his steps towards the town in search of the values of a new generation, a new age.
