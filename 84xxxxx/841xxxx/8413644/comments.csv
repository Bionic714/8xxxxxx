,ImmaDLStf,2013-04-26T18:05Z,Because mistaking a language that you don't know for other languages that you don't know somehow makes you a freak.
,Killher,2013-04-26T19:08Z,Somebody named florencio15 SHOULD know that it's not spanish. So yes...he's a freak.
,nonimportant_v7,2013-04-26T20:30Z,And trolling someone cause they made a mistake about a language doesn't make you a freak???

,arros,2013-04-26T22:17Z,"why do you all care what language it is in?
it is just a dumb action movie like transformers so it isn't like the dialogue matters."
,nigbroes,2013-04-26T22:57Z,"Actually, It released in India today (26th April) in English, so expect a print getting up real soon, in English (:"
,exarmy28,2013-04-26T23:44Z,Can I ask what the point in uploading this in non-english is?....and you have a green skull shocking!
,Stinnett,2013-04-26T23:49Z,Really need English version bad!!!:/
,Angolmagyar,2013-04-27T00:12Z,"ImmaDLStf, the title clearly states its HUNgarian :)"
,kenbo111,2013-04-27T01:45Z,"@exarmy28, Really? Please don't embarrass the rest of us English speakers by being so self centered. This site is world wide and not everyone in the world speaks English. Please grow up and be more considerate of the rest of the world. "
,Bmack2013,2013-04-27T02:54Z,@kenbo111...In a way your right seems the uploader has specifically written in the info that the movie is in Hungarian language those who cant read seem to have missed that vital part of the info but i think you should be more considerate seems 99.9% of the torrents in the top 100 are in English and coming from America(Hollywood) which is definitely a mostly English speaking place with Spanish been second god knows were Hungarian comes in that line so that means foreign speaking people have to use subtitles for nearly every film in the top100 which are all decent and worth the watch why cause they were made in America mostly that is unless there of a Hindi nature or the upload is uploaded from a different country with a different language not been English obviously then the movie will be in the native speaking language from were the upload has come like this upload for instance which is from hungary easy to gather.That is until there is an English release uploaded or even just english audio line somewhere which could just be synched with this video line such this will be soon seems its released in most countrys this week an English version isn't far away like any new release that comes.Any how thanks for the effort as always uploader(s) any effort is much appreciated great work but will wait for English release which will hopefully be sooner rather then later...Well whats left to sat only keep up that SEEDING people and Long Live TPB the worlds largest bit torrent tracker site in the world which will be at a 10year milestone very soon let the party begin in Stockholm hell yea let the games begin ;) a whole decade who wuda taught it possible in your face Hollywood for hopefully another 10yrs god willing sorry our pirate god willing lol peace pirates :} 
,hatepig,2013-04-27T03:20Z,"Mistaking Hungarian for Spanish makes you a fucking idiot, not necessarily a freak."
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-27T05:45Z,"Actually I fixed the other posters sentence for him:

Arguing about what is *at best* a marginal movie on The Pirate Bay makes you a fucking idiot, not necessarily a freak. "
,clutchkiller,2013-04-27T09:21Z,"Is there any other fellow Hungarian who could actually tell me about the quality? How watchable is this copy? Thanks in advance. Uploader, keep up the good work."
,majikku22,2013-04-27T13:02Z,@clutchkiller  - why don't you download it and find out for yourself!  Geez.  its free...would you like someone to massage your feet and rub your balls as you watch it too?
,papayrus,2013-04-27T15:25Z,"@majikku22
Yes"
,balrog814,2013-04-27T15:41Z,"vlc, letölt 15%, megnéz hang, képminőség."
,mrcheesete0,2013-04-27T17:21Z,"Dat HUN tag in the title.
Dat HUN Name in the desc.
Dat HUN (Mic) language type in the desc. 

Wait who said ghostnet should tell us something? It seems like he told us at minimum of 3 times that this is Hungarian."
,tdurden83,2013-04-27T19:00Z,"+1 

don't give the uploader shit just because you didn't take the time to read the description thoroughly. and mistaking Hungarian for Spanish is pretty damn funny. thx gh0stnet

,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-28T22:48Z,"After listening to the English versions available right now, I think it might be easier to learn Hungarian than to filter, boost and resync the English audio."
