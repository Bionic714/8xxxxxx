Vampire knight. English Dubbed. No Subtitles.

If your searching for the Anime you already know what it is your looking for so I am not going to type out a Description of it. Instead I'll explain to you idiots who constantly complain about Seeding. That if you download the damn files you should seed your damn self for a while. Because you all constantly download then stop seeding your self and it results in the people bringing you the content your looking for to have to constantly seed every single torrent they create so that people can have the content. Making every new torrent take even longer for someone else to download. For every 100 people who download it seems there is only 1 person who seeds so much as a 1 % ratio
