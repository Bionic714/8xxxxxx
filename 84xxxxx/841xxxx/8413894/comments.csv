,mascan42,2013-04-27T21:18Z,"Are we going to have to wait until it airs in the UK some time in June?

Also, fuck these over-sensitive assholes who can't bear the thought of dead kids on a series full of dead adults."
,barms236,2013-04-28T21:03Z,full episode not the web version: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8420634
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-29T05:08Z,"Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the Boston Marathon bombings. 

Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com 
(nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/). 

The webisodes will serve as a bridge 
between Episode 3 and Episode 5. 

The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not yet know when or where.
