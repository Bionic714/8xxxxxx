[V],globeplus,2013-04-27T14:23Z,"To STuNNERr : thank you for your comment and appreciation for my work on this type of files , unfornatly i get my wordpress blog shutted down with close 600.000 clicks in a close 1 year time and they wanted probably that i spent money in stuff of the site not beeing anymore a free user or something , one thing it is for shore it was a long time up and kicking and they didn´t said nothing about it ... then i got problems in my life , a close familiar person died and i needed to change home with some difficulties on the process and was months period with bad internet that i finally resolved over a year later , now i have a internet connection with only acceptable speed because the type of the connection , so really long files can be a tough task but 1,2 or maybe 3 giga maximum files ok but the downloaders needing some time not exagerated anyway and when i see not too much help for this type of files (i am not refering to this one that i hope that at least get a positive balance) my incentive to present this type of work it is almost nothing even if i tought that i can really be a very nice option for this type of game file and i really feel that i can do very acceptable work but recognising that only possible in some games , many of the games have heavy archives with tough edition and high compression ratios and then almost no chance of a positive work but with some luck few of them probably can be worked , in what it is possible i think my work is very correct for this type of file and i don´t hesitate in doing my best shot when it is possible , i confess that i always get a little frustrated when the games don´t give any chance to do any positive work but it is like that ... once again thank you to you and to all of you that can appreciate in anyway this type of file , from me the users can expect nice positive files with all the correct sharing spirit and that it is the feeling that really matters in a nice file sharing community ... happy games to all of you and we see each others here at piratebay ..."

Windows Xp sp3 here. Any solution?"
[V],globeplus,2013-04-27T20:24Z,"To 0101neo0101 : hi there and that probleem on the launching of the executable certainly it is not happening with normality on the game executable , i searched google and find out about 10 well knowed games with the indication of the same problem on the executable launch and the solution it looks to be to download and install or reeinstall the net framework 4.0 that can be downloaded on the next link :

Good luck with that and happy game."

Thank you very very much =)"
,TheC2G,2013-04-28T16:06Z,Played your FIFA 11 and PES 13 rip and its AWSOME..huge thanks for this one globe ;)
[V],globeplus,2013-04-28T16:42Z,"To HeartOfASaint and TheC2G : thank you very much for your comments and certainly it is because of users that can appreciate this type of work that i don´t mind when it is possible to share my tough work on this type of files , the biggest problem still beeing the games with heavy archives with high compression ratios that really don´t let to do to much work because if for one side i want to get the best size possible for other side nothing of this work don´t make sense if all the necessary gameplay to finish the game is not available on the rip file , the essence of the rips and crucial rule is that you can do everything you want unless damage the gameplay in anyway so because of that is needed a general analysis on the files of the games before start the work and then is to spent all the necessary time to get all the essencial gameplay for the less size possible , when this is positive it is a beauty because you feel like saving giga on the hard disc space and nothing important really happen anyway ... that´s my point of view and i suppose the same point of view of the rest of the users of this type of files , at least when well worked they are really a valid alternative option to the original games files ... thank you again and happy games to all of you ."

,0101neo0101,2013-04-29T09:43Z,"Hi Globeplus.
But 3DM crack v1 launches the game without problems, but there is no save game progress. 3DM crack v2 and Reloaded crack are the ones giving me ""0xc0000142"" launch error.
¿?¿?¿?"
,STuNNERr,2013-04-29T10:37Z,"@0101neo:-
U Probably use avg antivirus,just stop the shields,better still unistall avg,and u will be fine to go"
,0101neo0101,2013-04-29T10:54Z,"I use Avast. 
I updated the net framework 4.0, but nothing solved (anyway, with the 3dm_v1 crack the game launches, but no saved games, so this might not be).
I turned off the shields on avast, but nothing."
,0101neo0101,2013-04-29T11:16Z,"I use avast.
Updated to net framework 4.0 but nothing solved (problably not the problem because with 3DM crack_v1 the game launches).
Turned off the avast, but same problems."
,0101neo0101,2013-04-29T20:13Z,"Save games issue solved with Skidrow crack!!!
You have to restart the game (ship tutorial again) and reach to Chapter 1.
I'm happy now."
