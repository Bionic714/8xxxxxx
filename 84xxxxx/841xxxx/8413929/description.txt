* Plot :

Riptide takes place immediately after the ending of Dead Island, with the four immune survivors - ex-American football player Logan Carter, rapper Sam B, Hong Kong police officer Xian Mei, and Australian bodyguard Purna - landing on an aircraft carrier after escaping from the prison island. They are immediately taken into custody by the ADF Colonel Sam Hardy and Frank Serpo, a civilian VIP. In the ship's brig, they meet another immune survivor, soldier John Morgan, who claims Serpo stopped the military's evacuation. The player can find excerpts of Morgan's diary throughout the game, showing the military eventually decided to simply firebomb the entire stricken area.

Passing out from sedatives applied when they were examined, the player's character wakes up to find the ship overrun with zombies. Serpo flees via helicopter shortly before the ship, out of control, crashes into a rock. They regain consciousness again on the shore of the island of Palanai and are found by Harlow, a WHO researcher, who tells them the zombie infection has spread there as well. After saving a holdout of survivors they meet Colonel Hardy again; he tells the irate immune that Serpo's organization is interested in weaponizing the Kuru strain that caused the zombie outbreak and, as with Banoi, a nuclear strike against Palanai is planned to purge the infection and cover up the evidence.
