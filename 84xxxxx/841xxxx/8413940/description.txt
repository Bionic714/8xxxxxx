Raw music rips (.scd) from KH 1.5, courtesy of GuardianSoul from FFshrine (http://forums.ffshrine.org/f70/kingdom-hearts-hd-1-5-remix-gamerip-129137/4.html#post2333890). Can be opened, played and edited in Audacity. Some songs from the KH1 OST (Hikari, credits music, etc.) are missing, presumably because they're tied into the pre-rendered FMVs and so cannot be extracted, as such. Don't think those were changed either way though.

Note that I said RAW, so they're unlooped, and you'll probably find split songs, duplicates, etc.; I'm leaving the adjusting and clean-up for someone else, since I don't have the time or patience. I just nametagged the songs so you could find them easily. Feel free to upload an improved version if you can fix everything.

I cannot for the life of me figure out where the last four tracks in the KH1 section are from but I'm assuming they're fragments from the songs listed above.
