,Zurree,2013-04-26T16:27Z,Haha 100kb? Yeah right
,RoBoUK,2013-04-26T18:38Z,"@Zurree, why don't you actually try it? The .exe is only 216KB"
,Zurree,2013-04-26T19:18Z,"Yeah i did, 

Error: Steam is required to run this game.

No harm done anyways ran this in ny virtual box.

Nice try tho"
,RoBoUK,2013-04-26T20:15Z,"@Zurree, that is how the crack works. when you run the .exe it launches with steam and says you are playing a different game, on the first Dead Island it was America's Army 3 and now it is Serious Sam 2 HD.

Just make a free steam account and use that to play online or use Tungle and the crack works. "
,simuno,2013-04-27T16:05Z,Can they ban me from steam using this crack ?
,snowstone,2013-04-29T04:37Z,for a supposed online fix sure not a lot of seeders
