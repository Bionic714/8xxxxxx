,el_barto7,2013-05-05T08:31Z,"Enroute NOT Working, tested on JeppFD 2.0.0 in different iPad´s. (Termcharts OK)

Also tried on JeppFD 2.0.6 NOT working either. "
,cya320,2013-05-07T21:56Z,"Was checking JeppFD 2.06 with 1309 data on an ipad2 non-jb using ifunbox or diskaid
all data loaded into jeppfd.app-demodata-enroute folder and sub folders.
copy from 1309 db_b, db1 & store folder to ipad enroute-database folder. db_b folder has the lastest data. I think db_a has the older data. I confirmed with checking sometime updates.
enroute data works
copy terrain folder from jeppfd 2.0 to jeppfd 2.06 otherwise terrain limited to one map.
terrain works. however the distinction of sea and land is not shown when zoom in
termcharts works. no issue. copy the 1309 termcharts folder to demodata-termcharts.
weather also works with terminal & enroute
suggest to those still with fd2.0 to copy out all folders & data to pc for the time being. you don't know if you need them later.
will have to wait & see what file structure for the next update."
