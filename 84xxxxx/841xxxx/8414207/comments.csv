[V],psspss,2013-04-27T02:40Z,"its funny though.. you say downloading 6gig is alot

when most download HD stuff at 1.4gb an episode!
or only like 4 episodes of something

this is 14 episodes or shows.

and really if you dont watch them all how can one be informed on the subject properly
you miss out on a hidden gem in one of the
episodes


you cant be a real ufologist or fan if only watch 10 percent of my shares.. as I out together all the best stuff out there even if the subjects are a little whacky and some of the people

it wasnt until I watcched all the stuff on flatwoods monster I didnt know it was really 6 ufo sightings and landings as people didnt all see the same craft as they landed in different places

and I thought it was a creaute with arms when in fact it was really a space suit made of metal and 2 holes in it like port holes and arms were antennas
the cloak and red eyes were done by a tv artist and it stuck"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T02:45Z,bum typos but you work out what I mean.. creature for one :) put not out :/
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T02:49Z,"remember it also takes me many hours to convert this stuff and check it and rename it.. sometimes people rename stuff and put wrong dates so not sure if its new stuff or recycled.


I also have to download it (once I stumble across it and work how how to rip it.. some need speical soft to crack it)

I also have to use double the bandwidth.. I have to download the 6gig .. fix it rename it and re share it on p2p.. another 7-8gb as you get leechers so you wonder why I bitch at the TAKERS"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T03:22Z,"

I only have 150gb each month too. 70gb gone in 6 days.. and half that was from me sharing stuff"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T03:27Z,"

also make sure DOWNLOAD TO ROOT folder or nfts root partition as some people seem to download in a long folder names like c:/my downloads and then find they cant move them or play them.. as p2p soft allows to create longnames and many folders exceeding the windoze explorer .. a typical MS bug thats existed in all windows since longnames were made!
if stuck use my windows longname renamer tool it used MS dos trick to rename longfiles stuck in sub folders"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T04:57Z,"

Also People I see some using VUZE 4900

dump it.. it has so many problems wit udp trackers
I doubt youre seeing all the seeders and peers!
its crap software they dont even answer the forums.. I tried the software to compare it to utorrent and even with all the plugins its not up to utorrent standards.. utorrent has all that built in.. udp, country translation etc

give utorrent 3.3 a try.. and see if you see more seeders and peers..

else you are really handicapping yourself "
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T10:16Z,"as per c2cam the lady ghost is on home page at

http://joshuapwarren.com/"

[V],psspss,2013-04-27T11:36Z,"linda is ok to listen too until shes starts about goddy stuff.. prob alien beaming thoughts in to the head

as for the mystery booms still says its a up and coming quake event... usa is over due"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T12:34Z,"hallow earth one is kinda funny too.. the guy even believe billy meyer ufos are real when even the wife said one was definitely a rubbish bin lid

if earth was hollow with a black hole at pole then i say someone would of walked across poles and found no big holes.

although maybe theres some form of underground caverns and maybe ufos enter volcanoes to get to some of the larger ones.. who knows.. maybe a little truth in it "
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T13:19Z,"

OK 14 of you got 100 percent.. and 3-4 dropped off..

I too have to drop off.. as shared 8gb of it.. is more then i can afford of a 5gb file.

else I wont have enough for next weeks UFO bundles"
,nnic028,2013-04-27T15:12Z,Thanks a lot psspss for this bundle
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T15:51Z,"
just listened to c2cam on black eye kids and adults

then I thought maybe not so weird.. they got contacts to try to freak people or in a cult thinking they are cool.. or kids pranking people LOL

google black eyed contacts and you can see a tube of a guy showing them"
[V],psspss,2013-04-27T15:52Z,sometimes the obvious answer is never asked on these chat shows. but I see also really its the same guy pushing his book with the stories.. why not normal people or videos of people talking about it? makes you wonder..
[V],psspss,2013-04-28T16:05Z,incident at kelly is a good one.. was remade in the series monsters and mysteries episode 2 ?
,applesack,2013-04-28T19:05Z,MY apologies psspss i didn't mean to be rude in any case the 10% may have been  a little low on my part i don't like the radio show guy he is a little out there for me and they take up some space on the download..I like the video footage and the ufo web shows very much and i appreciate all the gold mining shows u put i cant get enough of those thanks again from Canada Cheers...
[V],psspss,2013-04-29T03:54Z,"if you mean coast to coast he interviews some creditable people I think he is a little religious
which sways his thinking.. and I think he tries to be neutral and if callers are out there too much or plan weird he ends the call

you really should listen to the greer interview and flatwoods interview he did"
[V],psspss,2013-04-29T03:59Z,"also I like the news clips added to them.. some interesting stuff they talk about like korea.. as media news is so bias this radio show gives another point of view and seems again the radio expert analysis he called had it right

however this is the last of the big torrent certainly until the next monthly cap reset
as running low again. i will try to keep them under 2gb if possible but some days I find some good ufo docus (not rubbish ones or crackpots) I dont have in my 600gb collection which is growing still. I thought it run out of material but theres always new stuff.. next will be more movies and docus being made and of course Disclosure 2013 news event which I suspect my blow that 2gb limit HMMM"
