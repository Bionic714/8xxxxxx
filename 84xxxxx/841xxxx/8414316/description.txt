the accent is sometimes hard to understand, especially for somebody who doesn't speak english as its mother tongue.

i would be very thankful to somebody who could write down what the people say in this film. It would allow to do english subtitles and subtitles in any other languages afterwards.

It would be great to make the les blank films more watchable to people from the whole world. Even Though sometimes films are already good even if you don't understand everything they say.
