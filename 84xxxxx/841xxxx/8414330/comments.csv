,kodomo_scales,2013-04-26T18:09Z,****! forgot to title this properly.  this is episode 01 only
,cpt.shinyside,2013-04-27T02:14Z,"Thanks again kodomo. Will seed as always. I have a request for you, would you be able to do a HD dub of Infinite Stratos? There is only one up here, but it's pretty terrible. Cheers."
,kodomo_scales,2013-04-27T04:36Z,Since its not that long of a series and youre probably my first and only commenter/downloader. i will fufill your request. lols
,Lost_Leaf,2013-04-27T06:17Z,"Wow! What a treat. 

Thank you so much, Kodomo. I'm guessing you got these from Neon Alley? As I've been looking for this all over since I'm not from the US. 

The only request I could make, if it's alright with you, is if you're able to make smaller file sizes? If not, that's fine. 1.65 GBs is just a lot for one episode is all. And please keep uploading the dub of Fate/Zero as it airs :)

Seriously, thank you so much! "
,kodomo_scales,2013-04-27T09:42Z,"Lostleaf, about 2-300mb i beleive is from the flac japanese audio. along with the 60mb english aac .. hmmmm. im an encoder for deadfish on the side so  for size, the best im willing to do is release single audio or hardsub aac mp4s at the same time possibly at the same time as dual audio mkvs if you may be interested. "
,kodomo_scales,2013-04-27T10:05Z," Dual audio bluray of infinite stratos should be up in just hours. . im going to be taking more requests for a while,  as long as i have help seeding, i wont mind adding more. depending on how i feel about the show i guess. but i can get em done fairly fast. "
,Lost_Leaf,2013-04-27T13:51Z,"If it's too much trouble then don't worry about it, man. I'll take and seed whatever I can get from you when it comes to the Fate/Zero dub. 

I just usually manage to find most of my anime in 720p at around 500 MB per episode. But as I said, I really don't mind taking this if that's all you have. Thanks again! "
,kodomo_scales,2013-04-27T20:27Z,"i will do most things in 720, so closer to that size.  infinite stratos delivered"
,Lost_Leaf,2013-04-28T09:50Z,"Thanks. I really appreciate it. 

Do you have any idea when the next episode of Fate/Zero with the English dub track will be available? "
,SovietNinjaz,2013-04-29T06:24Z,Thanks so much for this! Will you be uploading the new episodes as well? 
,kodomo_scales,2013-04-29T21:49Z,"yep, i will be doing them as soon as i grab the audio.  for now im working on a couple of the best shows this season, unless i get a request im interested in. hint hint. lol"
,Lost_Leaf,2013-04-30T02:15Z,"Hmm. Well, the only other series that I've personally been after that hasn't been uploaded by any group in dual-audio, would be Naoki Urasawa's Monster. But it's 74 episodes.. For fans of Death Note, it's a great murder mystery. 

But mainly I'm excited for Fate/Zero, since you're the only one who provides high-quality dual-audio of it. "
,kodomo_scales,2013-04-30T12:39Z,"I have everything i need for monster though the resolution is limited to just dvd. i will most likely be releasing them in 5-10 episode batches, ive been planning to for a while but i just never got around to it.  working on it now"
