All Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

Monster Summer Hits: Drag City collects 26 hot-rod and car songs from the early '60s, including classics from the Beach Boys and Jan & Dean, as well as obscurities from the likes of Jerry Cole & the Spacemen. Drag City has more rarities and unusual items than its companion disc, Wild Surf, which means its appeal is limited -- although there are some fun tracks on the disc, it has too much filler to make it consistently enjoyable.
