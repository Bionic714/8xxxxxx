All Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

Monster Summer Hits: Wild Surf contains 26 surf rock hits from the early '60s, mixing classics by the Beach Boys, Jan & Dean, and the Ventures with obscurities by the Fantastic Baggies, the Honeys, and the Sunrays, among others. All of the songs come from Capitol's vaults, which means that there isn't much variety and that it isn't a definitive overview, but it's an entertaining listen, nevetheless.
