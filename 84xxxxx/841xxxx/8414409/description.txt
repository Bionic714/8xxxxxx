Files are named via TheTVDB.com for my XBMC if you don't like it rename them.

My upload speed is slow so give it some time, be patient, and SEED!

Be sure to not limit your upload speed so I don't have to seed much more than 100% to get the torrent self sustaining. It would help me and you out a lot.

As for [Fixed Color] for those that don't know the current 1080p encodes out right now have an encoding error that made the color washed out. That is not a problem with this version.
