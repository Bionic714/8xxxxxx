BUS DRIVER

Bus Driver is a unique driving game for Windows and Mac by SCS Software. You may download and try this game on Windows for free, before you decide to buy it.


Bus Driver is all about driving buses.

In Bus Driver, your job is to transport passengers around an attractive and realistic city. You must drive to a timetable on a planned route, whilst obeying traffic rules, and taking care not to upset or injure your passengers. This makes Bus Driver unlike any other driving game - the experience of driving a bus is very different from blazing through a racing circuit as in most driving games.

12 different models of bus to drive, such as double-decker and schoolbus.
30 routes with varying weather conditions set at differing times of day.
An expansive city environment with various districts.
