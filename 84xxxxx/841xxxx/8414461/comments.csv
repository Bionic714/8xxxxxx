Also: Please bring back demos, people!

Thanks for the quick up, Stiffy. Har har."
,DuckManX,2013-04-26T19:38Z,"Crashes after launch, any idea on how to fix it?"
,filipmolnar,2013-04-26T23:17Z,"@DuckManX

Did you follow the steps?:
I. Unrar release, mount .cue, install the game
II. Copy contents of Crack Directory to install dir

You can't expect help without giving any information."
,mishrefii,2013-04-27T00:14Z,"Hello I have a problem ""0x10287ae at 0x00000034"" and can't start the game. Any idea how to solve it?"
,mishrefii,2013-04-27T00:15Z,"Forgot the 5 after the ""...ae"". Sorry!"
,dp098765,2013-04-27T01:21Z,"@DuckManX - The issue is with the shortcut that is created...it has an incorrect starting location listed and if you right click the shortcut and go to properties you can just remove the ""bin"" part from the starting location line.  That is what fixed it for me."
,dp098765,2013-04-27T04:16Z,on a side note...this game should not even be released yet because the controls feel like they are still in an alpha state...needs a lot of work and many updates before this is playable imho.
,tomkra,2013-04-27T06:49Z,"thanks dp098765, removing the ""bin"" from the start dir fixed it for me"
,rxanp,2013-04-27T10:28Z,"wow, thanks Stiff... I was wondering if there's a Kinetic Void release out there that you could upload...
I really wanna try it out..."
,moeburn1,2013-04-28T00:58Z,anyone play this game yet?  is it any good?
,dp098765,2013-04-28T04:29Z,yes I played it...the game fucking sucks.
,kevodanh,2013-04-28T05:34Z,"Torrent works.
Game has a questionable quality though. Meh voice acting , BAD BAD cutscenes. Gameplay has some bugs , not really fluid , but passable.
Overall meh."
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-04-28T19:19Z,this game sucks big time. 
,SenorSkur,2013-04-28T21:07Z,Getting a glitch where side quest NPCs are floating in the air anyone else getting this or have a fix?
,soyuz16,2013-04-29T03:59Z,"this is the same as heromasters right? anyway, game is great but there is a problem, the game crashes to a point that my monitor says, ""No Signal"" and i have to restart my pc for that, any fix for that? thanks."
,Wagzy69,2013-04-29T05:29Z,"Works great. Used Daemon tools lite to install, copied crack over.

To everyone that doesnt know this is a ""BUDGET game"" Meaning it may have it's flaws but it's only worth $20. Expect a few gltiches and bug."
,Taliyuna,2013-04-30T13:04Z,"Great game! 
THx Stifler!"
,nawnwa,2013-04-30T21:28Z,"cnt understand the hate fr this, not the best one ,, but still i played it fr hours,, although voice acting is bad !!"
,dp098765,2013-05-01T03:16Z,"There is no need to create a new shortcut if the game closes after launching.  Simply right click the shortcut to get to the properties menu and on the line for the ""Starting Location"" simply remove ""bin"" from the end...done...and try to enjoy this mess of a game."
,deimos170,2013-05-02T04:21Z,just 2.54GB? how can this be? is this game really short or something? it's weird to see a new generation videogame that's less than 5GB
