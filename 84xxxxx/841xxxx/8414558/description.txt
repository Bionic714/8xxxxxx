5 friends convene for a weekend at the house where they spent a great deal of their childhood. Each comes from a different background. Ted and Bev are recently engaged. Alex is single. Rachel is recently single. And no one knows what has happened to Jonah, the one who now owns the house and has masterminded this whole reunion. He had been absent throughout their adolescent years and suddenly now wants to get everyone together again. The reunion rekindles some old relationships, puts doubts in current ones, and reveals secrets long thought to be water under the bridge.
