"Japanese composer/percussionist whose bizarre ideas and musical eclecticism have made him well respected in varied musical circles but keep him a mystery to the general public. Yamashta's musical productions combine elements of jazz, rock, classical and electronic music deftly, and sometimes arbitrarely - hence his difficulty in reaching a mass audience. 'Man from the East', a strange but fascinating stageshow featuring elements of Japanese Kabuki theatre, spawned the 'Red Buddha' album, which is the best demonstration of Yamashita's astounding technique as a percussionist." ***
