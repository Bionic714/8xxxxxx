,scarecrowninja,2013-04-27T17:15Z,"Sry...my mistake...you have to use cracked exe from the directory, not the shortcut."

That sounds more like your graphics card/CPU overheating and forcing your system to shut down to prevent it from damaging itself.  Get Speccy and try running it to see how hot things get."
