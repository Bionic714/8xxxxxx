2013 acoustic release from Canadian singer/songwriter Valerie Anne Poxleitner AKA Lights. The album fines Liights reinterpreting songs from the hit album Siberia. When Canadian electro-rock sensation Lights first hit the music scene in 2008, she was just a songwriter with a synth and a dream. Her name may have been pluralized but Lights Poxleitner was a one-woman show who played and programmed her own instruments.
