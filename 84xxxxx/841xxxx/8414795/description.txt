What's cool about it:
Protect the Enclave in the name of Light or join forces with the Dark
Twelve unlockable playable characters that you can equip with an abundance of weapons and armor
Dynamic third-person action-adventure gameplay
Overview:
In the fantasy world of Enclave the people of Light and Darkness are divided by a bottomless rift that split the earth many millennia ago. The lands of Light are prosperous and rich, an Enclave of truth and order, surrounded by the twisted and barren lands of the dark, war-ravaged plains known as the Outlands. 

Over the centuries the rift has started to close, skirmishes along the border have become more and more frequent and it is only a matter of time before these altercations turn into a full scale war. 

Here, it is up to you to choose. Will you lead the desperate people of Celenheim and save them from destruction, or will you ally with the dark hordes of the Outlands and overrun the Enclave to get back what you claim to be yours? Make your decision and experience incredibly atmospheric and intense medieval combat action!
