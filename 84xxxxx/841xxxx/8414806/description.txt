What's cool about it:
Revolutionary game packed with tons of dark humor, an impressive variety of hellish creatures, and highly addictive gameplay
Build your dungeon, protect it with a labyrinth of dark corridors, a web of deadly traps, an arsenal of powerful spells, and an army of bloodthirsty demons
A refreshing title for someone tired of rescuing princesses, saving worlds, and all that love, happiness and political correctness junk. Just this once, be the bad guy!
Overview:
Being the Dungeon Keeper and all, this is your home, too. And itΓÇÖs your business to take these loathsome creatures of darkness and hone them into screaming, frothing, clawing forces of destruction. You lure them in with food and the promise of dank and fetid places to sleep. You keep them in line with the back of your hand and the threat of dire consequences. You pit their scaly hides against the best that the Forces of Good can muster, and they die for you as they rip steaming entrails out of the hapless heroes.

ItΓÇÖs a degenerate and nasty jobΓÇª And you love it. Yes, home its where you heart is. In a box. Packed in salt. That's right--Dungeon Keeper, Bullfrog's classic dungeon management strategy, gives you no extra credit for having any morals. After all, the underworld isn't black and white!
