,Furious1964,2013-04-28T19:23Z,"I'm in a one-on-one game with Claptrap and he seems to have frozen. I called, he raised, cards were dealt and when I raised....he just said ""Really?"" and is taking a damn long time to make a bet. Did he freeze? Did the game? Shoulkd I hit him with a hammer and see what happens? j/k....but not about him not doing anything.  Anyone know what's happening?"
,Sivos,2013-04-29T19:40Z,"They really need to release a bug fix patch for this game.  There has been many times I and the other players were suppose to win and we don't.  Such as, I was playing Omaha hold'em and in my hand I had four diamonds and one diamond on the flop.  In the end, I was labeled as having a pair of threes and lost.  There was another where I had a royal flush, but was labeled with an ace high and lost.  That even happened to Ash, he had a royal flush and was labeled an ace high.  But the bug seems to happen mostly with straights and flushes, where you have one but are labeled with something lower."
,narlici,2013-04-30T12:52Z,"@Sivos

Dude that's how Omaha hold'em works. You use two cards from what's in your hand and three cards from the table to make five. That's the only combination allowed."
,Alrik88,2013-05-03T06:32Z,"when I try to copy the crack, steam.api.dll will not copy. It says invalid ms dos function.

,i.m.cool,2013-05-04T11:51Z,"but after extracting i couldn't get iso...... 
help..????
only a .bin file & .cue file appears...
so how can i install....????"
,Alrik88,2013-05-05T09:10Z,"anyway, crack in the torrent won't copy but I got it working by downloading (presumably) the same crack from GCW.

As far as the game itself goes, meh, it's fun but once you hear everything it gets a bit stale, and the poker itself is a little iffy, I was just playing and I clearly had a flush(four spades and two in the pile)  yet at the end of the hand it said I had an ace high and I lost everything. "
,daskdaso,2013-05-08T17:08Z,"I click on the .exe but the game will not start, can anyone help?"
,Starwing1126,2013-05-09T21:36Z,Is there any way to connect the items I win to my actual steam account?
