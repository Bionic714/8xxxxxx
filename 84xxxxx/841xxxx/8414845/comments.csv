I'm just curious, about the FCUP.  A certain website comics catalogue lists that there are about 90 First Comics titles.  Discounting those that are trade paperbacks, and reprints, I'm guessing that some will be grouped together as a single torrent. 

How many First Comics torrents do you expect to ul?  I'm betting on 45-50, if you're hitting the entire collection.  :-)"
,Ichthypod_Crane,2013-04-27T02:36Z,"Well, Wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_First_Comics_publications) lists about 40 series, a few more if you include individual minis for the same character, which I'll be grouping together. Some of the bigger names (Nexus, Badger) seem to be well-represented here, so no need for me to upload those. Additionally, I'm NOT a manga fan, so you won't see any of those from me on the First uploads or the upcoming Eclipse uploads. A lot of good-times '80s, worthwhile, comic book fun to come though!"
,Mothra67,2013-04-27T07:07Z,Great stuff as always!  BTW: do you have any of Neal adams Continuity comics stuff?
,Ichthypod_Crane,2013-05-01T01:25Z,"Sorry Mothra67, hadn't even heard of Continuity until I read your post! I'll keep my eyes open and if a source becomes available I'll nab it or make you aware of it."
