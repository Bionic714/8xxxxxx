,EbilPhish,2013-04-27T03:25Z,"Tring to find out if this is any good by every single review on metacritic is from the same date (26th) and most of them are 9+'s, looks like Ice Berg are spamming for scores..."
,thorkis420,2013-04-27T05:47Z,"First off, while the hell would you par file a iso? just retarded. Second, in doing so you corrupted the file. This version does not work."
,Traumec4s,2013-04-27T06:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, works fine."
,axe64,2013-04-27T07:59Z,when i installed this i get a black screen with a cursor on start up anyway to fix this ?
,OmniNegro,2013-04-27T08:05Z,"@thorkis420
Are you sure you are posting that comment on the right torrent? There are no pars here.

Also pars exist for a reason. Mostly so you can be sure to get the correct file regardless of where you got it.

Tell me what program you used for parity and on what file in this archive you used it and I can likely tell you what went wrong. Seeing no parity files I really think you are on the wrong torrent. Good luck figuring it out anyway."
,meskiman,2013-04-27T08:45Z,Why does it say 1.05b beta when i start it?
,meskiman,2013-04-27T08:47Z,Nevermind above comment.
,ItsRainbowDash,2013-04-27T10:57Z,"Upon attempting to ""apply changes"" in the options, it appears to do nothing and return your settings. Also, if changing settings, then attempting to exit the options, such as hitting the big X in the top right will crash the game with an error at future start ups, requiring a reinstall to fix."
,k4m1k4z3_pt,2013-04-27T12:42Z,"@axe64
update XNA,. Net 3.5 and Visual C++ 2010."
,MadRevolver,2013-04-27T12:55Z,@RValdr: This version is 1.07B
,WildGaren,2013-04-27T15:43Z,"The game launchers and plays without the 'crack'... what is it for, then? The beta was without DRM, as well."
,axe64,2013-04-27T23:49Z,reinstalled game multiple times  i restarted pc  still get black screen im gonna redownload the the game i played the beta version without black screen also reinstalled net ans xna
,Kona_Guy,2013-04-28T23:21Z,Thank you!
,sudieken,2013-04-29T06:25Z,"This game is why I torrent shit. I'm a sucker for 4X games but this feels unfinished. It's buggy as fuck and simply lacks polish.

So for the hundredth time, thank you Stifmeister. Glad I didn't get suckered out of $30."
,OmniNegro,2013-04-29T08:40Z,"4X is a hard genre to get right. Too many games are obvious clones of other 4X games and because of that they never seem to bother to finish them.

I am still hopeful that this one will fix all the numerous bugs and make it good. But even if they do, it will still be inferior to Master of Orion."
,Ozom2,2013-05-01T08:11Z,Hey Stiffler message from shitbreak here .. he asks how your mom is? XD
,Unfawkable,2013-05-14T05:07Z,"Even though unpolished and unfinished, this game is awesome. Really hoping you can keep torrenting it's updates, the latest one is 1.09 I think."
,Redwind85,2013-05-16T12:20Z,"Awesome game - definently gonna buy it when enough cash.

until then could you find le update of it ?.

its at 1.10"
,Unfawkable,2013-05-18T20:09Z,"I wouldn't recommend buying yet, it's still in beta even though it's out for purchase like a complete game. They have been somewhat irresponsible about publishing."
,gfd447,2013-05-18T21:39Z,every time i launch the game i get stardrive has stopped working plz help
,Unfawkable,2013-05-22T23:35Z,"It's not an upload problem, it's the game problem, it bugs up a lot. I get that screen sometimes too. Go to the game forums and try finding a solution there."
,MrTTAO,2013-05-23T18:16Z,"V1.07B

There have been 5 patches released since this version and the game is still pretty buggy."
