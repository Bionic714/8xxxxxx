What's cool about it:
Cartoon graphics, intuitive gameplay, and cheerful music create a very relaxing and enjoyable experience.
24 levels in 6 different worlds provide many hours of classic arcade action.
Very easy to get into but if you are looking for a challenge then you can up the difficulty level.
Overview:
An evil old witch has turned the Prince of Magic Kingdom into a bright green frog and kidnapped the love of his life. All hope seems lost for the once regal amphibian. But suddenly, out of nowhere, a strange bottle floats down the stream and catches his attention. Intrigued, our soon-to-be-hero takes a huge swig and after a few minor explosions he becomes the legend that is soon to be known as Superfrog! With boundless courage and new heights of determination, he sets off towards the Magic Forest with three objectives in mind. One, to get back his girl, two, to vanquish the curse, and three, give that nasty old witch just what she deserves! 

Superfrog is a classic 2D platform game with colorful and cheerful graphics and fast-paced action. It's fun, easy to get into, and intuitive. Masterfully designed levels ensure a very smooth and enjoyable experience. It's the perfect title to just sit back, relax, and have a good time.

Note: : This is the DOS version of the game, but our QA team has confirmed that you can indeed finish it.
