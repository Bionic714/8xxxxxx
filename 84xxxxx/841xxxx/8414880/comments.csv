does anyone know why tpb torrents have been slow the past few months? maybe its cuz im in the us, but it never used to be like this regardless of seed count... my up and down speeds are usually excellent... and with EVERY other torrent from any other site, they are. i even tried to dl some tv shows here in high popularity to see if the seed count was the problem... nope... all tpb torrents have tip toed the past few months. anyone else with this same problem?
