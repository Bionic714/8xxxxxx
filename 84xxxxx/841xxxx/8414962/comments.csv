so why do we need to download it from you then "
,Zurree,2013-04-27T15:53Z,@DarkNewb Oh im sorry. Didn't knew that if someone uploads its elsewere im not allowed to upload it here. Its called Sharing dumbass
,olekking,2013-04-27T17:33Z,"Why hasn't anybody uploaded the latest Riptide patch?

It fixes the 7.1 audio and USB headset issue in the game, it makes a screeching sound when you play, i simply can't play like this...

This is on the Steam forums posted by a developer:

""Update 5 as of April 27 0:34 CET: Patch for 7.1 audio issue released on Steam. Tested with most common headsets we saw mentioned as having issues on the Discussion boards. Would recommend testing it with low volume first just in case. 

Next & previous weapon actions can now be bound. Some other UI/localization issues and random crashes were fixed."""
,Ronzor,2013-04-28T05:24Z,"I tried using it, but my friend and I cant find each others games in the game lobby over LAN.
And before you ask, I did follow the instructions provided and our computers were connected to the  same LAN."
,Vencore,2013-04-28T14:48Z,Same here. I cant find friend game.
,Zurree,2013-04-28T16:52Z,"Alright, it seems that many are having the problem with not finding your friend or even be able to join. 

The search system for this game is poorly coded with less options than the origianl dead island (not sure why they removed some of the options)
I do no think that a crack will fix the find game problem. It has to be a patch/update in order to fix it.  

Even people with the game on xbox/steam are having the same problem so a update should be up soon."
,Zurree,2013-04-28T19:16Z,@olekking Beacuse that is a minor problem. They will include that with the bigger patch that fix more problems in the game than the 7.1 sound
,lltpb.se,2013-04-30T10:57Z,I installed it just like any other crack and tried to use my previous save file and the game no longer sees my save file and I have no idea where the save file that the fix created is located now! please help me.
