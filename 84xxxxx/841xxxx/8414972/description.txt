"Mason was a key member of Traffic in it's first and a couple of subsequent incarnations. 'Alone Together' staked out the solo territory from which Mason has rarely strayed: a rather relaxed and reserved take-off from hard rock, featuring somber, bittersweet melodies, basic guitar/keyboards arrangements, as well as Mason's restrained vocals and blues-derived though not bluesy Electric guitar. 'It's Like You Never Left' smoothed out some of the singers few edges, while simultaneously picking up pace: it has more polished and full scoring but little bite. Still, the record has some of Mason's best writing. The backup band included Graham Nash singing and Stevie Wonder on harmonica." ***

"Once again Mason, whose music has all but disappeared amid corporate machinations over the past few years, can offer new material in finished studio versions, and I bet he's genuinely happy about it. The vague romantic dolor of his songs, after all, is a professional gimmick rather than a personal commitment, and the welcome-back-folks title probably expresses his very deepest feelings. But for me it's like I was never here in the first place." C
