,lokii_187,2013-05-14T19:00Z,"The file is an image (*.iso) therefore it needs to be mounted using software, basically tricking the pc to believe it is a disc in a physical drive. First download a program called daemon tools lite, once it is installed you can open daemon and mount the *.iso file from the torrent. If it is mounted correctly it should show up in My Computer as if the CD were inserted into the drive, then just install and run. Cheers, if you have any issues let me know and I'll walk you through."
,DaLolz,2013-05-17T08:23Z,"Hey i already have something called magicISO on my comp, do i still need to install daemon lite? also wheres the install option for daemon, cause all i see is a couple of advertisements offering different downloads. Thanks for all your help, really do appreciate."
,DaLolz,2013-05-17T08:27Z,"Sorry found where to downloiad, the link was just really slow, but the other question still stands. Thanks again."
,lokii_187,2013-05-17T16:06Z,"I know that you can use magicISO, though I'm not familiar with it because I've used DaemonTools for so long lol basically with either program your goal is  to mount the image as a virtual-drive. With Daemon you just click the add image button, browse to the ISO file. Then once it has been added, click on it in the Daemon window and click the mount (play) button. Once this is done you will see it as a virtual drive in My Computer. Then simply install and run, goodluck."
,DaLolz,2013-05-17T22:55Z,"Ok so i mounted it through daemon tools, but now it just gives me all the folders empty and none of the files do anything. What am i supposed to click to install? Sorry and thanks again. Also the place daemon mounted it to is called BD-ROM Drive (D:) TK-RISEMINI if that helps at all"
,lokii_187,2013-05-18T02:25Z,"Ok so open Daemon tools, click add image and browse to file (ind.risegold.iso) click ok. Now the ind.risegold.iso file should appear above all the lower buttons in Daemon. Click on it, then click the play button which will mount the file. Now at the bottom it should show the virtual-drive as ""Rongold"". Double click on that, or browse to My Computer, either way it is now a drive on your system. Now that the RonGold folder is open, scroll down to setup.exe and install as you normally would. If that doesn't work you are missing a step somewhere, so try reading my comments over again from the beginning brother."
,DaLolz,2013-05-26T21:06Z,"Sorry couldn't respond till now,but i still cant get it to install right. I mean it DOES install but the only things that come up are 6 folders with nothing in them a few files .dll and .inf files and something called splash.exe, but no setup.exe or w/e. And the same things happens with magicISO, so its not just Daemon Tools."
,lokii_187,2013-05-27T07:50Z,"Notice the 57 current seeds, no other complaints? The game works 100% on windows XP through to windows 8, and well verified over 2 years of posting the file online. You just are not following the directions I have given you (3 times) properly. I offered my help and in return you are making my great upload look like it is faulty to any experienced user looking for this epic title. If you cannot figure out how to install an ISO image, which is pre-cracked with serial included, you should not be using TBP.... Sad but True"
,toonstruck2000,2013-06-04T22:06Z,Is there a cd key?
,lokii_187,2013-06-06T00:45Z,"Should be in the image directory, but for good measure here ya go :)

,myysickle,2013-06-08T01:12Z,I downloaded this and it all worked perfectly fine until the game starts. The mouse stays in the center of the screen and is frozen there.. Help Please :{
,lokii_187,2013-06-08T08:23Z,"Sounds like a graphics issue to me, first ensure all drivers are updated (even though it's an older game, can still cause issues). Or you can always try running in Win-XP compatibility mode by right-clicking game shortcut, accessing properties and its under the compatibility tab. May help, if not try uninstalling and re-installing. "
