this one is a complement to a collection that is already uploaded on the pirate bay: 
http://thepiratebay.is/torrent/6123160/James_Bond_Complete_Collection_%28iPod.Zune.PSP%29

i noticed there were problems whit operation thunderball ( it cannot be played on psp) so i converted operation thunderball to an mp4
i also added 007 Skyfall as an mp4, as an added bonus i also include casino royale 1966.mp4

so whit this three movies the collection is complete (at least until james bond 25th its released) NOTE: i converted them for psp, i tested them on cfw 6.60 psp 2001, so i dont know if the ipod touch or zune can play this files, if someone can kindly try it for me it would be great, this torrent include:

007 operation thunderball.mp4
007 skyfall.mp4
casino royale 1966.mp4
