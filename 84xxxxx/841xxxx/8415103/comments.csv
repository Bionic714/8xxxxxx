,primer_,2013-05-13T04:05Z,"Hey. Please buy this movie. If there's any filmmaker who you should support, it's Shane Carruth. He's completely independent. He even distributed the film himself, including its theatrical release (that never happens). He wrote it, directed it, starred in it, and even scored the damn thing. So buy it! It's on every platform and, if you don't like itunes or amazon, you can buy it straight from his website!
