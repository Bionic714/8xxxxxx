Joan Baez - Blessed Are... (1972 quad mix 24/96 lossless 4.0 DVD-A)

24/96 4.0 lossless MLP (DVD-Audio).
16/48 4.0 AC3 @ 440kbps (DVD-Video) for compatibility with standard DVD players.
Slight noise/crackle filtering applied (Izotope RX 2), no EQ, compression, or rear channel boost.

Converted from quad SQ encoded vinyl using a FOSGATE RESEARCH TATE II 101A hardware decoder.

Note:
The album came with a bonus quad 7" which included the songs "Maria Dolores" and "Deportee". Both are included.


"What it all adds up to on the new album is a score of unimaginatively-selected tunes that are competently arranged (by Norbert Putnam), monotonously performed, and then nicely padded out by an ace Nashville crew. It's a formula Joan's relied on before, and it's not improving any with age."
- Janet Maslin, Rolling Stone
