Seems to be missing from the torrent, and ...
The Spirit of Steamboat (October 2013) hasn't even been published yet!!

Why list these if they aren't in the torrent?

Do you even have #9?"
[T],TxJag,2013-05-27T18:12Z,@PirateBayUser255 I listed them so users know and don't ask me if I have those books. It's called informing the masses.
