Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, April 26 broadcast of The Alex Jones Show, Alex continues examination of the perplexing details surrounding the official Boston bombing narrative. 

He also gives a riveting report from West, Texas, the site of the fertilizer plant explosion that killed at least 15 people, where a massive police presence is preventing reporters from investigating and asking questions. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes former FBI translator and whistleblower Sibel Edmonds to explain the US roots of "Chechen" terrorism. 

We also welcome Syrian Girl to talk about a potential Syrian chemical weapon false flag attack, as well as Former Congressman and 2012 presidential contender Ron Paul to give us his take on how Congress plans to exploit our fears to take our liberties.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
