MediaChance Dynamic PHOTO-HDR is a new generation of High Dynamic Range image software with many advanced features, such as Pin Warping and Anti-Ghosting. A High Dynamic Range photography can be created by taking few photos with different exposure, then combining them in the software into a high dynamic file. The last thing is to tone-map the HDR image so we can see it in our screen, print it, post it on the web and enjoy. The HDR imaging and tone mapping brought last couple of years a new excitement into the digital photography. While HDR imaging has a very specific purpose for professional work (like CGI or image recognition), its various tone-mapping processes can be also used to turn an ordinary digital photo into a more dramatic and interesting work. Our software was not build as scientific tool.

We focused on the easy to understand, easy to use quick work-flow that can almost instantly produce interesting images. It should be an addition to your toolbox, for special purposes, not a pipe to run every single image you captured through it. Our Dynamic Photo HDR (DPHDR) can be actually used with a single RAW or JPG image with very good results.
