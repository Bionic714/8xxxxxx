All Music Album Review (by Cub Koda):

The Revels were a hard-partying group from California who are best known for their classic hit instrumental "Church Key." This compilation captures all their best singles, their lone album in its entirety, plus early demos and unreleased material in a package that catches their frat-band lightning in a bottle. Sam Eddy's piano work on "It's Party Time" is rock & roll at its irreducible best, while the guitar work here tips its hat to Duane Eddy regularly.
