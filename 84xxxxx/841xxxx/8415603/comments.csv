[T],h2obagger,2013-04-27T19:12Z,"Hi inglesa80, Looks like I inadvertently left off the .mp4 extension on the file name.  Try renaming it and I believe you will be OK, plays fine here."
,gunbower,2013-04-27T22:37Z,"hi h2obagger  it still comes up with a file just blank page  , even though thank you!!!!"
,nemster77,2013-04-27T23:26Z,"If you simply put .mp4 after the date it will work.
So the file will read ""Eastenders.20130426.mp4"""
,doorpro,2013-04-27T23:36Z,"Yes, simply add the .mp4 and you'll be fine"
[T],h2obagger,2013-04-28T00:53Z,"gunbower, Not sure if I follow your question but I see that that BIG ""Download"" button (was that there before?) seems to go to a dead page.  
The usual ""Magnet"" / ""Get this Torrent"" links work fine for me.  Just downed it again here & it came across just as it was sent it up. "
