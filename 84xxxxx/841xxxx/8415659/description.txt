The target of the matchmakers is widowed vintner Magali (Béatrice Romand), alone at her vineyard after the departure of her grown children. Her best friend (Marie Rivière) plots to pair her with a friendly businessman (Alain Libolt), while her son's girlfriend (Alexia Portal) schemes to introduce her to a high-school philosophy teacher. Rohmer's film was shown at the 1998 Venice Film Festival, the 1998 Telluride Film Festival, the 1998 Toronto Film Festival, and the 1998 New York Film Festival.
