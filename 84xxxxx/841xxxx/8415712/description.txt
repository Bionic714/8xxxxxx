Archa bláznů .


The setting for this adaptation of 
　　Anton Chekhov’s short story “Ward 
　　Number Six” is a rural hospital, where 
　　various bizarre beings come together. 
　　This allegory about totalitarianism 
　　also remained uncompleted. The fa- 
　　mous Czech artist Ester Krumba- 
　　chová contributed to this black-and- 
　　white mosaic that oscillates between 
　　a naturalistic description of human 
　　wretchedness and a desire for free- 
　　dom. The film, which only received 
　　its final form after the fall of Commu- 
　　nism, had its cinematic premiere in 
　　November 1990.
