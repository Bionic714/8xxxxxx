this is a great collection, though! i doubt the prelude has much, if any, real content that isn't in #1.  :-)

it's important to note for people who don't know, this miniseries is incomplete -- and image has now said t will never be completed, so it's another sad capstone to the founders' ""partnership"".

also, fans of the walking dead may be interested in this, as it's one of robert kirkman's superhero writing projects."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-27T12:23Z,"oh and tedsclai, about your invincible collection, do you know about supreme #67? it guest-stars omni-man. so not really an invincible crossover, but a character from that book. just f.y.i."
,tedsclai,2013-04-27T15:57Z,I did not know that. Thank you for the Supreme info.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-27T23:15Z,"Bah, humbug! Image United Prelude is just a .cbr put together with the four 4-page backup stories from Savage Dragon 153, Witchblade 131, Invincible 067 and Spawn 195, put together by a scanner. After all the trouble to find it in a seeded torrent, it's not worth posting!  ;-)"
,tedsclai,2013-04-28T10:32Z,Thanks for the info.
