According to the official DVDFab this is still the latest version. And I only release Official Final Releases :)"

,Bean-Bandit,2013-04-29T18:03Z,"They really slowed this thing down. The last version I used was 8.2 and it was much faster then this.

One other thing, I can't find where to turn off check for updates and it's telling me there's a newer version all the damn time. Can't find where that's at."

,greyaburton,2013-04-29T20:19Z,@bean bandit.looks like they removed the old update box option and now I only see a box with allow upgrading to beta version next to it.try unchecking that one.

,greyaburton,2013-04-29T21:15Z,"also,version 9038 is out and is available with crack on here already.thanks"
,Bean-Bandit,2013-04-29T23:20Z,"@greyaburton
