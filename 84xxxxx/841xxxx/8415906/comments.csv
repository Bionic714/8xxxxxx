,Muscarv2,2013-04-28T18:07Z,Anyone know why episode 04 never aired?? This is episode 5 (often numbered as episode 4 since it's the 4th one to air.)
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-29T05:06Z,"@Muscarv2: The content was too graphic which is apparently too much for the NBC Censors to handle. They decided to just skip the ep and act like it doesnt exist in the US

Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the 
Boston Marathon bombings. Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com 
(nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/). The webisodes will serve as a bridge 
between Episode 3 and Episode 5. 

The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not yet know when or where.
