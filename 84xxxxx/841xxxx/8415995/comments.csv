,heya0236,2013-04-27T08:54Z,"Awesome! Thank you. If you can, can you PLEASE upload Welcome To Myrtle Manor (s01e05- current) AND Hemlock Grove (s01e10-13) ? Thanks! Great work. ALWAYS 10/10 from Eztv!"
,Atticusz,2013-04-27T09:03Z,Is there even a full episode 4? How long does this one go for?
,Hancock79,2013-04-27T12:04Z,"""why the fuck would they try to ruin this show already""

because what's the United States if we can't overly sensitive pussies or scapegoat violent TV shows when we're far too lazy to do actual parenting?  FYI it supposedly aired in India tonight, or soon.  If not it'll be on the 8th of May in Australia."
,ikebibby91,2013-04-27T14:31Z,NYC has become a F*cking Bloomberg Nanny State. NBC is in NYC. F*ck Nanny state censorship from Commie Zionists. I'm boycotting this show. I'm sick o this Nanny State Crap from NYC.
,ikebibby91,2013-04-27T14:36Z,"NBC is In NYC. This is more Nanny State Control ala Bloomberg, same click. They could have just put up a warning but they want to see if you will suck their d*ck. "
,ElSaborAsiatico,2013-04-27T18:41Z,"I believe it was actually Bryan Fuller, the show runner, who requested that the episode be pulled, so it was not really a ""nanny state"" situation. Although I agree 100% that it was a pointless and unnecessary decision."
,d4rk3nigm4,2013-04-27T20:21Z,"So...like, is this the real 4th episode? Because I really don't want to watch the 5th until I see the actual 4th."
,muHatha4,2013-04-27T23:55Z,to Hancock79: 5/1 in Europe.
,Hancock79,2013-04-28T18:16Z,"thanks Muhatha.  and the guy who asked, no this is not the ""real"" episode 4 it's the bits in between mainly just conversations between the main characters.  Totally took out the weekly plot:  Molly Shannon plays a teacher who talks children in to killing other children."

,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-29T06:55Z,"1x04 -- Apr 25, 2013 -- Ceuf -- PULLED -UNAIRED

Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the Boston Marathon bombings. 

Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com 
www.nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/ 

The webisodes will serve as a bridge 
between Episode 3 and Episode 5. 

The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not yet know when or where.

,temo2k,2013-05-02T00:05Z,"The removal of the episode was a publicity stunt.

Nothing reflects the Boston bombing, but now you have all these kiddies clamouring for Hannibal as if NBC withholding a show you never watch somehow infringes your rights. It's all marketing, suckers."
,Squito,2013-05-02T12:12Z,"Well Kesha asked the media not to broadcast her song Die young after a school shooting which is okay, but postpone Hannibal because of a massacre and a bombing? Pfff..."

this site has the full episode. Its Chinese AXN, annoying subs but worth watching the full the episode."
,ambiotic,2013-05-25T22:24Z,"oeuf, not ceuf
However, I do realize that this grammatical error rises right to the top of the show's staff.  Therefore, I can't just blame the downloaders and uploaders.
The French spelling is a ligature of the letters o and e.
Also, when taking the subject matter of this episode into consideration, it makes complete sense that it should be oeuf (french word for egg), and not ceuf.
