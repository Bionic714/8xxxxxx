,extracube,2013-06-07T06:36Z,"Big fat warning to english speakers -- this program is 100% non-english. Yes the main console can be switched later, but install / uninstall are unreadable.

Also I agree with user Britzolas above, for some reason my OS wouldn't allow me to copy the .dll file in the Kaspersky program folder.  

Removed this and will probably delete as well.  I appreciate the uploaders efforts but this is a no go."
