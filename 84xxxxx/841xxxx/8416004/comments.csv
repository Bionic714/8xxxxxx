Thanks for the ul!"
,tpbbabu,2013-05-05T08:23Z,"Why all your torrents take so much time to download ? 

Most of the time i get a down speed of 3 to 7 kbps while grabbing your torrents. 

Right now im downloading servant of the bones and it says 17 seeders , out of which 8 are connected , and im getting a speed of 7 to 11 kbps maximum ;("
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-05-05T20:06Z,"I'm sure it was just a typo babu, but your comment looks like you're sad about getting faster download speeds. lol

I don't have any idea why you would be getting slow download speeds. Everything I've downloaded recently has been super fast. And as you say, there is plenty of seeders."
,tpbbabu,2013-05-06T05:53Z,"Downloading

[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-05-06T09:21Z,"babu, it's not that I don't care, but I really don't have an answer for you. I've uploaded something in the order of 1000 torrents (many thousands of books within them). It's simply not possible for me to keep all of them seeded personally. I put them out there in the great PB community, hope that enough people keep them seeded for long enough that everybody who wants them gets them, and then I move on. It actually took me a while to figure that out, too. If I kept all of my torrents seeded the DL rates you mention are whate everyone would be getting on all of them. I simply do not have enough bandwidth to support that many seeds at one time. Further, are you going to seed this book or Pickle once you've downloaded them? See, it's a never ending, circular problem. Everybody wants, but very few people are willing to help. Anyway, I'll step off the soapbox. I re-started the Beach Safari torrent and let it complete to two full copies available, where it IMMEDIATELY dropped back to one (me), because WHOEVER finished downloading stopped their seed the split second the book had downloaded. *shrug*"
,tpbbabu,2013-05-07T15:26Z,"its ok bro . i understand .
i mean you're doing a real fantastic job giving us all these comics for free and im greatfull to you for that :) 

sorry if i sounded rude or anything.

and yeah , i realised , its not your fault , the other downloaders should contribute too by seeding in a good speed.

waiting more goodies from you . thanks :)"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-05-10T06:23Z,"Cool man, I didn't really mean to sound so preachy, either. I've got TONS of stuff lined up, but I've been ill for a bit and I'm just coming out of it right now. I'll get back to uploading shortly."
