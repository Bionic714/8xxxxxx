A compelling fantasy/horror series set in the heart of present-day Nagasaki, Japan, CROSSING MIDNIGHT begins when extraordinary twins are born - one just before midnight and the other just after. They discover the huge impact this small difference has on their destinies when one of them is inducted into a world of supernatural beings and events that intersects with our own world. Together, the twins will try to stay one step ahead of their terrifying fates while they learn how far their new world of terror intersects with their own.
