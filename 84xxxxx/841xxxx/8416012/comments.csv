And yeah, you can throw in the ""Super Hero"" camp run as well, even if it embarrassed the frack out of poor Dick Dillin to draw that mess...:(

STFM, you agree on this guy's heroics?

Hell, I even have those awful romance comics from back then, as well as the westerns from the GA, and pretty much anything else you can think of!"
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-27T20:01Z,"...Nah, the romance stuff never interested me, but who knows? Some of the female pirates may need advice to the lovelorn. :P

...But those Quality military comics that gave us the Blackhawks were priceless. Had an opportunity come up about 40 years ago to buy a complete collection of Modern, Military and Blackhawk from a Half-Priced Books for half-cover.

I'll let that sink in for a minute.

...Sadly, by the time I got back with the $20 that would have allowed me to purchase comics decades older than me, and only a decade later would have been worth a fortune, some cocksucker bought them all. In the space of 30 minutes and a shift change - the punk who changed shifts with the kindly old hippie sold the stack, thinking the idiot who bought them was me ""because a ten-year-old kid wouldn't have $20 to buy funny books!""

...The good side is that I was able to get the bastard fired - Dad knew the owner, which helped - but I still didn't have the comics. I ended meeting the bozo who did about 16 years later, when he was selling them at about 75% what Bob Overstreet wanted for them, and walked out of the con with the high end of four digits and some change. Which probably meant he was able to afford four new tires.

I'll let that one sink in too.
