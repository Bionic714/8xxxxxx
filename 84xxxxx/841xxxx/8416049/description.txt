 Blue Öyster Cult (often abbreviated BÖC) is an American rock band from Long Island, New York, United States, best known for such hard rock songs as "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", "Burnin' for You", and "Godzilla". Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially "Burnin' for You", received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÖC's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.

Blue Öyster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).

Tyranny and Mutation (on the album cover: THE BLVE ÖYSTER CVLT: TYRANNY AND MVTATION) was the second album by the American hard rock band Blue Öyster Cult, released in 11 February 1973.

The album was recorded from tunes written while touring in support of their eponymous first album. BÖC continued to develop their style of "intelligent heavy metal" on this record. This was the first BÖC album to feature a contribution from punk poet Patti Smith, who would go on to co-write several songs for the band and at one time dated Allen Lanier as well.

The song "The Red and the Black" is a re-titled, re-recorded version of the band's "I'm on the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep" from their first studio album. The lyrics are a reference to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
