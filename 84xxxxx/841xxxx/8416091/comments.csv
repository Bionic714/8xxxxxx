Think of it this way...today you've got 2 new listings to catch up on! Hooray!

Coming later: short clip from Varney & Company with Stuart's interview with Grover Norquist on the Internet Sale Tax bill. Really interesting theory on what the bill is really intended to do: lay initial groundwork for f*#ked high-tax states to reach out and grab at revenue from former residents currently fleeing to lower tax states. Here I thought it was mostly about Amazon smashing small startups who wouldn't be able to cover the overhead of filing sales tax returns in all 50 states, so they'd have to join Amazon as affiliate sellers.

Anyway...it's mad mad mad mad bad bad news. Fight it. Tell your reps you don't want your in-state business to be subject to coersion from another state's tax authority."
