,EnemyDrone,2013-04-27T08:02Z,How did the Huns get this st?? lol. oh well still going to the cinema to see it..
,PookaHookah,2013-04-27T09:55Z,"It's out in a week guys. Wait and see it in theaters. I bet it's going to totally be worth the 5 bucks. Or, if you can't swing a fiver, there are a multitude of ways to easily sneak in to any movie. : ]

It's a piece of shit. Thanks to the uploader for the trouble, but seriously guys, just have a modicum of patience."
,saint84,2013-04-27T10:22Z,"PookaHookah, you are probably not from west europe or the us . and it is out already by the way . 5 bucks for the movie? you are dreaming. more like $10.00 at least . "
,saint84,2013-04-27T10:23Z,"ghostnest . you already uploaded your hungarian shit here . so why do it again . same release , really?"
,PookaHookah,2013-04-27T10:39Z,"@Saint84: Actually yes, I do live in the U.S. and it comes out May the third here. Don't make assumptions. I know it may be out earlier in some countries, so how about my comment is only in relation to those areas where the movie isn't out yet. Does that satisfy your nitpicking? And yes, 5 dollars. Oh wait, sorry $5:75. Go at 11 am. So no, I'm not dreaming."
,saint84,2013-04-27T11:55Z,"PookaHookah . then, don't assume anything . and $5.75 is not for most of us . we work , so 11 am is not on most of us . so yes, i wa right about my statements . and yes it is out in europe . so you are talking only for yourself, and this is not useful "
,PookaHookah,2013-04-27T16:47Z,"@Saint: Dude, you're an idiot. People who work have what is called ""Days off"". Mind blowing concept for you apparently. Agian, I know it's out in Europe. My comment that people should wait and go see it in theaters was for people in the U.S. So, shut the fuck up. You're annoying. No one else found issue with my comment but you. That should tell you something. So again, just to reiterate, shut the fuck up."
,Mrpell,2013-04-29T06:58Z,If this has better quality audio then all the re-uploads of a crappy ENG CAM release then maybe it's time more people learn hungarian so at least you can understand what the hell people are saying! :D
