The Hidden Cameras, like The Polyphonic Spree, specialize in swooning pop. The songs on HC's debut album revolve around communal living, gay love, and religious imagery. Singer/guitarist Joel Gibb's 15-member band (some of whom don little more than balaclavas when playing live) overcome possible charges that they're a novelty act thanks to GibbΓÇÖs knack of creating expansive, uplifting songs layered with flute, harp, trombone, and sleigh bells. "Day is Dawning" begins as a gently strummed paean to creation and slowly builds into a lilting, choral-tinged thing of loveliness. "Boys of Melody" is similarly beguiling, as Gibb gazes "far out at sea bathed in breeze" over the most simple, affecting melody this side of Mercury Rev. --Suzannah Brown
