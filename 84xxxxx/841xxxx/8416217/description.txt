I haven't read this novel yet, but it's said to be extremely disturbing. Fair warning.

On the other hand, American novelist Fiona Maazel recently described herself as an "evangelist" for this book. She wrote: Not everyone's cup of tea. And for good reason. The novel's about a mechanic turned pederast turned Nazi who's also the Christ bearer, in one way or another. Unbelievably beautiful, rich prose. Dark--so dark--but clear-eyed when it comes to observing the world."
