,mdesmet,2013-04-27T10:13Z,Thanks for the Upload!
,Asylumsaint,2013-04-27T12:43Z,For some reason it isnt downloading for me.... Have no problems with any other torrents.  I got something that downloaded at 3mbs a second but this wont download?  Says 2weeks and barely 10-50kbs if im lucky
,vincegun,2013-04-27T19:15Z,"I'm assuming it's due to the 10bit stuff, but my htpc isn't capable of playing this rip back smoothly. I haven't tried the other 5gig one, but I can't seem to merge the subtitles correctly despite following the directions so there's no point in trying.

I dunno.

Hurray for high quality rips, no doubt, but not everyone uses a quad-core machine for their htpc."
,Dyingatheist,2013-04-27T19:56Z,"@vincegun, I'll post the 720p version when it comes out in a few days followed by the SD version.

All you have to do to play the subtitle file is change the .txt to .ass if it's not .ass already, then open the video, subtitles -> open file -> open the .ass file. That should do the trick."
,vincegun,2013-04-28T03:49Z,"Yeah, I tried that. No dice. There's nothing special about my windows install, nor my media player (I use both MPC and VLC) so I don't know what's up.

It's no big deal. I watched it without the english subs and then went to wikipedia to see what it was all about. Thanks for answering, though. I'll just pick up a non-10bit 1080 rip when someone puts one up."
,Dyingatheist,2013-04-28T20:37Z,"@vincegun, coreavc 3.0.1 won't work properly with the video file. Check to see if that's what you have and maybe try something else. Also, you could try the 720p torrent on my profile.

,JoaquinAR,2013-04-28T23:18Z,"@Dyingatheist: thanks THANKS for this great quality!

@vincegun: so you don't have a quad core for your HTPC... WHO THE F. CARES?!? Go download some 600mb shitty stuff and f(#% off!

@everybody else having issues playing: is probable not because the 10bit but because the FLAC. Some players doesn't like it at all."
,andrewIII,2013-04-29T02:36Z,"Can anyone tell me how I can play the subtitles on MPC? I know how to do it on VLC, but VLC won't play this for shit, but MPC runs it fine."
,vincegun,2013-05-03T18:31Z,"@Joa: You weren't part of the conversation so don't get involved if you can't and won't help. Also, watch the attitude. There's no reason to be a dick, especially since you're in no way obligated to read the comments nor respond to them.

@Dying: Thing is, my htpc is a simple atom/ion machine (Asus AT3N7A-I). Everything else in my library works flawlessly on XBMCbuntu except a heavy-duty Avatar rip I have and this rip. It's not the most capable machine in the world, but it does what it's supposed to in a very, very small package.  But hey, thanks for trying to troubleshoot for me!"
,hexapod2k,2013-05-04T21:28Z,Why am I getting green screen when playing this with VLC? I am having the same problem with the 4.18Gb one as well. Am using Windows 7. 
,scythe06,2013-05-10T22:18Z,Awesome upload thanks Dyingatheist 
,Ghosthands,2013-05-31T04:42Z,"Both this and the 720p UTW versions don't work on my extremely powerful media box or my equally powerful PC. They just give black screen. It's not a FLAC issue. You've done something strange with your video encode. 
Please use normal encoding methods for compatibility in future."
