,mentallyours,2013-04-27T20:04Z,"Carmelo Anthony scored a game-high 26 points, taking the lead in a dominating effort by the New York Knicks, as the visitors cruised to a 90-76 win over the Boston Celtics. With the victory, the Knicks have taken commanding 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven first round series. Raymond Felton added 15 points and 10 assists for the Knicks, who nearly led the game from start to finish, thanks to a stifling defensive effort. The Knicks forced 18 turnovers, and scored 26 points off those miscues, while Boston struggled to score the ball for the third consecutive game in the series. Jeff Green had a team-high 21 points in the setback.
