This is dubbed to DVD format as an ISO image.

Blond Ambition has never been released on DVD.

This is not the crappy Japan lazer disc or HBO VHS version.

Please seed for Maddy

And we will buy the DVD when they finally do release it. :-) 

Please do buy copies of Madonna CDs and DVDs. I preview via torrent then I pay my dues for the hard copy. "
