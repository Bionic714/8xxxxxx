Easily remove spyware and malware

Spyware Process Detector is an anti-spyware tool that will detect all processes running on the computer and display their threat rating based on the intelligent analysis of all hidden properties. With this software, unsafe processes can be determined by rating of danger.
The program is also able to detect a process that contains and executes alien code of another process. Users can view the detailed information about any selected process and detect all hidden threats, including spyware, malware, keyloggers and trojans. 
Unlike the standard Windows Task Manager, Spyware Process Detector will also detect transparent processes and tasks. The security rating is color-coded so that users can easily see the most dangerous processes.
Red stands for the highest rating of danger, green for the lowest one, any color between red and green stands for varying levels of security threat. The program shows other details about each process, such as process ID, parent ID, security status, EXE filename, file path, description etc.
