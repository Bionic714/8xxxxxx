,beanrman,2013-04-27T10:07Z,"Works great, If anyone has any kind of problems with the activation goto C:Users(username)AppDataLocalMirillis and open ico_update.png with note pad and just delete everything in it and save and close it. Now right click on ico_update.png and select properties and check read only and save it. It works for any Mirillis app. Thanks Cyclonoid for uploading. "
,Pituto,2013-04-29T02:37Z,Thanks! It seems to work!!
,Fu2chN,2013-04-29T15:10Z,The key was put in black list.
,L4j3c,2013-05-02T11:34Z,The serial number you have entered is blacklisted.

3.Remove the registry branch HKCU  Software  Mirillis  Action  License

,whip_lash,2013-05-15T10:26Z,"The included instructions don't work. I did a lot of research and a lot of testing in a VM, and here's some (hopefully) fool-proof directions. Please tell me if it works or not.

Tested on:
Windows 7 x64
Windows 8 x64


If you've got a ""Licence key blacklisted"" message
===================================
1. Delete contents of C:Windowswindefendam.log using your favorite editor, set file as read-only
2. Delete HKCUSoftwareMirillisActionLicense (in your registry)

If you haven't installed it yet
===================================
1. Install program like any other program, DO NOT RUN YET

You have a clean/cleaned install and are ready to activate
===================================
1. Download a 3rd party firewall (Try tinywall.pados.hu), you cannot use the built-in Windows firewall (try it if you don't believe me)
2. Block the following two programs (paths are not important for most firewalls):
Action.exe
dwm.exe
3. Run Action!
4. Activate with the included serial

They've done a bunch of clever bullshit to prevent activation with a blacklisted serial, but it looks like they missed a spot :)"
,whip_lash,2013-05-15T10:28Z,"Just in case it wasn't obvious:
===================================
C: Windows windefendam.log"
,whip_lash,2013-05-15T10:29Z,"Grr...
HKCU Software Mirillis Action License 

It's too bad TPB won't let you delete your own comments..."
,Ja_som,2013-05-15T18:09Z,"finally, it works, thank you so much... 
:)"
,C1hrisin,2013-05-16T19:21Z,Thank you Cyclonoid for this torrent and thanks whip_lash my heroes :D
