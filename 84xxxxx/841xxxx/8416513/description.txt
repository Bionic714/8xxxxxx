The text describes a method of meditation practice for forcing vital energies of a body into their central channel (Sushumna), through its lower entry point below the navel. The experience thus gained lays a practical foundation for subsequent Buddhist meditative practices of Knowledge and Nirvanic Paths. The method described is based on personal experiences of the author of the text.
