Two segments clipped from this show:

1) Grover Norquist talks about the Senate's "Marketplace Fairness Act", whether the House is going to be able to kill it, and his take on the motivations actually behind it.

2) Judge Andrew Napolitano on the initial questioning of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: how the FBI might have mishandled it by not coordinating internal efforts properly.
