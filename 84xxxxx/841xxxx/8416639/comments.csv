thanks dude.."
[T],The_Duck1,2013-04-30T22:27Z,hmmm first you call it a fake torrent then you blame me for putting some keylogger & malicious program in it and now you ask me to help you?????
[T],The_Duck1,2013-05-01T05:36Z,"But why you say there is a  keylogger & malicious program and it's a fake torrent? i realy i don't get it.

I think you was thinking:
It's not working good for me so there is a virus in it.
This one is the same then:
The streets are wet so it rained before. No there was a child played with water on the street that's why it was wet.

And yes i always check my torrent before i post. and no i don't know what's wrong with it on your pc."
