CamBlocker

Is someone spying on you through your web camera? CamBlocker enables you to block all your web cameras, when you don't need them, and protect yourself from being spied on. You can also password protect CamBlocker and prevent your teenager, or anybody else, from using a web camera. The program stays out of way in system tray area, with minimal use of system resource.
