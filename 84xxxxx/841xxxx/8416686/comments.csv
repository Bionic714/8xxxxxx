No Randi Rhodes this week ?"
[T],480v,2013-04-28T08:31Z,"No I couldn't get her due to scheduling conflict. Clear Channel doesn't allow her to be as accessible as say Limbaugh so choices are limited. She's the only liberal talker not on either the Progressive Voices outlet or Tunein. The only way to listen to her on tunein is through one of Clear Channel stations on there, but again that goes back to scheduling issues with maybe two CC stations you can get her from."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-04-28T20:21Z,"Here in Southern California the airwaves are owned by conservatives, so we're stuck with Limbaugh, Hannity, and Michael Medved.   But no progressive radio since the mid 2000s.   No Ed Schultz here since at least 2005 or 06.  Not sure we ever had Randi Rhodes.

Keep the political radio coming! Thanks, man."
