,pwnt_soup,2013-04-27T19:02Z,is this the same copy with really bad audio that you cant hear at all? I downloaded 3 copys today and all are the same unwatchable copy with size between 1.2 and 1.4 gb. thanks for the effort but its unwatchable unless you can read lips and are hard of hearing anyway.
,majikku22,2013-04-27T19:13Z,@su0nak - wow Hardc0re7...you change your name more on here than I change my underwear!  Nice try but go spam somewhere else!
,majikku22,2013-04-27T19:14Z,"As far as I know, no other copies with good audio are available.  Two different english versions both with horrible audio and the Hungarian speaking version."
,watchawant,2013-04-27T23:05Z,Anybody knows where I can get english subtitles compatible with this ? Audio is so bad you don't understand anything they say.
,watchawant,2013-04-27T23:10Z,Would be nice to get some subtitles with that.
,T912938,2013-04-27T23:18Z,"If you are using Media Player Classic Home Cinema, go to View >>> Options >>> Internal Filters >>> Audio Switcher, and set ""Boost"" all the way to max."
,letmedos56,2013-04-27T23:29Z,"It is hungarian and quality really sucks so I was searching for better one aonline and found great HD copy, search over internet this tag ""4ron2man3"" "
,mustan7,2013-04-27T23:54Z,awesome torrent
,starlite2,2013-04-27T23:55Z,"Sync issues? Blame the codec and the wrapper. XviD and .avi are notorious for causing sync issues not present in the source. Uploaders, time to wake up to the Millenium... it's 2013, not 1992... stop using .avi. kthxbai."
,mavchampps,2013-04-28T00:29Z,"Yikes....the audio really is bad.  Video is decent, though."
,majikku22,2013-04-28T01:12Z,I'm surprised no one has done subtitles for it yet.
,Mrpell,2013-04-28T01:13Z,"Video quality is not too bad but the audio is very bad.

Bad in that the audio is so low even with 400% noise amplification in ffdshow audio decoder it still has a lot of noise and even using a noise filter it just makes the audio harder to hear.

Also beware of FAKES. Seeing as there is no dvd or blueray rip available yet and the fact that certain sites on the net are trying to con people to visit sites, take surveys to get a password for a rar file, then register and then the ultimate con, trying to con you to give out credit card information so they can con you further for fake content.

So in short beware of assholes trying to convince you to visit site(s) for perfect quality rips that do not exist yet. Unless you like giving out credit card information to con artists that is."
,majikku22,2013-04-28T01:28Z,"I wouldn't care if the audio was out of sync as long as I could hear somewhat more clearly!  Damn, even I can fix the sync issues...this low audio sucks more than the sync issue!"
,firedart,2013-04-28T01:35Z,"who sees this shit,omg,screeners?"
,3vil-G,2013-04-28T03:13Z,"Why do all the copies of this film I download and watch have the sound of someone rustling away through their shopping trolley looking for their cheese butties and flask?

Great video quality but not worth bothering with if all you can hear is rustle rustle scratch scratch.. the occasional bit of dialogue and more rustle rustle rustle.

Save your bandwidth guys.

Also, don't bother with the people posting  telling you that you can get excellent quality rips at all these other links they are posting. It's just crap designed to rip you off or infect your PC. There are no better versions of this film, especially BLURAY quality.

Stick to TPB and wait for a trusted good copy!"
,sharpshot94549,2013-04-28T03:21Z,"Lets see here, there was iron man, the incredible hulk, iron man 2, thor, captain america, and the avengers. Know what they all had in common, they all had scenes during and/or after the credits. this guy clearly never saw them or he would know to keep filming until the end."
,jon1831,2013-04-28T03:49Z,"i wont even bother downloading....lol get it together and for the dumb ass @SuL9a, get your SPAM OUT OF HERE, do not go to the link its a scam.....google it"
,ufalum88,2013-04-28T04:15Z,"Sound bad like everyone says, especially around 1:09 mark where it sounds like the filmer is doing unnatural acts with the camera."
,ManinBlue,2013-04-28T10:54Z,"i watched 10 min of it while i played with the audio filters on vlc media player... 
if u leave everything flat and crank up only 1 slider it is possible to hear MOST of the dialogue pretty good!!! 

just crank the slider that says 6 kHz- 19.2 dB

worked pretty good for me!!! hope it works for u too... 
enjoy!"
,ManinBlue,2013-04-28T10:56Z,note- i was streaming from utorrent... we'll c how the rest of the movie is when it finishes.
,ManinBlue,2013-04-28T11:01Z,sry... forgot u have to slide the pre amp slider all the way up as well... (it is on the far left of the audio filter.)
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-28T12:11Z,"need legends to be able to fallow it,but what about the movie itself ?Guzs that has watched is this worth dling?"
,GavinFace,2013-04-28T13:37Z,Why are you godamn ass fuckers so desperate that you have to watch this movie in fucking SHITHOUSE CAM QUALITY?  Be patient and at least wait for a dvd rip to be uploaded you fucking gutter dwelling cock pigs.
,Sierran2u,2013-04-28T15:13Z,"Well heres an outrageous idea. Instead of complaining about the bad audio, as we all know that cam jobs are expected to be bad anyway, how about actually coughing up the money to see it yourself? As clearly LegendET has done. Or atleast wait for a dvd or brrip. Although no matter the quality, your effort is appreciated LegendET."
,schploym,2013-04-28T18:11Z,"Maybe we're all so desparate to see this that we're willing to go through the hassle of watching a shitty cam, you think? 

Maybe we think that it's fucking retarded that a movie made by a company located in the United States is being released worldwide BEFORE it is released in the US. YOU THINK?

If you're not here to download the torrent, maybe you should shut your fucking mouth instead of talking down to people who just want to watch the movie already."
,BosuxRedsux,2013-04-28T20:52Z,thanks
,MailerDaemon0,2013-04-28T23:12Z,"3 words:

Worst....Audio....EVER.

A:1 (that's generous)
V:7.5 (Good for a cam)

M:? I deleted it after 5 min b/c of the truly awful audio so your guesses are as good as mine at this point. 

Wanted to see what all the fuss was about with this torrent and now that I know, I'm happy to wait for someone to slap some better audio on this and re-release it hopefully not in an .avi wrapper... .mkv or even .mp4 (if done right) would be better and fix the audio sync issues as well.

Thx as always for the up, appreciate it."

,BOLT_PRIDE,2013-04-29T06:49Z,"Honestly t8ball, even with that improvement, the audio is still about as bad as it gets. Every fourth word is barely understandable. I'm gonna wait for a better cam or a rip. Thanks for the effort though!"

,GavinFace,2013-04-29T10:20Z,"@schploym I'm glad that you acknowledged that YES YOU ARE DESPERATE.  And yes I agree that it sucks that the movie is released elsewhere first. But you know what? Whether or not you see it NOW, or in a few weeks/months in good quality dvd/blue ray, What fucking difference does it make? The movie will be the same. Only instead of RUINING the movie by watching this FUCKING TRASH quality, you could actually be patient and wait for the good quality version.  What the fuck is wrong with you? do you have ADHD or something? Why do you settle for *SHIT*? Personally I will wait, and watch the dvd or blue ray rip and watch it in good quality while sipping some fine wine and i will fucking enoy it while thinking 'wow im glad im not a fucking piece of shit retard who was so impatient and desperate that i watched a piece of fucking shit cam version for filthy vagrant bums'."
,Quasso,2013-04-29T14:52Z,Do not download. It's so worth paying for to see.
,JayMcPot,2013-04-29T17:24Z,ok ive been using TPB for a really long time and i JUST created an account just to say this (and i know im gonna get trolled for this by some douchebag but whatever...) we all know its a cam... hence the shit quality... if you dont like it dont be a cheap bastard and go watch it in theater or wait for dvdrip... its FREE so if youre gonna download it please dont complain about the quality when you know what to expect as soon as you see CAM real big at the top... thanks uploader regardless of quality for at least trying to give us cheap people a free movie!

,briebee72,2013-05-01T00:30Z,"Pink50 I have to agree ..

Movie video: it is fair maybe vhs quality def pretty good compared to alot of cams

Audio: horrid hollow quiet and crappy very very very bad audio. with 2 parts with lots of noise that you cant hear anything maybe camera movment or what i dont know but lasrt about 20 seconds and dont happen during any important parts.

Movie itself  seriously wtf: 2 hours of bullshit. chopped up story , first 30 mins almost make no sence what so ever. and then you get actual iron man in the movie for all of 15 mins out of the 2 hours once when he gets his house blown up he getsin suit but nothing  really just to save him self and then for 3 mins when he saves the airplane people and then for the last 10 mins of movie during the final fight  that is also pointless. the rest of the movie is just chopped up story robert downy junior acting like an ass. and magical people who melt shit with hands  really stupid.   seriously iran man suits survive anything in other movies missles to chest tank blast you name it but in this movie the magic heat people can just disable then in 2 seconds with magic heat hands and then cut them in half like paper in 1 second flat really stupid story line and poor put together movie. i agree pink 50 if i had paid for this shit movie i would have been pissed."
,mtim86,2013-05-01T01:16Z,"@briebee72 I agree every word you and @pink50 said.
