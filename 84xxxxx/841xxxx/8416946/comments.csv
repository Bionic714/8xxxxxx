I Know you didn't even had the time yet to upload the remaining of the X-Men Classic Run (46-110), but I was wandering if you would have the ""X-Men: Mutant Genesis 2.0."" hardcover?

The main reason this book is remarkable is because it was remastered and recolored in modern style with beautiful computer colors. I once had this book in my hands but I don't why I didn't buy it, but I still regret not having that version of this book in my collection!

If you still have any doubts, here is the link to Amazon:

Have I nice weekend!"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-27T22:45Z,"ggaanneesshhaa, i've never seen a .cbr of that hardcover, sorry. back in 2011, marvel did release the first chapter/issue from the hardcover as a 20th anniversary special:

i'd love to see the rest of it, but like ""the judas coin"" it's been a long wait to see if a scan group will release it online..."
