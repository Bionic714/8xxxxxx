The Texas-born, Louisiana-raised Marcia Ball has released ΓÇ£Roadhouse AttractionsΓÇ¥, her fifth album for Alligator Records, and a celebration of forty years on the road, containing her usual joyous mix of boogie and Gulf Coast blues that canΓÇÖt leave you with anything less than a smile on your face!
Based in Austin since 1970 the award-winning pianist / singer / writer is multi-award winning and on ΓÇ£Roadside AttractionsΓÇ¥ she has delivered a winning 12-track collection, recorded in Nashville and Austin, and produced by Gary Nicholson, who has worked with the likes of Delbert McClinton and Wynonna Judd, and has also co-penned some of the songs.
Things get off to a trademark start with the rollicking ΓÇ£ThatΓÇÖs How It GoesΓÇ¥, which apart from BallΓÇÖs rolling piano and fine vocal, features some tasteful slide guitar from Colin Linden and the great Reese Wynans soloing on Hammond B-3 organ; the swampy title cut of ΓÇ£Roadside AttractionsΓÇ¥ follows, with LindenΓÇÖs gritty guitar again underpinning more joyous piano work. Marcia BallΓÇÖs own ΓÇ£ΓÇ¥Between Here And Kingdom ComeΓÇ¥ slows things down ΓÇô a beautiful song and a definite highlight.
ΓÇ£We Fell HardΓÇ¥ has a New Orleans feel, with more great piano, and the horns of Dan Bechdolt, Steve Butts and Greg Wilson featured, with some funky grooves from Don Bennett on bass and Damien Llanes on drums. ΓÇ£Look Before You LeapΓÇ¥ is a ΓÇÿkillerΓÇÖ Texas shuffle, a co-write with the legendary Dan Penn and Gary Nicholson, with some scorching guitar from Mike Schermer, and the whole track swings beautifully.
The soulful ballad ΓÇ£I Heard It AllΓÇ¥ is a sorrowful tale of a couple having a hotel ΓÇÿdomesticΓÇÖ, with Colin LindenΓÇÖs slide guitar sorrowful here; the Southern soul feel of ΓÇ£Believing In LoveΓÇ¥ taking things up again, with Reese Wynans featuring again. I could be wrong, but ΓÇ£This Used To Be ParadiseΓÇ¥ sounds like a lament for the terrible pollution that was suffered in the Gulf of Mexico, from a personal perspective, with Joel GuzmanΓÇÖs sweet accordion giving that authentic Louisiana Cajun edge to the song.
Elsewhere ΓÇ£Sugar BoogieΓÇ¥ is pretty self-explanatory, a great swinger with all the band kicking up a storm, as Marcia Ball herself fires off some sparkling piano solos, traded with Mike SchermerΓÇÖs guitar licks; ΓÇ£Mule Headed ManΓÇ¥ is a slow blues, where Ball laments the man in question, who is most definitely stubborn and does his own thing! This highly recommended collection ends on a storming note with the rocking ΓÇ£The PartyΓÇÖs Still Going OnΓÇ¥ . . . forty years on it certainly is for this much-loved lady of the blues and boogie!
