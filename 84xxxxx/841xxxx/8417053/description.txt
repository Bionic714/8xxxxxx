Review:
This mockumentary from Director Matt Dworzanczyk was produced from highlights of his recent holiday to North Korea. Tourists normally pay upto $3000 for the right to visit the "Hermit Kingdom" and this film gives you the opportunity to see inside the reclusive country. Unfortunately Matt's anti North Korean bias is obvious, and the exaggerated storyline and post-production gives it a somewhat pornographic feel, like an episode of "A Current Affair". Nevertheless, this is one of the better films that have been made by tourists to the DPRK in recent years and makes for entertaining viewing.

Rating: 3 stars



Update: Get this film before they ban it!

There has been speculation that this film is part of a recent wave of anti North Korean propaganda, designed to sway opinion before further US sanctions. Even hack group Anonymous seems to be involved: http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/anonymous-hackers-take-control-of-north-korean-propaganda-sites/
