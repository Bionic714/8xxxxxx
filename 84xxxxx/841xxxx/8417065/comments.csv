A:3

Not finished downloading yet but from the part I could play the audio sounds bad. Watchable if you are desperate."

,Mrpell,2013-04-28T01:17Z,"Also beware of FAKES. Seeing as there is no dvd or blueray rip available yet and the fact that certain sites on the net are trying to con people to visit sites, take surveys to get a password for a rar file, then register and then the ultimate con, trying to con you to give out credit card information so they can con you further for fake content.

So in short beware of assholes trying to convince you to visit site(s) for perfect quality rips that do not exist yet. Unless you like giving out credit card information to con artists that is.

For example the assholes commenting in here to visit suspicious sites? If you visit them you are just asking for trouble."

Video quality is not too bad but the audio is very bad.

Bad in that the audio is so low even with 400% noise amplification in ffdshow audio decoder it still has a lot of noise and even using a noise filter it just makes the audio harder to hear."

for fucks sake man, you post more than spammers"
,K1bbler,2013-04-28T07:08Z,"Dear Marvel studios

The mandarin used to be the most badass villain in the iron man story. Thanks for taking a huge dump on the comics you loosely base your movies on. You clearly have no interest in making movie adaptations of comics but making movies to appease the drooling masses with fancy CGI and weak storylines to make a buck out of retarded Americans."
,michaelrwatson,2013-04-28T07:29Z,"@xxxlavalxxx: WHY NO F'KING SAMPLE you douche? 

WHY WHY WHY?? Do you score points by having people download the full movie before deleting it..?"
,bfldworker,2013-04-28T09:43Z,"Ok, I just got done watching this. The Audio as reported is bad. But you can hear everyone talk. The video isn't the greatest, but I have seen worse. 

There will be better versions. I would suggest you wait for a better version if you want to watch this.

As for this person that keeps posting about 400% noise amplification, ignore this person. It isn't THAT bad. But I will be honest this movie SUCKED!"
,ArloKills,2013-04-28T18:48Z,For people that have probs with audio i watched it with my Bose headphones with the volume low and I had no prob hearing everything. To the people that say it sucks have probs. they prob liked Green Lantern and thats the worst movie ever made
,bfldworker,2013-04-28T20:24Z,"As a HUGE Ironman fan, Let me slightly revise my opinion of the movie. Being the video isn't the best, the audio while you could hear it wasn't the best and whoever was holding the camera was figity at times. I will rate this movie good. The one commenter was correct. Marvel knew that it couldn't get any better then Avengers at least for now, so they did what they could do. Personally I think they could have played the Mandarin MUCH, MUCH better, they could have left the movie follow the comic book timeline better. But oh well, it is what it is. Thor 2 is right around the corner as is Captain American Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy as well as Avengers 2. I just hope this isn't the last Ironman film with RDJ "

,drcat123,2013-04-28T22:27Z,if you burn it to a dvd the sound is not really a issue. 
,Mrpell,2013-04-29T06:50Z,"@tdurden83 Sorry for the multiple comments pirate bay had lag issues for me and didn't show my comment so I assumed it didn't save. 

Only later on in the day did I see that it posted multiple times.. and since you can't delete your own comments its kind of hard to fix it."
,Mrpell,2013-04-29T06:52Z,@bfldworker You must have better hearing then I do because even with tweaking the audio I still had a hell of a time trying to hear the voices.
,nice_togio,2013-04-29T17:44Z,thanks for this one :)
