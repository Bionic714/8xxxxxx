Well no quite so, as this version has a bug at ""The Altar"" chapter (the bird flew, and can't get the 4th golden bee - so you got stuck). As always, there's a new version that solves all the bla, bla, bla... but is not available on TPB yet (the same thing at Cat-A-Cat version)."
,muLineZu,2013-05-21T19:23Z,"Correction: Cat-A-Cat version (Enigma Agency: The Case of Shadows CE (2013) PC [FINAL]) is OK, but if you install this one after uninstalling RedFoxyGames version, you'll have to create a new profile (start all over) or else you'll continue from where you got stuck."
