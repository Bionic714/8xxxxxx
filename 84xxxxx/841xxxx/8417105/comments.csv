,lukescoot,2013-04-27T16:34Z,"2 min of audio missing? Try again, its missing for almost the whole movie. You can BARELY hear anything, but might work with headphones, i havent tried yet. 

AUDIO - 1
VIDEO (for a cam) - 6.5

Video is decent, very watchable for a cam, but audio is very very weak."
,FunkiHomosapien,2013-04-27T18:03Z,"V - 7
A - 3

Had to plug in my headphones and turn the volume way up just to hear anything. "
,pwnt_soup,2013-04-27T19:03Z,is this the same copy with really bad audio that you cant hear at all? I downloaded 3 copys today and all are the same unwatchable copy with size between 1.2 and 1.4 gb. thanks for the effort but its unwatchable unless you can read lips and are hard of hearing anyway.
,papayrus,2013-04-28T15:11Z,The video is good enough but the moron made all kinds of background noise over the already terrible audio recording. If this is really how your camera records audio you should rma it. I have to turn the volume off just to watch it it makes it better. Thanks for the upload ghost I know it's free but you can't here it so whats the point.
