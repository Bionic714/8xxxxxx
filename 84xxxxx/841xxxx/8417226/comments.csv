Bad in that the audio is so low even with 400% noise amplification in ffdshow audio decoder it still has a lot of noise and even using a noise filter it just makes the audio harder to hear."

,Mrpell,2013-04-29T06:55Z,"@ProphetZarquon 

Pretty much right on the money about the audio. You could do a ton of audio tweaking and it won't do any good until someone actually does a proper cam rip in the USA on or after May 3rd."
