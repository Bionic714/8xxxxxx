First biography paragraph from All Music (by Richie Unterberger):

The Hondells were the recipient of the best song that Brian Wilson donated to another artist, "Little Honda." One of the best hot-rod tunes, it made the Top Ten in 1964 (the Beach Boys would record their own version that year, but would not issue it as an A-side). Like numerous Southern California groups in the mid-'60s, the Hondells, despite numerous picture sleeves, were not a bonafide group. Their recordings were put together by floating lineups of Los Angeles session men, overseen by producer Gary Usher. "Little Honda" itself featured ace guitarists Glen Campbell and Richie Podolor, as well as drummer Hal Blaine. Hondells groups were put together for live performance in the wake of "Little Honda," but session musicians such as Podolor were always present on the recordings.

All Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):

The Hondells may be a marginal group, but if you're going to take the plunge for an entire album's worth of material, it would be hard to imagine a better value than this compilation. A whopping 36 songs are crammed into one disc of 1964-66 recordings, including everything from their first two albums and early singles. It's somewhat samey-sounding, but still a half-decent facsimile of the Jan & Dean/Beach Boys sound circa 1964. Three hot, brooding surf instrumentals penned by Richie Podolor sound out of place, yet at the same time are about the best tracks here besides "Little Honda."
