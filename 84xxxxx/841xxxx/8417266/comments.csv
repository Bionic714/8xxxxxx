,vidwyz,2013-04-27T18:43Z,Thanks a bunch
,platinumkid,2013-04-27T21:22Z,Thanks for the uploads! Just 1 remark - please don't put all the games of the series together. If someone wants the old ones he/she can just scroll down the list and find them. Cheers
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-27T22:45Z,BEFORE U DOW THIS THE PLAY OFF ARE OVER PURE CRAP´.
,capo1,2013-04-27T23:09Z,Hey Nepotu any chance you could put single playoff games up in 540p.
[V],Nepotu,2013-04-27T23:36Z,"I can't do that, because is the ripper`s call. You can select any game you want from your client list. I think you know how to do rhat.
@Tweety: It's not a crap. If the playoffs are over until you figure it out how to DL a single game from a list it's not my fault and don't means that is a crap. Think before you talk, or don't talk craps!"
,plopper11,2013-04-27T23:39Z,"While I appreciate the torrent, WTF is with the entire 3 games in one? Idiotic."
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-28T04:18Z,the point being is u have 2 seeders when u have all this games in one DL but when u have only one game increase the seeders. And tht is not crap Nep.
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-28T04:19Z,"but of course i didn't mean bad with my commts i just choose the wrong word for what i wanted say
my bad."
,mickeykau,2013-04-28T05:22Z,Thank you for uploads. Please ignore these guys who don't understand how torrents work and continue to upload.
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-28T06:12Z,oh gosh there we have a Pepsi tht thinks he is a coca.
,mickeykau,2013-04-28T06:56Z,"The no of seeders is not relevant to these files. The definition of a seeder is one who has all 3 files - in this case, not many will download all 3. However, there are still plenty of people who have downloaded the latest game - therefore, the speed of the download will not be affected just because it shows a few seeders. The only inconvenience is that you don't really know exactly how many people are true seeders, but it's a very minor inconveniance. Keep up good work Nepotu."
,TWEETY2455,2013-04-28T07:43Z,"Really?then explain why the up with one game i finished in 35 minuts,and this witch i choose the game i want is taking me hours ?"
,mickeykau,2013-04-28T08:30Z,"There are many factors involved:
1. The size of the file - perhaps you downloaded a smaller 540p file before (3 times smaller)
2. The connection speed of peers connected at the time- 1 peer with a great speed is more important than 100 with low speeds.
3. Also, make sure you did select the correct file to download in your Torrent client. If you selected the earlier file, not the latest you would have a problem."
