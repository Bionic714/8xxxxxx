Book Description

Next time you party, try a dip. Or two. Or three. Rick Rodgers, renowned cooking teacher and cookbook author shares 95 of his favorite dip recipes in his new book, Dip It!
Of course there's the classic onion soup mix, but why not make Rick's updated recipe with onions? For a Super Bowl or tailgating party, you'll score big with bowls of tortilla chips served up with meaty Hot Beef and Pinto Bean Chili Dip.
There are plenty of vegetarian spreads, too. Scoop wedges of pita into Moroccan Eggplant and Tomato Dip. The Faux Cheese Fondue will be a hit with cheese lovers. Rick also offers plenty of lighter dips such as the Two-Alarm Salsa or Three-Bean Salsa. Need an elegant dip for a special occasion?
Try the Pesto Mascarpone or the silky smooth Double Salmon Dip. And many of these dips do double duty-use them to bring a little something extra to your sandwiches.
And what's homemade dip without crunchy, crispy dippers? There are recipes for homemade versions of Potato Chips, Herbed Breadsticks, Tortilla Chips, and much more. Also included is a complete list of vegetable dippers that will add snap and color to your table.
Rick also offers lots of helpful entertaining tips from do-ahead recipes to creative dip holders.

So have a party. Take a dip with Dip It!
