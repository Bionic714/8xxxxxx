Arts Documentary hosted by Samuel West, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

A film that looks at revered British artist JMW Turner in a new light, exploring how there is more to Turner than his sublime landscapes, he also painted machines, science, technology and industry. The programme examines nine key Turner paintings and shows how we should re- think them in the light of the scientific and Industrial Revolution. Turner's life spanned the Industrial Revolution, he witnessed it as it unfolded and he painted it, and in the process created a whole new kind of art. Includes interviews with historian Simon Schama and artist Tracey Emin.
