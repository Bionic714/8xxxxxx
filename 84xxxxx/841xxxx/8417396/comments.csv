Other releases have even worse audio then this when it sounds like the whole movie was recorded in an echo chamber, lots of background noise, and even with ampflication it's still very hard to make out all the audio."

@Mrpell, You commented on several Iron man 3 uploads, and all your comments sound the same. I suggest you stick the easily recognized form of feedback.

@Mrpell, You comment more than most TPB users(usually to our appreciation). Also, all your Iron man 3 comments sound the same. Try the classic A:/V:/M: format once in while and save us the redundancy"
,Mrpell,2013-05-04T07:40Z,Now who's stuck? You didn't have to tell me twice to try and stick to the A: V: M: format just saying. :)
