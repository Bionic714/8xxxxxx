,pwnt_soup,2013-04-27T19:04Z,is this the same copy with really bad audio that you cant hear at all? I downloaded 3 copys today and all are the same unwatchable copy with size between 1.2 and 1.4 gb. thanks for the effort but its unwatchable unless you can read lips and are hard of hearing anyway.

Bad in that the audio is so low even with 400% noise amplification in ffdshow audio decoder it still has a lot of noise and even using a noise filter it just makes the audio harder to hear."
