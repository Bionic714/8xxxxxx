What's cool about it:
A thrilling storyline designed by a professional writer - Roberta Williams
One of the first games utilizing full-motion video technology so well
See for yourself what caused so much controversy around this game!
Overview:
I feel its presence, the icy fingers upon my throat. 
I hear its eerie sounds, unsettling my every thought. 
I try in vain to slumber, my reveries gripped by violent terror. My only salvation, the shock of awakening. 
Something is very, very wrong here. 

Master storyteller Roberta Williams challenges you to experience the ultimate interactive nightmare.
