Portable version of VMware Player.

It comes with 3 executables:
  # VMware Player Portable (run).exe: Makes all changes needed to run VMware Player Portable, then run it.
  # VMware Player Portable (clean).exe: Reverts all changes made on the computer by the first executable.
  # VMware Player Portable (run & clean).exe: Makes all changes needed to run VMware Player Portable, then run it and clean everything up when VMware Player is closed.

The last executable is the most portable of the three, but the first one is faster on subsequent runs.

All of the three executables need administrator permissions to run.

To update VMware Player Portable, just put the installer of the newer version on the Update folder, and it will update itself the next time it runs.
