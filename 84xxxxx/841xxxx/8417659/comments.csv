Do I still extract your version over it or create a separate steam folder?"

message"" both connected to internet and not connected..any help appreciated"
,Mercyflush64,2013-04-29T16:07Z,Same thing. In offline mode it asks to login to steam.
,csslouis,2013-04-30T14:00Z,did what you suggested stormbahn99 but it didnt help...if i reboot i can start the game but as soon as i restart the game after changing graphics settings i get the login message...am running win7 x64
,filmtwilight,2013-05-01T14:50Z,"if have message ""please log in to steam"" you must delete all steam cracked folder if you have TS2013 in other version ! like v.25.1b delete this and re extract/reinstall again :D"
,big_rabbit,2013-05-03T22:56Z,"I'm in the same brown spot as  'csslouis'. 'filmtwighlight' could you please elaborate, on how you fixed this. I deleted the contents of the Steam folder and re-extrated the Steam file again. This worked fine the the first time, then it's back to the 'Log into Steam'."
,filmtwilight,2013-05-04T07:44Z,i sometimes work and sometimes not work.. 
,csslouis,2013-05-05T08:15Z,basically this is an imperfect crack...thanx for your efforts but hopefully a better crack comes along...frustrating to play the way it is
,filmtwilight,2013-05-07T04:49Z,"ok now work, you must create news Account and password steam again."
