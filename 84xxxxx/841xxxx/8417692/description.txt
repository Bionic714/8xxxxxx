Prager 20130426  03 Open Lines

Prager H3: Per usual, callers set the agenda. Issues raised include:
 should a parent save for their childΓÇÖs college education;
 why doesnΓÇÖt Dennis move to Texas;
 what is the difference between racism and prejudice.


Prager 20130426  02 Happiness Hour: Obstacle to Gratitude

Prager H2: Gratitude is the key to the happiness.
 But thereΓÇÖs a big obstacle to gratitude ... short memory.
 Does gratitude have a memory problem?


Prager 20130426  01 Clam Up

Prager H1: The surviving terror brother clammed up as soon as a Federal judge read him his Miranda rights.
 What was the rush?
 In one of his more foolish statements, 
 Chris Matthew says we have to ΓÇ£stop killing Arabs on International TVΓÇ¥ 
 as if we do it for sport
 The term ΓÇ£Master BedroomΓÇ¥ is disappearing. Apparently, itΓÇÖs racist and/or sexist.
