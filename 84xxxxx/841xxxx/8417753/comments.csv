thank u!!!!!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-27T22:27Z,"no problem! yeah when i finally saw a scan of #9 today, i thought ""TOOOORRRRRENT!"" lol"
,reneshakil,2013-04-27T22:58Z,lol
,binderguy1,2013-04-28T01:58Z,"Thanks for the updated ul!  I had been hoping for someone to ul the newer issues.  Funny how some series get more attention (like Crossed) and other series get overlooked for awhile.

While on the subject of Avatar, is there any chance of a Night of the Living Dead torrent?  There's several mini-series as well as different ""Living Dead"" titles."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-28T03:46Z,"i think it's because avatar's best sellers are usually crossed. i've copy-and-pasted some numbers -- the avatar comics from the diamond top 300 for february and march, and copies sold:

CROSSED BADLANDS #25 (MR) 12,022
CROSSED BADLANDS #26 (MR) 8,326
CROSSED ANNUAL 2013 #1 (MR) 7,613
CROSSED BADLANDS #23 (MR) 7,543
CROSSED BADLANDS #24 (MR) 7,279
FASHION BEAST #7 (MR) 5,435
FASHION BEAST #6 (MR) 5,328
FERALS #13 (MR) 4,653
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD AFTERMATH #4 (MR)	4,265
NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD AFTERMATH #5 (MR)	4,083

i've only seen ""aftermath"" #1-3 scanned so far. they were scanned by Danger from Empire, so maybe he/she will read this."
,Calel1234,2013-04-28T04:23Z,"I was wondering what happened to Stitched. After issue 6 or 7, it seemed pretty final since the battle was done. Glad there's more and thanks for the upload.

Those numbers on Crossed are pretty good or at least comparatively to the other Avatar ones. Do you know what happened to Fashion Beast? Seems like last issue was uploaded 2 months ago."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-28T05:09Z,"yeah the ""ennis bump"" worked out well for them, that is if they aren't paying him so much that he wipes out the gain!  :-)  they did a good job promoting his return, i think.

honestly about fashion beast, i posted #6 and nobody said thanks, so i've passed over the last 2 scans. almost certain i saw them on magazine3k.com . i'd torrent them but i've got to sleep!"
,tdurden83,2013-04-28T05:55Z,"aw man, I hope those numbers don't mean dan the unharmable is in danger of being canned"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-04-28T15:25Z,"Thanks man. What a pleasant surprise to wake up to. The way 7 ended, I had assumed the series had concluded and never checked. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-28T16:49Z,"does avatar sell any/all of its titles digitally? i dunno. the above are just u.s. comic shop orders and don't include digital sales. 

dan the unharmable #12 is the final issue. it's supposed to come out wednesday. sorry tdurden83! maybe they'll bring it back for another volume..."
,tdurden83,2013-04-28T20:34Z,"i'll try to be more like dan and not let that bother me, but that'd be great if they do bring it back. it was pretty out there, I dug it. Avatar should worry less about making so many variant covers, and just focus on making more DtU, lol "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T01:31Z,"i thought it was great, too. you guys got me into that one, i never tried it until i saw comments about it being good!"
