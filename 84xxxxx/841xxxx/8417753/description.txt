Garth Ennis created this story for Avatar, but Mike Wolfer (WIDOW, STRANGE KISS, LADY DEATH) does the script and art on the first storyline. Currently Wolfer is plotting and scripting, with art by Fernando Furakawa.

From the Volume 1 hardcover description:

Critically acclaimed graphic novelist Garth Ennis and Mike Wolfer unleash an all-new kind of horror as they rip the horrors of war right from today's headlines and thrust it beyond the boundaries of sanity. Three American soldiers, the survivors of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, struggle across the Taliban-controlled mountains. Injured and lacking food, water, and medicine, they discover something far worse than enemy fighters among the sun-bleached rocks: an ancient supernatural power, murderous and unstoppable. Despite a timely rescue by a handful of British S.A.S. commandos, they're still hopelessly outnumbered by the shambling, ragged undead and the evil human intelligence that controls them.
