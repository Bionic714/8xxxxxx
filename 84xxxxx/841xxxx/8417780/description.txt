AS WE REMAIN 

Swedish Hardcore/Metalcore Founded in 2011
Check out our new EP: "Chapters & Choices"

As We Remain is a hardcore metal band formed in the year of 2011 from Västerås in Sweden, Influences stretch all the way from the original New York Hardcore scene to the Metalcore of today. The result is a more "straight forward" type of hardcore/metalcore with simple breakdowns, heavy riffing and a very harsh sound in general.

Most of the productions and recordings have been made by the band at no cost at all, which has resulted in the new EP: "Chapters & Choices" along with our music-video "One Of A Kind".
