,Harvey_P,2013-04-27T23:46Z,miamisunset - Who cares? I just want to know if this is a quality download.
,megoesmo0,2013-04-27T23:52Z,"Good torrent. A/V 10

The mixup with the Episodes is probably because usualy the christmas special is between seasons and therefore is not counted. This season, being dragged over 2 years, has a special in the middle of it that should be counted as a regular episode imo, but probably isn't."
,stremaxim,2013-04-27T23:56Z,It really is the 10th episode. get your facts straight. 
,OccamsRayzor,2013-04-28T00:00Z,I admit to finding it curious that the uploader has a history of only uploading porn.
,Harvey_P,2013-04-28T00:26Z,LOL @ OccamsRayzor
,Khoyo,2013-04-28T00:49Z,"No, see https://thepiratebay.sx/user/Drarbg/10/3"
,Violentos,2013-04-28T01:44Z,So... is this a good file or not?
,dBLOOD42,2013-04-28T05:32Z,"miamisunset No you idiot, the christmas one is a SPECIAL."
,bobstoy,2013-04-28T09:58Z,"More important, is this a COMPLETE episode from the very beggining to the very end of the credits? so far ive downloaded uncomplete ones that clock at 44mins 17sec.  "
,leggmann,2013-04-29T16:12Z,"For anyone who's been a Doctor Who fan for any amount of time, you's know that the 'Christmas Special' has never been counted as one of the numbered series episodes. If for some bizarre reason that they (BBC) decide to count this and number it as a regular series 7 episode, then that will be something completely new and different. And in the grand scheme of things it really doesn't matter anyway."
