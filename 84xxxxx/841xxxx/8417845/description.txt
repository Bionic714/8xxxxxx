'Pathetic Humanity' tells the story of human depravity and perversion. The record features mixed styles ranging from black metal to technical death, often filled with harmonics and even some doom metal elements. Two vocals together with two unique guitars tuned all the way down to C, all accompanied by brutal blast beats on drums, create an eerie, sometimes psychedelic, yet soothing atmosphere.
