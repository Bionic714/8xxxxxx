For fans of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You comes an erotic, emotionally charged romance between a powerful man whoΓÇÖs never heard ΓÇ£noΓÇ¥ and a fiery woman who says ΓÇ£yesΓÇ¥ on her own terms. 

He was the one man I couldnΓÇÖt avoid. And the one man I couldnΓÇÖt resist. 

Damien Stark could have his way with any woman. He was sexy, confident, and commanding: Anything he wanted, he got. And what he wanted was me.

Our attraction was unmistakable, almost beyond control, but as much as I ached to be his, I feared the pressures of his demands. Submitting to Damien meant I had to bare the darkest truth about my pastΓÇöand risk breaking us apart.

But Damien was haunted, too. And as our passion came to obsess us both, his secrets threatened to destroy himΓÇöand usΓÇöforever.

Release Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.
