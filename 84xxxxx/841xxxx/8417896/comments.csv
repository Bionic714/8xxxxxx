,BBQAPPLES,2013-05-08T04:11Z,When I play these episodes in Windows Media Player I have no audio. When playing in Media Player Classic everything works. But if I try to stream them from my computer to my Xbox all the episodes are now in Japanese.
,wrongfun1,2013-05-08T21:59Z,"this hdtv-raws is for pc with updated codecs.
I never had xbox but it seems english audio does not works because it is in ac3 format.
so you need to recode it in aac format as japan audio is."
