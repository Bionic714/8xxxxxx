A TV Dante, produced by BritainΓÇÖs Channel Four during the 1980s and aired in Britain in 1990, presents the first eight cantos of the Inferno. Great vhs/tv-rip quality.

Co-directed by Peter Greenaway and Tom Phillips. Greenaway is best known for such films as The DraughtsmanΓÇÖs Contract (1982), A Zed and Two Noughts (1985), The Belly of an Architect (1987), The Cook, the Thief, his Wife and her Lover (1989), and The Pillow Book (1996), Phillips, a composer, artist and critic, is perhaps best known for his interest in the art of the page. His 1983 translation of the Inferno is used for the production. (The rest of the Inferno has been divided among directors Raul Ruiz, Terry Gilliam, Zbig Ribzynski and Nagisa OshimaΓÇöVickers has worked with only the first eight cantos.)
The title of A TV Dante was clearly studied to put in play the high cultural register now evoked by the name ΓÇÿDanteΓÇÖ and the low cultural register evoked by TV.
