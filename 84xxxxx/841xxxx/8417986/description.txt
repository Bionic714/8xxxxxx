Doctor Who - 710 - Journey To The Centre Of The TARDIS

While on a voyage, the TARDIS is caught by an intergalactic salvage crew, and amidst the chaos Clara is lost in the depths of the TARDIS. The salvagers intend to sell it for scrap, but the Doctor threatens to destroy the TARDIS by putting it in lock down and activating the self destruct if the salvage crew doesn't help him find Clara. Meanwhile, something lurks in the dark halls of the TARDIS... and the Doctor is fully aware of it. But the question is, why does he keep it locked away...?
