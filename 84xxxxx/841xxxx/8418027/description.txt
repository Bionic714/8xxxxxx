About "One More Time"
"One More Time" is a song by Daft Punk first released as a single on 13 November 2000 and later included in the 2001 album Discovery.
 It is a French house song, notable for its vocal performance by Romanthony which is heavily auto-tuned and compressed. As part of the 
album, the animated promo video forms part of the later released film, Interstella 5555. "One More Time" remains Daft Punk's biggest 
commercial hit to date. It nearly topped the United Kingdom chart in 2000, instead peaking at #2, and was one of their 
few charting songs in the United States, reaching #61 on the Billboard Hot 100.The song is listed at #5 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 
songs of the 2000s,and #33 on Rolling Stone's top 100 songs of the decade (2000-2009) as well as #307 on Rolling Stone's amended 
"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list in May 2010. It was voted by Mixmag readers as the greatest dance record of all time
