Sometimes all you need is Patience.

LifeΓÇÖs been hard for Zeke. Being a punching bag for his alcoholic father has turned him into stone. Not even the dodgy trailer park he lives in can scare him. Fighting is his release and sex, drugs, and his guitar bring him peace, but deep down Zeke isnΓÇÖt quite as hard as he makes himself out to be. When he meets Patience, she finds all his broken pieces and puts him back together, but sheΓÇÖs a ray of light in his shadowed life and the last thing he wants to do is bring her into his dark world. Playing careless is easy, playing the bad guy can be fun, but playing Patience is impossible, especially when she can see right through him. 

Zeke isnΓÇÖt the only one whoΓÇÖs broken, and for the first time, in a long time, Patience feels alive. Her black and white world gets a shot of color when she meets Zeke. HeΓÇÖs unlike anyone sheΓÇÖs ever met with his tattoos, piercings, and blunt honesty. She wants nothing more than to let go and ride the wild side with him, but some wounds never heal and the broken pieces of Patience arenΓÇÖt so easy to find.
