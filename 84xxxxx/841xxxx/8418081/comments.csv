Or know of a link? Been trying to locate. X-Men Forever was phenomenal Thanks for bring that to the masses!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-27T23:34Z,"hidden years tpb #1 is in http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7973340/ -- i think there are some other marvel books in that one you'd enjoy, too. (marvel team-up by claremont & byrne?)

anyway that volume reprints #1-12.

i'm actually surprised 13-22 of hidden years is nowhere on TPB, unless i'm just not finding it. (one of the very unfortunate losses from the days of thepiratebay.sx were the x-men chronology torrents.) so that's probably near the top of my list..."
,marvelnerd76,2013-04-28T00:12Z,"appreciate it! Yeah, I'm really enjoying Byrne and Claremont more and more as I get older. I don't know if its nostalgia or what. "
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-04-28T16:47Z,"This is wonderful. Thanks STFmaryville! I hope someday we can find issues #2-#7.

Is there more Thomas Manson recoloring work available even on other titles? He does an incredible job!"
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-04-28T16:54Z,"Oh, by the way, if you happen to have the original ""Hawk and Dove"" (1988) miniseries by Karl/Barbara Kesel and Rob Liefeld, please upload it too! 

It's one of my guilty pleasures and unfortunately I've only found DC's New 52 issues on TPB.

Liefeld was such a promissing artist at the time, uh?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T01:27Z,"ggaanneesshhaa, thomas mason does a lot for marvel's collected editions. he has to recolor a lot of old marvels, like the ones in ""namor visionaries: john byrne, volume 1"". he also colored a run of 8 issues of the 2008-2010 ""cable"" series for marvel. here's an article about him. http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/07/22/check-out-pages-from-jim-lee-and-chris-claremonts-x-men-1-remastered-recolored-20th-anniversary-edition/  cool stuff! (i like both the original comics, and this newer, special effects style.)

i can find the hawk & dove miniseries, no problem.

marvelnerd76, i found the *other* hidden years issues, but i decided to collect all 22 into one torrent. should be posted before tuesday."
,alienoar,2013-04-29T02:42Z,@STFmaryville - I found this link for Hidden Years #13-19 amongst other titles... I didn't check to see if any of these are still valid links but might be worth looking into if you are trying to track these issues down. Thanks for all of the great uploads  http://softarchive.net/blogs/gfx4vn/x_men_the_hidden_years.155601.html
,alienoar,2013-04-29T02:43Z,"Never mind, those look like they are all old broken links"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T04:27Z,"thanks alienoar, i appreciate it anyway. i had actually found them on http://bolt.cd/board/f234/ and the series was in 2 .rar files. i grabbed one and hadn't had time to grab the other. thanks and always feel free to link in a comment if you find something."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T17:03Z,"marvelnerd76 and alienoar, here are the hidden years:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8422861/

i put the trade in there, too. of course no one has to download the trade, just use your torrent client software's option to ""uncheck"" that file. alternatively, you might d/l the trade and #13-22 to get the whole story..."
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-05-07T02:40Z,"I managed to have a copy of the Mutant Genesis 2.0 in my hands yesterday and it took my breath away. The only reason why I didn't buy it despite being expensive was because the cover was a little torn and if I'm buying full price for a book it must be perfect. Anyway one of the thing that caught my attention was that in the very beggining of the book was a mention to Shatterstar and the Mojoverse, but there was no sign of this characters in the book since it only includes adjectiveless X-Men #1-7. WTF?!? Did Marvel change its mind after editing this edition? I think issues #8-11 were supposed to be there too, but for some reason it just isn't..."
