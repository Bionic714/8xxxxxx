So many other posts of this film are kind of weird...

I'm DYING to know exactly what you did.  I'm ASSUMING that you took an HD broadcast and paired it maybe with DVD Audio to get better quality.

Am I close...?  : )

Thanks so much!!!

Cheers!"

BUT... I'm just really curious... If this IS an HD broadcast then why the super high file size?

Hope you don't mind my asking...

THANKS!!!"
