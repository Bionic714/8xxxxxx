thanx"
[T],pobban2,2013-05-02T12:27Z,"Im tired of going trough all movies to avoid anything from YIFY. Because Im a film fan, and films should have good at least 5.1 sound. SO I wish this sucker starts to upload movies that could be enjoyed also with good sound, so I dont have to jump over everything marked YIFI. Its sad that this guy is the most popular uploader. Its Sad people doesnt care about good sound."

@pobban & phuckstic
i love the variety of downloads that exist, i dont have a freakin 5.1 dolby digital sound fucken system nor do i even have a good internet connection, i steal wifi from a linksys account, which works better than my lame at&t connection. Stop hating on the lower quality uploads they are in high demand for a reason"
