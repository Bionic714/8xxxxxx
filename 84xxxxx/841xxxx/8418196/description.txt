Nature Documentary hosted by Chris Morgan, published by PBS broadcasted as part of PBS Nature series in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Meet the mob of street smart kangaroos moving into Australia's capital city and the ecologists following their every move. Over the course of one drought-stricken year we follow mob leader, Black Spot, and kangaroo mother, Madge, with her two young joeys - mischievous Sonny and tiny pouch-bound Alice. Here is a look at what happens when human development encroaches on wildlife habitat and two very different species are forced to co-exist.
