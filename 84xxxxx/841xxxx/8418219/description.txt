New album Raven (April 23, 675 Records) marks a few important milestones for Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Paula Cole. After years in the major label domain and five prior studio releases, Cole steps truly solo and independent with Raven: raising fan-funds through Kickstarter, assembling a studio band and producing and writing her songs (with production assistance from friend and drummer Ben Wittman). It is, she says, an embrace of "the new entrepreneurial reality" as well as an inpressive bounty of "highly personal" new songs. Raven also marks the 20th anniversary of her invitation to sing on Peter Gabriel's 1993 Secret World tour and the recording of her first album Harbinger. From her earliest work through her big mid-90's hits -- "I Don't Want to Wait" and "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone" and to the present, Cole has always displayed a deft hand with the dramatic, the socially-aware and the heartfelt soul-searching, infusing her distinctive melodies with lyrical heft. Album opener "Life Goes On" speaks volumes on where Cole is right at this moment -- and reaffirms what makes her gifts so special.
