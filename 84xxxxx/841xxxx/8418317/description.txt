Our next FCUP series is 'Mars'. Wikipedia, him say:

Mars is a 1984 American comic book series published by First Comics that ran for 12 issues. Inspired by the pulp science fiction stories of the 1930s and 1940s, creators Mark Wheatley and Marc Hempel collaborated on the story featuring a group of explorers and engineers sent to Mars with the goal of terraforming the red planet. When all communication with earth is lost, the team of terraformers must make a decision that will not only forever change their lives but perhaps the future of the human race. 'Mars' is also notable for the introduction of 'Dynamo Joe', which ran as a back-up feature in several issues.

Please note that the last page of issue #9, a text piece, is unreadable. It's unfortunate but it doesn't affect the main story. If anyone has a corrected scan, feel free to upload it.

Also, I'd like to point out that each of my First Comics uploads contains a .txt file called 'First Missing'. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!

Shout-out to the creative teams and the scanners! Seed, baby, seed!
