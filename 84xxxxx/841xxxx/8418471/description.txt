This is 3rd movie with that buff female body builder (Sue Price) running around, but this time she is in some place in Europe.  She is like the female Arnold.  Decent low budget movie.

As someone else stated on the IMDB boards, this doesn't appear to really be a sequel to the Nemesis series.  It seems as though they started with another movie in mind, but then switched it to Nemesis for some reason.

It does feature Sue Price a lot and she didn't even get top billing on IMDB.  Sue is present in about 99% of all the shots and she is naked or near naked in 100% of them.  Another thing that suggest this wasn't really suppose to be Nemesis 4 is some of the scenes in this film make Alex (Sue Price) have "extra's" that weren't even alluded to in the first film.  You'll know them when you see them... Hint:  Total Recall 3 Tit scene and no she doesn't have 3 tits.
