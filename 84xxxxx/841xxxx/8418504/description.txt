Anime music collection, hand picked by me and updated monthly with only the best anime music both new and old.




Previous months inclueded in torrent file, but if you've got them already just untick the folders you don't want in your torrent downloader, if it doesnt ask you what folders to download, go to preferences &gt; UI settings &gt; and tick the "show a window that displays the files inside the torrent" then delete and re-add the torrent, or you could just go down to the files tab and choose the "don't download" option :)
