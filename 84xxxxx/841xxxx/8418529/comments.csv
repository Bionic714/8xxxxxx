,lapis22,2013-04-28T01:53Z,whats the point of continuing to upload an unwatchable copy? 
,mugsyny65,2013-04-28T01:59Z,is it watchable
,bigrg23,2013-04-28T02:13Z,THIS IS GOOD COPY!WEEK BEFORE IT COMES OUT!WHY R U BITCHING BOUT FREE COPY OF VERY WATCHABLE COPY?EVERYTHING CANT BE PERFECT!WE WISH IT WAS!TAKE OR KICK ROCKS!
,lapis22,2013-04-28T02:26Z,@bigrg23  it IS NOT very watchable unless you consider a movie with completely unintelligible audio very watchable. Also there are already a bunch of ups of this same file all with unintelligible audio. there is no reason for this upload.
,blackwhitto,2013-04-28T03:26Z,Is this one in English????
,lapis22,2013-04-28T05:59Z,it doesnt matter if its in english as you cant hear any of the dialog
,pwnt_soup,2013-04-28T06:31Z,"this is a great copy if your deaf and can read lips, if not then not so much"
,EnemyDrone,2013-04-28T07:04Z,"Video is ok about 4.5 audio is completely trash though. Would on DL if you are desperate to see this. 

V/4.5
A/2"
,jonno1313,2013-04-28T17:47Z,"V-7
a-3"
,jonno1313,2013-04-28T18:22Z,its watchable and if you are close to your speakers then its hearable aswell.relax guys turn up the volume and then its pretty okey copy... or you can just wait for a better copy.
,lapis22,2013-04-28T18:34Z,@jonno1313  youre insane
,lapis22,2013-04-28T18:42Z,"also whats wrong with warning people about what theyer getting? which is what the uploader shouldve done.  its not a matter of volume, you can turn youre speaker all the way up and duct tape them to your head you still cant understand most of the dialog as it is so muffled.  I find it strange that people are deffending the audio on this.  you know some people have download limits per month? this would be a total waste of their bandwidth.  I would expect some1 with a skull to be honest and up front with the info about what they are offering."
,arros,2013-04-28T20:56Z,is there a script
,bawbzor,2013-04-29T23:04Z,All these scene groups re-release the same copy and slap their names on it.
