Company of Heroes is an entertaining WWII movie. Nothing about the movie will jump out at you, but even though the acting, directing and script are all average--it still is a good film to watch.

Is this movie a historical view of WWII? No. The movie is based on a video game and not on the actual events that happened during the war. Why people are bashing it on that basis confuses me because the same folks liked Inglorious Bastards which is a far fetched fantasy movie with absolutely less accuracy than Company of Heroes. Personally I prefer this movie over the foul mouthed Inglorious Bastards because you have more likable characters and a few who are actually rounded out to create a connection to them.

Tom Sizemore is good in this movie. He raises it above what it would have been with a lesser actor in the role and he makes the rest of the cast serviceable.

Entertaining for entertainment purposes and not for a history lesson.
