From the Pacific Northwest to the shores of the Atlantic seaboard, the breadth and scope of America is like no other place on Earth. The land we see today was shaped over hundreds of millions of years. Guided by leading geoscientists, and with the aid of dramatic special effects and animations, we unravel the mysteries of continent-building and the almost unimaginable span of geologic time. Using high tech science tools and even Ultralight aircraft, viewers will travel with geoscientists as we discover America's prominent geologic features and how they formed. Narrated By Maurice Lamarche"
