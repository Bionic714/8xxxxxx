,ChingaTuu,2013-04-28T22:56Z,"...Hey Mothra, any chance you can up the seed rate just a little? I'd like to seed this for at least three days before I have to do some drive juggling between the download box and the websurfing box - got a drive on the latter acting flakey, and I need to pop it over to the download box where I can use this debugger controller to kick the daughterboard BIOS in the cunt - it *is* a daughterboard, mind you - and make it quit claiming the drive's about to fail when it's not. Seagate drives will do that as part of planned obsolecence, natch!

FYI, I've also gotten a request from a modeling buddy of mine who wants all the ""War Wheel"" appearances when I finish downloading them. He wants to build a 1/96 or 1/144 diorama featuring a collumn of Nazi War Wheels going against a rework of an old Aurora kitbash he did almost 50 years ago, where he took three of the ""Anzio"" beachhead kits, and at least two of the ""Rat Patrol"" kits - both of which were featured on the back covers of comics in the late 60s when American Seeds didn't pay their ad bills that month :P - and he wants to scratch build at least three variants of the Wheels. I've already sent him my scans of the Evanier/Spiegle ""Blackhawk"" run from the 90's, but there were like two or three variants, including the original one that he wants to look at.

Who says piracy doesn't promote the hobby? Or another hobby altogether, for that matter? :)"
,Mothra67,2013-04-28T23:15Z,"you're welcome, enjoy and seed everyone!  :)"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-01T20:07Z,"...Otay, I finished my 48-hours of seeding. Hope everyone got the parts they needed, and whatever you kids do, *SEED*. Mothra posted one hell of a Blackhawk collection, and even if you're a treehugging, pothead, peacenik, commie, hippie radical pervert, you'll *love* these classics. Especially the War Wheel stories, which I now have to copy off and send to a friend as noted elsewhere on this page so he can get started on his diorama.

Mothra, not to kiss yer ass, but I do thank you again for posting this. It's pirates like you that keep some semblance of honesty amongst us thieves :) :) :) :) :) :P"
,Mothra67,2013-05-02T06:54Z,"I am truly thankful you all appreciate these classics, but I must be honest, all the Golden Age comics I have posted are in the public domain, so no piracy here, sorry to disappoint!  ;P  I just wanna give back to a cool community, and almost all the stuff I share most modern comics readers never even heard of, so it's good they learn where it all started.....

about this torrent, I have kept it seeding for 4 days, way longer than I should have considering my bandwidth, so it is up to the rest of the seeders to keep it going!"
