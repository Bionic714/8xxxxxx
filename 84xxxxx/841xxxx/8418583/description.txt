His origin?

Blackhawk was an ace pilot from Poland. After Nazis bombed the peaceful farm that his family lived on, in the opening days of World War II, killing everyone he loved, Blackhawk vowed to battle tyranny. He assembled an international team of ace fighter pilots to assist him.

Blackhawk and his men were ace pilots, flying customized fighter planes, Grumman XF5F Skyrocket. They usually carried handguns and operated off of a remote and heavily fortified island in the Atlantic Ocean. Blackhawk himself was a brilliant leader and tactician. He was also good with his fists.

In Hit Comics #26, Blackhawk was summoned by Kid Eternity from Blackhawk's own comic, Military Comics, to combat Dr. Pain who the aviator kills in battle. 

His enemies included fantastic devices such as the Iron Emperor and the War Wheel as well as modern day evil doers named after Mordred, Genghis Khan, and Blackbeard.
