"Discover inexplicable incidents occurring not only in the skies and the cosmos, but also in the natural world, and at the depths of human mind with the help of hoaxes, technologies, secret societies and miracles. 

This book steals the show as like other mystery books it just doesn't help you imagine situations or invented characters but also allows you to revolve around real happenings which though are hard to believe due to their extraordinary nature but the illustrations and proofs provided in the book convinces the reader of their existence and hence keeps him glued.

Though it is not a fiction, the incidences mentioned in this book are exceptionally and completely breathtaking which promise to make the reader more and more curious with every passing leaf..."
