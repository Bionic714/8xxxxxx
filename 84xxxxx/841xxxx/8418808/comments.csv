,Coconut.Craze,2013-04-28T04:10Z,Can you please upload all the London Horror Comic issues .
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-28T05:11Z,"sorry, but i don't have any of those. i'd never even heard of the series until reading your comment."
,bgg1175,2013-04-28T06:23Z,"Anyone seen the TPB of the ""Saga Of The Super-Sons""? Or TPBs of the original ""World's Finest""? 
That stuff was more cool than any recent versions. "
,Coconut.Craze,2013-04-28T11:18Z,"k no problem stf , can you please upload the series, The Unwritten . "
,Ahlat,2013-04-28T17:34Z,Thanks a lot for this STFmaryville! If it's not too much trouble could you please also upload Tiny Titans?
,dbranson17,2013-04-28T20:03Z,"Thanks, I use these in my tutoring - I just wish there were more female characters.

I have a request.  If you or anyone else reading this has any of the I CAN READ books with Marvel characters I could really use that...  A lot of the more challenging readers have caught on and have begun objecting with, ""oh, you're just going to MAKE me read Superman again!""

*shudder*

thanks."
,dbranson17,2013-04-28T20:08Z,"BTW, the I CAN READ books have controlled vocabulary so that a readers level can be matched to a book that maximizes their success in reading and then discussing the book which is much more useful than books aimed at young readers through styling and story content.

It's surprising, but not very productive, when a first grade boy can read Imperial Senate and Rebel Alliance, but can't make sense of throw(n) or wait..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T01:10Z,"i will keep an eye out for those I Can Reads, unfortunately comic scanners aren't well-known for the licensed young reader books.

i do know of some other all-ages comics that could be helpful, though...

tiny titans, sure but i hope i can find them all... by the way, i'm pleased to hear that art and franco are leaving dc for new projects at dark horse and thrillbent!

unwritten, sure whenever i have time this week...

super-sons and world's finest trades, haven't seen them scanned yet... good stuff, though...

if anybody's wondering, i've still been compiling x-men classic as the weekend is ending."
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-04-29T15:25Z,"Thanks -

 Hey, is there a link for Night of the Living Dead Aftermath I'm not noticing? I looked up the first three issues but didn't see a torrent after that. Thought i might have missed it.

[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T16:24Z,"no my friend, i've no doubt it was my fault as i'm sometimes unclear. what i meant to write was that i've seen the scans of #1-3 on magazine3k.com but haven't downloaded or posted them here!"
,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-04-29T17:09Z,"Good deal, I've got the first 3 myself and will put them up. Hopefully the others will come online soon, its been pretty good thusfar. "
