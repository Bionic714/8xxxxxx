[T],penfag,2013-04-28T16:08Z,"Thank you for this!  ""Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper"" (2001) is an especially valuable addition.  The book follows Baker's attempt to uncover the fate of thousands of books and newspapers that were replaced and often destroyed during the microfilming boom of the 1980s and 1990s.  It generated enormous controversy among librarians and is a must-read for anyone who loves books and newspapers.
