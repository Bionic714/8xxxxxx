Wish for Wings are a metalcore band from Brisbane, Australia.[1]

In 2003, they released a four-track demo[2] titled xDEMOx recorded with Adam Merker at Studio Andeers Deebers and distributed through local record shops. However, word quickly spread of the bands energetic live shows and stage presence and ticket sales soon eclipsed sales of the demo.[citation needed]

In 2005, the band recorded and released their debut EP, From the Past to the Grave through Washed Up Records[3] which reached No. 10 on the AIR Independent singles chart.[4] The band then toured Australia, New Zealand and Canada in support of the release.[5]

Wish for Wings released their debut album, Afterlife in November, 2008.
