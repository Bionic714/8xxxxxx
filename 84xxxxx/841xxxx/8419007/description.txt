"This week on Money Talks we find some icy hot contestants, a pole dancer on Venice Beach, burn some toe and armpit hairs at the mall, and run into a downtown girl willing to show us her stuff. Then it gets really hot when we go eat at Chilis and take our waitress Kayla and Molly for another hot Money Talks joy ride!"
