because BBC2HD screwed up last night. 

They felt was it more important to keep showing a crappy snooker game which went waaaayyyy overtime.

And that decision caused them to cancel
QIXL and delay part three of the US television
documentary.

I stayed up late to make sure I could record it, and I did, but someone at the beeb wasn't on the ball.
They probably fell asleep, as I did a couple
of times during the boring snooker, almost missing
the start of this program.

There are 2 instances during the broadcast
that have no audio, for a total of a whopping 16 minutes!

So I won't be sharing this part 3 - so I don't
upset the crybaby trolls who like to complain about
free stuff. I don't want to be blamed for their
diaper rashes.

Part 3 is not scheduled to be re-aired.

BLAME THE BBC - NOT ME."
