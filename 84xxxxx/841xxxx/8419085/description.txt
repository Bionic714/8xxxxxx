The Misfit
Episode 2 of 4

Alan Yentob presents the second film in a star-studded series
that explores the social history of America through the prism
of primetime television. When America sits down to watch
primetime television it expects to see more than stereotypes
and stock characters going through the motions. Primetime
viewers want to see the United States of Television - in all
its individuality, diversity, eccentricity and quirkiness.

That's how some of the most high-risk characters in the primetime
crowd are born. These are the awkward squad - the ones who can't,
or won't, or aren't allowed to fit in: nerds, geeks, freaks,
rebels, outsiders and misfits. Characters like Gomez Addams in
The Addams Family, Louie DePalma in Taxi, George Costanza in
Seinfeld and practically the whole cast of Glee. But though they
may march to a different drummer, in primetime they become 'one
of us' - and we, whether we like it not, become one of them.

Featuring interviews with stars, creators, writers and producers
including Judd Apatow (Freaks and Geeks), Danny DeVito (Taxi),
Garry Shandling (The Larry Sanders Show), Jason Alexander (Seinfeld)
and the crown-prince of misfits, Larry David.
