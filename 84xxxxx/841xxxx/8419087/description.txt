"This week on money talks we continue on our road trip where we find two unsuspecting ladies at the gas pump. Havoc has these girls baring their goods in the freezing cold. Next we are back in Tallahassee where a couple chug Havocs nasty concoction. We head on over to New Orleans where we find someone willing to give us a private show in the bathroom. Also in New Orleans we get this really hot babe to do some jumping jacks for us Money Talks style, topless. For the main event our crew takes over a recording studio where they have some aspiring singers do what it takes for the mighty dollar. We have our participants eating out of garbage as well as playing the drum with their dicks. Lastly Jmac finds one participant who is willing to do what it takes to get a singing contract. We have our soon to be star play Jmacs flute as well as have her show us how an aspiring star rides the cock."
