"This week on Money Talks we pay tribute to our forefathers with a 4th of July extravaganza. In this episode we find 9 red blooded Americans to participate in games both patriotic and erotic. Our Oil Wrestling showdown features babes in body paint representing the U.S. and Britain. Tug of War is given a modern update, with anal beads instead of rope, asses instead of arms. While youre waving your freak flag high, dont miss a minute of Fire in the Hole, an extreme stunt involving a girl, a Roman Candle and countless explosions of cumfetti. For the finale, we end the episode with a proper bang, our local studs find ladies who want to celebrate their independence...the American way. Support our spoofs, and make love, not war."
