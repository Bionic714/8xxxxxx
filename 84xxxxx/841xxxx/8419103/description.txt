"Here we go again with yet another action packed episode of Money Talks. As you all know we like to add our own special touch to everyday mundane activities, and today is no exception. This time around we built a toilet seat made of plexi glass and sat a couple of hotties on it, the results were vagtastic. Then we take a walk down the beach and get some silly ass dude to perform an ATM on himself with a chap stick, unfortunately we forgot to mention that the chap stick had tingly menthol in it. After that we cook up a little bit called Money Honeys, where we mix a couple of babes, a couple bottles of honey and a whole lot of money. And for this updates big finish, the Money Talks crew hits the beach for a little Babe Watch, lets just say we finally see how C.J. passes the time in the life guard stand."
