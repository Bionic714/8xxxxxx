"Today on Money Talks we are kicking off the episode with a world record attempt of epic proportions. While the record for most tshirts worn is a typical record to attempt to break, we wanted to attempt a sexier record... most underwear worn, and just to take it up a notch we want whatever hottie we find to attempt it topless. After that, we stop at a little Diner from around the way, and wreak some serious havoc. We were getting people in the Diner to do all sorts of stupid shit, by closing time we started throwing around a bunch of cash and shit got real heavy. We got paid one couple to give our cameras an amazing sexy blow job demonstration. Then we convinced the waitress to join in the action by offering a whole lot of green just to fuck our boy on camera. Shit we even paid the Diner manager to let us fuck right there in the middle of the restaurant. Bon appetit."
