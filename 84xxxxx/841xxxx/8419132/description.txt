Nicholson Baker - The Mezzanine (Vintage, 1988).

The source file is rtf, not retail; appears to be a meticulous, high-quality, proofed version. I made a few changes to the formatting but otherwise didn't touch the text, then produced the epub and mobi files.


description:

In his startling, witty, and inexhaustibly inventive first novel, the author of Vox and The Fermata uses a one-story escalator ride as the occasion for a dazzling reappraisal of everyday objects and rituals. From the humble milk carton to the act of tying oneΓÇÖs shoes, The Mezzanine at once defamiliarizes the familiar world and endows it with loopy and euphoric poetry. Nicholson BakerΓÇÖs accounts of the ordinary become extraordinary through his sharp storytelling and his unconventional, conversational style. At first glance, The Mezzanine appears to be a book about nothing. In reality, it is a brilliant celebration of things, simultaneously demonstrating the value of reflection and the importance of everyday human human experiences.
