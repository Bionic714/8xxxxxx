For the 12th Porch Song release, we go South. The four-night New YearΓÇÖs run in 1997 at the Fox Theatre not only ushered in 1998, it also gave us our first show of 1998ΓÇªand also the last show in the states before Widespread Panic took off to Australia and EuropeΓÇªto come back for some Panic in the Streets in April. 

The decision to spread the four Fox shows over five days was genius...Build up to New Years, take a night off on New YearΓÇÖs day to recover from the celebration, and then gather again on the 2nd to see what happens. 

Well, what happened was just another incredible Widespread Panic experience.
