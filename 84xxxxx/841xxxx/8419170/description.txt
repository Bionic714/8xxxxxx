Holodomor, Ukraine, XX century: Genocide Technology (12x .FLV)

Holodomor is Ukrainian for "Extermination by hunger", the cheapest, most painful, cruel, and among the most cowardly ways to commit genocide. Just ask the Africans.. *crickets*

 ..bbut what about the..

This film documents the Ukrainian terror famine of 1932-33, which caused the deaths of 7,000,000 people. Using interviews with survivors and scholars to supplement rare photographic evidence, it established that the terror famine was deliberately created by the Soviet Government as part of Stalin's decades-long effort to destroy the Ukrainian peasantry, who resisted the forced collectivization of their lands. Since it's original release, it has received many international awards (including an Academy Award nomination), and has been featured on William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" program on the PBS television network. A powerful film, Harvest of Despair provides rare insight into one of this century's least-known but most vicious genocides.

There were corpses everywhere, people were swollen, and in excruciating pain from starvation. People ate their dogs, any chaff they could find, and much, much worse. Carts went door-to-door, picking up first, all their food, and then later, deliberately murdered by starvation, peasants' corpses. This is but one legacy of totalitarian ideology: extreme greed, misanthropic psychotic sadism, and corruption at the highest levels. Some call it war.

"They began taking down the icons, and smashing them on the ground. The people wanted to go inside the church, but they didn't let them. They ruined everything, smashed everything in the church. And the people stood outside crying, because they couldn't do anything. When a man went up to remove the bell, and that bell fell to the ground, and rang out, all the people burst into tears. Everyone was weeping, and saying goodbye to the bell, because that was the last time that bell rang." ~ Alexandra Kowalska, wife of priest from Poltava.
