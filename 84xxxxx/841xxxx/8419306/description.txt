Plot

The story follows two fictional characters "Mick & Kev" that have nothing going for them. They are stereotypical bogans with a taste for cheap thrills. Kev's hobby is being angry, his motto is "Maximum fear, minimum time". He has not got a job but he has got an attitude. His best mate is Mick and together they kill time drinking beer, watching the Idiot Box and looking for action on the street.

One day Kev tells Mick they have drawn their last dole cheque. Instead they are going to get rich quick doing the only thing they are qualified for - crime. Conning a friend into driving the getaway car, the gang of three plan a bank robbery. But it is a heist that is doomed from the start when professional criminals target the same bank.
