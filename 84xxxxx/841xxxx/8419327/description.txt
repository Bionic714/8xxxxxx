Uploader notes:
This is free software, see  but the preview release is not public as the developers need donations. You should donate anyway, but fuck the paywall. Free software should be free, not just for people who know how to compile from source. Use this if you can't afford a donation or can't use or don't want to use PayPal.


Installation:
0. (Optional): Get the latest GPGTools suite from https://gpgtools.org
1. Unzip
2. Close Mail.app
3. Run PKG (you can safely overwrite the 10.7 Lion GPGMail with this one if you use GPGTools)
