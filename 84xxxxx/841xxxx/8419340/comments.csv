Thanks for the upload, and please, everyone, SEED!!!"

To not give away anything, at the end of part 1 it gives away some results that haven't happened yet.  Unfortunately when downloaded, all torrents showed 0 seeders and 0 leechers."

FYI: 'Part 2' has the last 3 fights."

End of video 1, the screen flips to the end of the fight when they are going over the results. I heard the results of Big Country's fight before I saw it. Can't figure how this mistake could happen? The end in the middle?"
