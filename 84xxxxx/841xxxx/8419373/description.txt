So, here they are, in full HD glory!


Lots to explain. So little time..


Basically, I took the TrollHD 1080i MMPRTM release and re-encoded it (with proper deinterlace and custom rescaler) to 720p, then took the AC3 5.1 audio from the NTSC DVD and synced it to the movie. Then, muxed the streams to MKV

The Turbo Movie is untouched as I got it, ripped by DFLIX.


I have to say this. NONE of files where downloaded from WEB-P2P-WHATEVER (EXCEPT for the Soundtracks included, which are from www.prmhub.com ). 
So, no, I did not download torrents from here.


I hope you enjoy and as always, SEED BACK!
