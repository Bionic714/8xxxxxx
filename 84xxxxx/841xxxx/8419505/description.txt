Sesame

Stealthy file encryption manager

Sesame is a file encryption program, designed to make file encryption fast and easy, and in such manner, that the fact of hiding or opening the information would not be visible or obvious. Two rules were followed and implemented. First - the encrypted files look as if nothing happened to them, file date and time are left unchanged, file icon is also preserved in most cases. Only from Sesame window user may see a hanging padlock picture on icons of those files that were encrypted. And second is, that if you choose, you may even start the program with a secret keys combination, instead of using a desktop shortcut or start menu item. As with other encryption managers, you may send encrypted files by e-mail, or transfer them by any other means, but only a person who has the Sesame program and knows a password can restore them to initial state.

For user convenience a minimal set of traditional for file managers functionality was added, such as Copy / Paste, Create New, Delete, Open operations.
