,Eldriken,2013-04-28T11:56Z,Is this the same as the other one listed? Just plays to the end of the first stage and then you can no longer progress?

,Mafu11,2013-04-28T19:59Z,"If it's only one level, does it worth to download?"

[T],aviara,2013-04-29T13:48Z,i`v played for 3 hours and i`m at lvl 9 so no it`s not only 1 lvl
,GObonzo,2013-04-29T14:49Z,"in beta(closed) there is a closed door at the end of the 1st stage that does not open. this is not a beta bug, it is intended by developers. you get a few hrs of play and couple missions but cannot progress through tunnels.    
so this one is not cracked?"
,Relaq,2013-04-29T18:26Z,Fuck! its right. there is a closed door at the end of the 1st stage that does not open.I am at Level 10 in Carpter1 but Carpter2 dosent go.Because i hat it Fun for 5 Hours
[T],aviara,2013-04-30T17:08Z,On 22 may will be the final release
,GObonzo,2013-05-01T19:28Z,"kinda fucked up ""the scene"" doesnt even care about good games like this. seems theyre just as commercial as most big industry, only care about whats mainstream popular. im sure when it's released we'll get a copy cracked. but, there's no way this 7GB is only just the 1sy stage. the rest of the game has got to be hiding in here waiting to be cracked loose."
