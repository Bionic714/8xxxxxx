,Matinator10,2013-04-28T15:20Z,"I think it should be possible to play online. Go to HELP & OPTIONS -> Settings -> bottom option set it to LAN instead of STEAM, then go to the mission selection screen, press P on your keyboard. Do this on multiple PCs and see if it works."
,Matinator10,2013-04-28T15:24Z,"Nevermind that, game crashes as soon as you host a game."
,momolbfr,2013-04-28T16:48Z,works fine
,dp098765,2013-04-28T16:51Z,Why is the installer for an English game in a different language?
,korelon,2013-04-28T18:35Z,"why game crash when i try multiplayer?
is there a solution?"
,Toon11,2013-04-29T01:40Z,"*I downloaded this game from Torrentz, so take this warning with a grain of salt.

The torrent I downloaded was about the same size, same # of files, and probably contained a virus. I am not sure but my system started freaking out shortly after the install with trojans detected and high CPU load."
,Toon11,2013-04-29T01:42Z,"Well, damn. I should try reading the notes before blabbing about malware."
,zanak,2013-04-29T07:06Z,"Thank you HeroMaster, working fine minus the LAN option

When we press F2 we can see this is the 9.60 version with the ""LAN bug""

I guess version 9.60b fixes it (bug 3955 in changelog)

You have, by any chance, the 9.60b version HeroMaster?
