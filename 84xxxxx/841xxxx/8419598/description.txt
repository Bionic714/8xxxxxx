In this installment in director Lucas Belvaux's trilogy, the comedy centers around how a husband's eccentric behavior leads to his wife having suspicions about their marriage. Cecile is a teacher who is still madly in love with her husband Alain, a hypochondriac who is convinced that a routine operation will take his life. He doesn't want to alarm his wife, and she mistakes his secrecy for him having an affair. Enter Pascal, who is hired by Cecile to track Alain, but who falls in love with Cecile instead.
