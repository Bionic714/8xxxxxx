Allen Stone calls himself "a hippie with soul," and he sort of is, but one would never expect to look at him that he possesses one of the most soulful voices this side of Marvin Gaye, with a joyous, positive feel and energy to match. This self-titled set was originally independently released by Stone in 2011 (an earlier self-released album, Last to Speak, appeared in 2010) and then picked up and given a national release by artist-friendly label ATO Records in 2012. It showcases this talented singer, although one really has to see him live to completely get him -- he doesn't look like he could possibly sing like that. But he does. There's a bright future here. Soul is where you find it.
