ALL THE SIR PAUL RELEASES ARE FAKES."

Aside from the dumbass comment, it's pretty disappointing quality for such a large file size, in my opinion (and I have downloaded thousands of movies and video files). But it may have been from the original source because the quality is in and out crisp to choppy artifacts, back and forth."
