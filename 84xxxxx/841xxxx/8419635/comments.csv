,Delief,2013-05-15T18:58Z,Replacing the AU isn't working. Can anyone confirm this has worked for them?
,vnebula,2013-05-26T08:22Z,"This worked perfect for me.

1. Install.
2. Go to ""Macintosh HDD/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components"" and replace all of the components with the included component files.
3. Use in whatever software program you have (such as Ableton)

Note: For Ableton, you need to turn on Audio Units in the preferences menu before you can use these.

Thanks DADA, this is great!"
