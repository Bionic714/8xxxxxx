,Footclaw,2013-05-02T01:01Z,When I load a set and do a render of the master track then my plugins start to freeze and some of them are not working during the render (its like theyre off).. I have to reboot live to get them fixed.. I didn't have this problem with the 9.0.1 release.. Ill try to reinstall live 9.0.3 or go back to the 9.0.1 :/
