"Unfiltered and unvarnished...a testament to human dignity and strength."
~ Ali Abunimah, The Electronic Intifada

"(The film) is propaganda that represents a biased view of the group with whom Israel finds itself at war." ~ Sonya David-Elmalea, Israeli Film Censorship Board

"I hope they will censor every film I do. I want them to understand my reality, another truth..."
 ~ Director Mohamed Bakri, in response to the ban of Jenin Jenin in Israel

"Where is God," an elderly man desperately wonders, when surveying the debris in the Palestinian refugee camp, Jenin.

Directed and co-produced by Palestinian actor Mohamed Bakri, Jenin Jenin includes testimony from Jenin residents, after the Israeli army's Defensive Wall operation of April, 2002. The city and camp were the scenes of fierce fighting, which ended with Jenin flattened, and scores of Palestinians dead. Palestinians, as well as numerous human rights groups accused Israel of committing war-crimes in the attack. The United Nations appointed a commission of inquiry, but Israel refused to let it's members visit the scene.

Banned in Israel, "Jenin Jenin" is dedicated to Iyad Samoudi, the producer of the film, who returned home to Yamun after the shooting of the film was completed. On June 23, as Israeli forces besieged Yamun, Samoudi was shot and killed as he was leaving a military-closed area with three friends.
