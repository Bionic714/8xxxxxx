Book Description


With its fresh, fun, and hip approach, Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity, helps to teach users what they need and want to know about sexuality while clearly conveying foundational biological and health issues and citing current and classic research.

The book continues to be a product of author Janell Carroll's partnership with her users, answering the questions and concerns that users have about themselves and their sexuality with scientific fact, sensitivity, humor, and unmatched candor.

Carroll presents the range of sexual orientations and behaviors and takes into account the social, religious, ethnic, racial, and cultural contexts of today's users; this edition includes even more examples and research on sexual diversity both within and across cultures.

An excellent resource package supports users, including videos, an online tutorial featuring diagnostic quizzing and automatic grading, and the PowerLecture presentation tool with readymade lecture slides, text images, and questions on slides for use with user response system software and "clickers."
