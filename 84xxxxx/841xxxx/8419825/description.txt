Modern bellydance is an amalgam of historical dance styles coming from both East and West. Bellydance is one of the most artistically-open and fastest-growing contemporary dance forms. It is popular on the club dance floors, featured in sexy music videos, and is a growing fitness trend. 

Bellydance is an amazing source of physical, social, and emotional benefits. It stimulates and heals the body, prompts weight loss, has a meditative effect on the mind, and lifts the spirit by enabling you to own your feminine power. Bellydance cultivates companionship among women, and helps us take a more confident and open stance toward the world. 

These unique benefits are making bellydance a modern lifestyle phenomenon - a way to find freedom from the ordinary and get in touch with your inner goddess!
