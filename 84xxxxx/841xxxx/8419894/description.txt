4)  Fearless Planet 
4.56 billion years ago, a planet the size of Mars collided with our Earth. It set off a chain of events that would transform the Earth from a lifeless wasteland into the fertile, blue planet we know today. This is that story. Our intrepid team of scientists gets hands-on with the evidence to find out how volcanic eruptions, collisions with comets and the unstoppable drift of the continents across the globe have combined to push up some of the most spectacular landscapes in the world. In this epic tale, we shall learn how life has survived catastrophe after catastrophe to emerge ever stronger in a constantly changing world. Narrated By Simon Kerr
