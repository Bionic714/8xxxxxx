------------------------------

Take a rollercoaster ride through the decade that made us! 

The ┬æ80s is not about nostalgia; it is about a decade of people, decisions and inventions that changed our future, told from the perspective of unknowing history makers who lived these iconic moments. It was 10 years of nonstop glamour, unchecked excess, ruthless ambition and explosive technological innovation that combined to produce the historic changes and global events that made us who and what we are today.

The fingerprints of the decade best known for Pac-Man and the personal computer are everywhere in our daily lives: The first launch of NASA┬Æs Space Shuttle triggered a technological explosion in global communications that now makes our world-wide love affair with smartphones and the Internet possible; when Madonna rolled around on stage in a wedding dress at a music awards show, it sent shock waves through a celebrity-hungry world that can┬Æt get enough of ┬ôGangnam Style┬ö and Lady Gaga today.

Take an epic journey back in time with original interviews from music and film superstars as well as global titans of technology, business, media and politics , unforgettable archival footage and memorable moments that only the 80┬Æs could provide.


1)  Lift Off 
In this global mega-doc, National Geographic tells the story of the 1980s like never before. An epic rollercoaster ride told through astonishing archive and dramatic reconstruction, The 80s features interviews with music and film superstars as well as titans of technology, business, media and politics. We┬Æll bring you ten years of breakneck innovation, glamour, success, and ambition, all shot through fascinating trends. Welcome back to the 1980s.

2)  The Revolutionaries 
In 1981, Ronald Reagan is propelled into the U.S. presidency. Reagan┬Æs business mandate leads to a new breed of entrepreneurs, including Steve Jobs, whose ┬ô1984┬ö style commercial helped launch the Super Bowl commercial phenomenon; Ted Turner, who re-invents the news business with the creation of 24-hour news; and Ben & Jerry, who successfully combine the hippie vibe of the 1960s with the entrepreneurial spirit of the 1980s.

3)  Shop Till You Drop 
Nonstop glamour and excess find a new poster girl in the 1980s when a hot young singer sees her chance to create her own brand. Madonna inspires countless girls across the globe to hit the nearest shopping mall to match her distinctive style. Young men with money to burn are buying into the young professional - or "yuppie" - lifestyle, and scooping up the latest expensive gadget: the cell phone. And, marketers learn an important lesson about the power of these new consumers in 1985 when Coca Cola┬Æs disastrous launch of New Coke threatens its position against Pepsi.

4)  Masters of the Universe 
With the mantra "greed... is good," Gordon Gekko encapsulates the 1980┬Æs drive for excess and ruthless ambition in Oliver Stone┬Æs "Wall Street" while big traders mirror his notoriously bad behaviour with insider trading and drug use in real life. In the 80s, CEOs see their salaries skyrocket while women struggle to overcome office boys┬Æ clubs. And, the quest to climb higher also leads to one of the ┬æ80s biggest tragedies, as NASA┬Æs Space Shuttle Challenger explodes during lift off, claiming the lives of all on board.

5)  Tear Down These Walls 
The 80s - often described as the decade when greed was good. But it also marked the beginning of a potent alliance between charity and celebrity. Huge events are staged to deal with the crisis of poverty abroad and at home. President Reagan has set out a vision of a better future for Americans in the famous campaign ad, Morning in America. His foreign policy, however, is paying dividends - he is breaking down barriers as he pushes for an end to the Cold War.

6)  Super Power 
As the 1980s draw to a close, the Cold War might be thawing, but the Berlin Wall still stands. America deploys a powerful ┬æweapon┬Æ to hasten its fall: pop culture. American movies, TV shows, music, and even the news, carry U.S. values and ideas out to the world and into the Soviet Bloc, swaying hearts and minds.
