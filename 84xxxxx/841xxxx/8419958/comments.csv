,dbolic,2013-04-28T23:54Z,"All Sir Pauls uploads are LEGIT, whoever has been downloading his stufff for the past years knows this as fact."
,jusclem74,2013-04-29T05:27Z,"wrx is right. this is a fake torrent. just tried it and it asked for password. if it says ""sir paul"" but was uploaded by someone else,... 80% of the time it's fake. sir paul's torrent are usually taken off it's original torrent site ( i'm not telling which one, it's our secret!) and re-uploaded by different people.
