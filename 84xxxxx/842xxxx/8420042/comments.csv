,ReconIII,2013-04-28T19:56Z,"Really, Really!? You boosted the audio in mexican, stop telling people this is english, this is in mexican or hungarian or something!"

,ReconIII,2013-04-28T21:29Z,"NTM about half way through you start to play the audio from the start over the current audio... really!? lol fail

,versus802,2013-04-28T21:30Z,its in english but out of sync and after 40 min its also dubbel audio. thx for the effort but its anwatchable after 40 minutes cause the dubbel audio
,Calireefer,2013-04-28T21:52Z,"I did download it before I posted a comment. Static/mic noise, out of sync, and 95% is unintelligible. The current cam audio that it out is such a turd it can't be polished. Appreciate the effort to clean it up but it was in vain. "
,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-28T22:54Z,"Agreed that this audio is no better than the other versions available.

Until somebody gets a Line audio or another Cam, please stop re-uploading the same files over and over.

After listening to the English versions available right now, I think it might be easier to learn Hungarian than to filter, boost and resync the English audio."
[V],globeplus,2013-04-28T23:27Z,"Hi everyone and it is respectfull all the comments about this video file , all of us certainly want better copys available soon as possible for this movie , all of us knows also that camera angle incorrect , unfocus of the camera , guys standing up in front of the screen or momentaneous problems with the camera stability are some of the cams possibilities when we get new cams of the new movies , on this case was the low audio and in a kind of echo style and i maded an effort to at least improve the general audition of the audio in an higher sound level , my site community friends i suggest to keep your atention on new possible video files for this movie because i understand that in the perspective of the viewer , a new nice movie must be watched at the minimum with video and audio acceptable , of course that i respect and thanks any effort from the camera guy uploader but he needs to understand also that the general viewers of the video file want the film in general better conditions than this and that point is understandable for shore ... so keep atention in new files , sorry for something beside my understandable effort in trying improving the audio and i wish soon as possible that all of you get the opportunity to watch nicely this movie , unfornatly for the moment this is the best video file that can be offer but better copys probably shows up soon, who knows?!!! see all of you around and nice movies to all of you ..."
