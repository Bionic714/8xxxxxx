,Wisher_SiD,2013-05-03T17:53Z,"If you are playing on Windows 7, then you dont have to set XP or any other compatibility option. Just make sure to have the latest DirectX installed as well as admin rights (if the game doesn't work)."
,PseudoPositive,2013-05-07T05:27Z,"It could use a patch for some graphics issues, but apart from that, this game is a neat adventure RPG. I don't see why the creators of this game don't just make a PG-13 version of this & sell it on Steam or something like that, they have the talent to rival many other game creators of this genre, thanks for the upload Wisher_SiD, cheers.

PS. It's UNCENSORED"
