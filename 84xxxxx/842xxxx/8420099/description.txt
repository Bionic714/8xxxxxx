This is Whorecraft: The Chronicles of Alexstrasza, a World of Warcraft parody porn game made in the Unreal 3 Engine by Auril. 
It plays like a regular rpg, you walk around doing quests, collecting items, talking to npcs and of course... Having sex! The sex scenes play mostly in 2 different ways: either its basically a slideshow of images or its animated ingame and you can control the camera or progress the scene.
Now the game is still W.I.P and this is just the first episode, so its definitely not finished but its playable and quite good as well.

The game is divided into five episodes. The full version of each episode will be free, but people who donate 25Γé¼ to develop project will have early access to episodes of the game and gallery on the website. In addition donators can take part in the beta testing of each episode long before its release.[/quote]
