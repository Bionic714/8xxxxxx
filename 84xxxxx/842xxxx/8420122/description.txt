Blast, Bash, or Smash - Take down ornery outlaws in 3rd-person, fists-flyin' brawls or 1st-person, both-barrels-blazin' shootouts
Live ammo - choose how you abuse. Load your double-barreled crossbow with Chippunks, Boombats, and other "live" ammo
Based in the unique Oddworld universe that brings to life the most bizarre creations
Overview:
You're the Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter on a mission to bag the ultimate prize. And you need that money like no one else because there is something very wrong with your health and the only way to fix it is a very costly operation. However the nature of your illness remains a secret and as you find out during the game, for a good reason.

This world is full of bad guys so there is plenty to do. Each opponent is different, sometimes in the most bizarre way so you have to be careful and adapt your tactics to each target individually. So load up your double-barreled crossbow with up to 81 living ammo combinations. Track down those criminals with money on their head and bring them in, dead or alive. Welcome to the Mongo River Valley, the irony mining capital of the continent.
