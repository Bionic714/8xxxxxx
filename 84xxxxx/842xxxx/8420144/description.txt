Hopefully you enjoy it, as I have the countless terabytes I have acquired through PirateBay over the years. Remember everybody, this site and others like it are a full circle, and only work with cooperation between all parties involved. So please for every 1GB of material downloaded try to at minimum give back (upload) 0.5GB back, because without someone seeding that latest episode of your favorite show last week, you wouldn't have it either.
