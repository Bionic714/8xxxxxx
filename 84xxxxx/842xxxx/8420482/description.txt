Capturing the beauty of pregnancy through photographs is an increasingly popular trend, and this timely guide covers the basics of maternity photography from both artistic and business standpoints. 
The details of creating a successful maternity portrait are addressed, including how to select a meaningful location, what props and fabrics to use, how to pose the subject, and how to produce a flattering lighting scheme.


Helpful digital effects that can enhance skin tone and impart a wide variety of polished and artistic effects are discussed, as are tactics for incorporating other family members in the portrait. 

Also included are tips for building a strong connection with the subject that can lead to a profitable, lifelong client relationship.
