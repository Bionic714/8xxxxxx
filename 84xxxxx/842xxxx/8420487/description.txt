Thus begins The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, the Academy Award-winning film starring Brad Pitt as a man who is born in his eighties and ages backward, and Cate Blanchett as the woman he is destined to love forever. The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a monumental journey - as unusual as it is epic - that follows Benjamin's remarkable adventure of romance and redemption from the end of World War I through the twenty-first century. Directed by David Fincher, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a powerful testament to life and death, love and loss.
