,ChingaTuu,2013-04-29T00:51Z,"...Hey Mothra, I'll seed this for a spell, probably the rest of today and maybe tomorrow. Thanks for the original seed,d00d! This was one of the better MLJ books from the Golden Age, and it's good to see someone else out there who appreciates the classics.

The rest of you kids, quit reading crap by Millar, Bendis and Liefeld, and read something *fun* for a change!!!"
,Mothra67,2013-04-29T02:50Z,"Liefeld? I hate that guy! He ruined modern comics for me! what he did to Ditko's Hawk and Dove, he should be shot for!

Thanks for the seed!  Hope you enjoy.  Any other Golden age requests? Just LMK!!!  :)"
,ChingaTuu,2013-04-29T05:11Z,"...The original ""H&D"" mini that relaunched the characters was written by Karl and Barb Kesel - two of the late 80's best writers, IMO. All Liefeld did was draw with little to no creative input. At the time, he was this punk kid who had this art style that echoed Todd the Clodd McFarlane, but was unique enough to not immediately be recognized as such. However, now as then, he did not know how to draw feet. The runaway ego and the coke habits came not long after that, along with the inability to meet deadlines.

...That ""Nu-52"" ""H&D"" title, tho...now *that* blew sweaty, hairy, AIDS-carrying African Green Monkey nuts. Both of them. In one mouth. On a webcam on DC's corporate home page. For Dildio to whack off to.

But enough about Cokefeld. I'll be seeding this at a rather good speed - I can actually spare about 65K/s for uploads - until the end of the month. Then de welfare check come in de mail, and after I take mah food stamps to de comic book shop and trades dem fo new comics, and I goes and buys me a new extra hard drive so's I's can downloads mo' free comics that I don't nevah pay fo. And a new video card! Word!

No. Wait. I already downloaded Word. Ah well, whoever else downloads from me or Mothra on this torrent, be sure to let it seed for at least 48 hours after the upload finishes, so everyone can get this and hopefully keep the propagation going. Remember, SHARING IS LIFE!"
