,filthy3825,2013-04-28T19:59Z,"hello steelerj17,  when will you up ""dogma""?"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-28T20:25Z,@filthy3825 This week! After that I will not be taking anymore requests!
,filthy3825,2013-04-28T22:57Z,thank you. may i ask why?
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-28T23:42Z,"@filthy3825 I got so overwhelmed with everybody's request and it was effecting my health. I'm still going to upload certain types of movies (New Releases, Criterion's etc.)"
,famemon78,2013-04-29T00:02Z,great to have u back SteelerJ17 :) take ur time with the uploads as and when you please.. we should be much more respectful of the kind of effort it must take to upload so many wonderful movies. and mindful of the time it must consume thanks again
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T00:31Z,@famemon78 I think I was going WAY too fast! I have some great Criterion's coming soon. Some of the them are out of print. 
,filthy3825,2013-04-29T00:31Z,i can see how the copious requests would take a toll on your well-being. good self-awareness that your health was being adversely affected. rest up and take care bro.
,LouisAnderson,2013-04-29T13:34Z,"I would like to second the compliments for the great work from Steeler J17.

And I fully understand his stand: I was having problems myself to keep up with the rhythm of uploads! Specially because a) I don´t have any external disks and b) I believe in sharing for as long as possible.

I actually had some requests on hold because of this, but I´m OK: they´re from Criterion, so eventually they will come. Or not: ""que sera, sera"".

My suggestion? A few releases a week, at your rhythm, without pressure, between classics and more recent. Let them breathe. Eventually, once in a while choose 3 titles and ask which one would we like to be uploaded next.

Specially, enjoy the process of choosing like we enjoy to find what´s coming next, and the exchange of ideas with movie fans (like in this thread)."
,LouisAnderson,2013-04-29T13:39Z,"For SteelerJ17,

Also, could you see if everything is OK with the release of ""Being John Malkovich"" disc 1? I can´t find the audio commentary. 

Many thanks."
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T14:47Z,"@LouisAnderson I've checked it Being John Malkovich.  Audio commentary is located ""Select-Scene Commentary"" in the main menus. Certain scenes of the movie has commentary. "
