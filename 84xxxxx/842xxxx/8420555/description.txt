In 1914, an orphaned child named John Aman was chosen by the Tibetan Council of Seven to be trained to both mental and physical perfection. When he was 25, he was ready to fight crime in the outside world. He returned to America and did just that. He was helped by Zona Henderson, a female investigator, but later traded her out for her kid brother, Tommy the Amazing Kid. Amazing Man's powers include super strength, invulnerability, and the ability to make himself disappear in a cloud of green vapour. It is because of that last power that he is also known as the "Green Mist." Amazing Man's arch-enemy is The Great Question, an evil telepath who was exiled from the Council of Seven after Aman exposed his true nature.

In his second adventure (Amazing-Man Comics #6) he is captured by kidnappers. While a willful prisoner, the Great Question telepathically causes the villainous aspects of Aman to come to the fore, actually physically transforming his face to match his new evil. Eventually, Aman is able to shake off the effects.
