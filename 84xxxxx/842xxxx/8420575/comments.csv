,kshithij,2013-04-28T21:35Z,How is audio?
,gojira87,2013-04-28T21:54Z,"it would help if people would seed, so we can see what the REAL deal is with this. Its says English as audio...47000 leechers and 109 seeding and NOTHING coming from those folks "
,Sgt.Hulka,2013-04-28T22:27Z,"Read the info at the bottom. It says about 2 minutes and 19 sec. is HUN audio, and the rest is English.

But you have to seed if you want to find out how good it is. From what I've seen and heard so far it sounds better than any of the others."
,ProphetZarquon,2013-04-28T22:50Z,"Same useless audio.

After listening to the English versions available right now, I think it might be easier to learn Hungarian than to filter, boost and resync the English audio."
,gojira87,2013-04-29T04:41Z,Fake asks for codec 
,Sgt.Hulka,2013-04-29T09:07Z,"NOT Fake. Does NOT ask for codec.

Quit lying."
