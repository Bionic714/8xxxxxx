Sam Wills (born 28 August 1978), is a New Zealand prop-comic currently residing in London. On stage he performs as "The Boy With Tape On His Face"[1] or as one half of the two person act "Spitroast" or simply as Sam Wills.[2] He performs regularly on the New Zealand Comedy Circuit, has featured in the New Zealand International Comedy Festival[3] and the World Buskers Festival.[4]

Sam Wills began his performing career in Timaru at the age of thirteen while he trained as an apprentice clown. He has since mastered a diverse range of performance styles and skills. He holds a diploma in New Circus from Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology's Circus School where he has taught juggling there for two years. His interest in the phenomenon of traditional circus freak shows and influences such as the Jim Rose Circus and the Tokyo Shock Boys led to experiments with shock comedy, earning him his first Pulp Comedy appearance, the Best New Face award for the 2001 season, and the title ΓÇÿPrince of CringeΓÇÖ from Truth and TV Extra magazine.

Until 2001, Sam was a driving force in the Christchurch entertainment scene, featured at balls, private functions and corporate events; running weekly comedy nights and appearing on local television.

January 2002 saw Sam move to Auckland to become resident comedian at the casino in SKYCITY Auckland. His weekly show, the NCB Comedy Hour, is now in its fourth year and continues to push the boundaries of comedy performance with its blend of circus skill and vaudeville style.

In March 2008 Sam took his show 'The Boy With Tape On His Face' to the Melbourne Comedy Festival, where it received great critical acclaim.

After Melbourne, Sam moved to London.
