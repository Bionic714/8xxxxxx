,yaboo_56,2013-05-02T05:33Z,"Thank You ! and for any doubters this IS the full banned ep 4, I've watched it."
,axekitty,2013-05-06T09:20Z,"thanks a million! watched it too already, it is the full complete banned ep. it was awesome! "
,axekitty,2013-05-06T09:22Z,"the only cons are that they're in korean hardsubs including certain location indications like ""Virginia"" will be in korean too, and they are kinda big so if you open a softsub it will overlap it. to be honest it was quite distracting but its ok you just have to use earphones and you can hear the words really clearly without subs lol."

,jblack99,2013-05-10T19:40Z,"This episode was NOT banned.  The network CHOSE not to air it in the U.S. because they believed it contained sensitive material that related to the Boston bombings. That was stupid on their part since it had nothing to do with that bombing incident.

When they voluntarily choose not to air something, that is NOT the meaning of BANNED."
