,ectoendomezo,2013-05-01T15:03Z,"Thanks..

This is a remake/rr-imagining of 'The Groove Tube'.

Decent..the first short is actually great..imho..good actors..made a good skit..the look on her face..stunned disbelief is truly hilarious..

I'm not sure there is a ""Russian Version""..just a Russian DUB that confused the situation..I've only seen this 'version' but with Ivan dubbed voice over..this one seems to be pro-product/commercial release."
,billybob13579,2013-05-06T07:16Z,Where the scenes with dennis quiad and greg kinear? I went and saw this in the movies before but this copy doesnt have those scenes?

,MyKrossini,2013-05-30T02:23Z,"Hey YIFY, in your description of the plot, you are referring to the OTHER version of this film. There are more than one. This one is the one where all the story lines are brought together by 3 kids searching the internet for the banned movie, ""Movie 43."" I would love if you could upload the alternate version which includes ""The Pitch."" These are CLEARLY two separate versions. Thanks. Have a wonderful day."
