,pythonista99,2013-04-28T21:04Z,41 Gigabytes of mystical crap.  I don't think so.  What will really be interesting to see will be how many idiots there are who actually will try to download this.  
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-04-28T21:13Z,As you wish. At least don't make stupid comments
,aq313,2013-05-10T03:54Z,"Thanks mate, fuck the shit.bz and their greedy twisted ways"
,aq313,2013-05-10T04:07Z,"can yo plz list all books on your uploads because am sure i already have many and my download is limited, and maybe if you redo the torrents in files instead of rar so i can disable the ones i have, thanks mate "
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-05-10T09:17Z,I cannot upload my torrents in files because TPB doesn't allow .torrent files larger than 200KB. I have included file listing.
,aq313,2013-05-12T20:30Z,"i only need Draja Mickaharic books there are like five of them, can you plzzzzzzzzzz make a torrent for them, thanks"
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-05-12T21:38Z,tell me which ones.
,aq313,2013-05-13T08:57Z,"just open your list with firefox, go to the edit tab then find, type draja in there and you'll see them they are very small like five or six of them in a row"

,Obsolette,2013-05-30T23:30Z,"Do you have the Tibetan/Oriental stuff including the secret books from theoccult.bz? Many books - including Tony Duff restricted ones - can be found at http://libgen.org and similar sites, but some books from the same Tony Duff, Dechen Ling Press and Namkhai Norbu were never leaked..."
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-05-31T08:29Z,I don't know... Highly unlikely since not every section is full.
,Nabijemte231,2013-06-03T13:53Z,"Thanks mate :)  Wery good work :)
Too bad I dont have 40 GB free space, It would be best if you could somehow upload all books and not rar file. Maybe some other torrent tracker doesnt have 200kb rule, let us know if you can do it :) Thanks again, best wishes :)"
,w4r3zh4ck,2013-06-03T14:23Z,"I won't bother uploading the same torrents again *even if* TPB allows large torrents. I will test it though and if it works, next torrents will be unrared."
