You staff of *.bz torrent trackers disabled all my accounts on all your trackers. HA! Guess what.. It came to no surprise for me!! All your torrent base are belong to me! And I will spread it to the masses.. How you feel about that? How you feel about exploiting your user base for money and then disabling accounts for no fucking reason at all?

Why even close signups for the public, when almost all your torrents will be available on TPB?

You do seriously believe your banning will stop me from sharing all my occult collection? You must be on crack or something..

------------------
To whoever bitching about what's inside, I've included .html listing. TPB doesn't allow .torrent files larger than 200 KB.
