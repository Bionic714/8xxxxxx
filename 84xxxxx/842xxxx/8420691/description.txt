Book Description

The Cooking Healthy book details three diet plans, the Paleo Diet, Diabetic Recipes, and the Gluten Free diet. 

These two diets are a great means to help lose weight and become healthier while dealing with certain health conditions.

They also help people with detrimental health conditions like diabetes, gluten intolerance, and gluten allergies.
Diet and nutrition are excellent means of treating these conditions and often help to alleviate the ill symptoms completely caused by these health concerns. 
The Paleo Diet section covers recipes just for the Paleo Diet. The Paleo Diet is the diet our ancestors ate back during the Stone Age. Historical research shows these people were healthy and lived long lives.
They did not suffer from the same ailments we do today, in particular, they had healthy hearts, healthy blood sugar, and good weight levels. Paleo Diet is the absence of grains and legumes.
They eat a heavy diet of fruits and vegetables and proteins from meat. There are recipes to cover meals and snacks for the entire day and enough to make well over a week's worth of meal plans. 
The Gluten Free section covers the reasons for choosing a gluten free diet. Many will choose this diet regardless of having any intolerances or allergies for the simple fact they are able to lose weight and feel good. 
This diet promotes a healthy immune system and replaces grain gluten with other natural foods like arrowroot and tapioca. The recipes are rich in vegetables and fruits, providing well-balanced and filling meals.
In addition, there are suggestions and tips on maintaining a gluten free diet outside of cooking and eating at home. You can be gluten free even while dining out at restaurants or eating with friends or family at their homes and while away from your own home.
