,iappz,2013-05-03T07:25Z,"Excuse me, Try open with TextEdit ~/Documents/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/config.ini and change 
""; The currently selected language.
Language = es_ES

; The currently selected spoken language.
AudioLanguage = es_ES""

to

""; The currently selected language.
Language = en_US

; The currently selected spoken language.
AudioLanguage = en_US""

If not work, Go to Civ App, pull down the Action menu on App, open ""drive_c"" alias, open Program Files/civ/ and with TextEdit replace 'Language = ""spanish""' with ""Language = ""english"""" in 3DMGAME.ini file

Save & You will have the Game in English."
