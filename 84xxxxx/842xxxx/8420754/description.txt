9/11 THE FALLiNG MAN (DVD5)

This is the story behind one of the most defining images of September 11, 2001.

The Falling Man tells the story of the most unforgettable image from 9/11 - of a falling man, frozen in mid-air, perfectly vertical and parallel with the World Trade Center behind him. This image ran in newspapers and magazines across the world, and should have been the defining image of that terrible day. Instead, it was suddenly and inexplicably taken out of circulation. Why?

Many people were seen, and captured on (this) film, falling from the WTC 1 & 2.

The only visible fatalities, on a day that claimed thousands.

The Falling Man follows the trail of the photograph - of the photographer who shot it, of the citizens who decried it, of the editors who published and then banned it, of the journalist who tried to identify the figure.
 It is an extraordinary trial.

Netanyahu was already thinking strategically. HereΓÇÖs how The New York Times reported it:

  Asked tonight what the attack meant for relations between the United States and Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, the former (and now current) prime minister, replied, ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs very good.ΓÇ¥ Then he edited himself: ΓÇ£Well, not very good, but it will generate immediate sympathy.ΓÇ¥ He predicted that the attack would ΓÇ£strengthen the bond between our two peoples, because weΓÇÖve experienced terror over so many decades, but the United States has now experienced a massive hemorrhaging of terror.ΓÇ¥

Even after generously allowing Netanyahu to ΓÇ£editΓÇ¥ himself, the Times did not conceal that Netanyahu was not thinking in terms of sympathy for the victims of 9/11 and the United States, nor what a ΓÇ£friendΓÇ¥ could do to help America. Rather, he was already thinking on the day it happened about how 9/11 could be manipulated to get America to do more for Israel.
