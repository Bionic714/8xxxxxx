Very much appreciate your most awesome selection of films to share.  

I've been downloading Ran Disc 1 for close to a week now and am stuck at 94.? and have already shared back 5.4 Gig. Unfortunately for me the two people with the full 100% keep coming and going, coming and going and sharing at an extremely small amount in the lowest kb/s range possible. I'm not being a Bitch but am finding it a little frustrating that I've been at 94% with no move forward for the passed two days.  I'll gladly keep this going at full pelt for a month once I've got it whole and cut to a disc."
