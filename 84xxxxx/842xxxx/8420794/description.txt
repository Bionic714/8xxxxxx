Professor Warren created an energy machine that he then used to give his son, Dan, superhuman powers. The energy machine allowed Dan to electric energy within his cells, which made him super-humanly stronger, faster and more resistant to injury than average human beings. It also allowed him to manipulate magnetism, which allowed him to fly and generate force-fields around his body.
