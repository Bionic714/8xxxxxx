This BigNoWhere. Being trying to grab your disc 2 of Ran and have had to keep turning it on and off as it slowed down my grabbing disc 1.  I now see that disc 2 has no seeders at all!!  Am concerned I won't be able to complete this amazing release and have it all too keep reseeding for myself.

Can you help me out please.

regards,

BigNoWhere"

Keep going Brother (or, Sister). You've got some items to be envious of. And I've got a collection nearing 6000. People should really be taking note and educating themselves via cinema history."
