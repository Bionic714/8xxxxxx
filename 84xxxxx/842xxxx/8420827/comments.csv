,Phatfish,2013-05-16T00:59Z,"A - Good

V - Fine

M - MUCH better then expected. Not perfect but a serious, objective, well edited documentary with more substance than usual. "

Not a single person interviewed provides either. It is a series of personal polls, and although most people have some relevance to the business, it is not statistically relevant. Nina Hartley is the only one that comes close to being sensible here, but even she does not appeal to studies, nor does the anti-porn professor. It's not objective, it's not fair, and it is  anything but a documentary."
