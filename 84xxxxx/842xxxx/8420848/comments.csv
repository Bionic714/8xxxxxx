[V],sujaidr,2013-04-28T22:10Z,i dont have a seed box so i'll provide maximum initial seeding but for the torrent to be alive please seed back too :-) ENJOY
,edodeniro,2013-04-29T01:56Z,"Very-very-very THANK YOU for this!!!
I wonder if you always upload another release from Criterion
thanks!!!"
,AsifAkheir,2013-04-29T02:13Z,"@ sujaidr, or anyone else who knows,
why does the torrent info say:
Seeders:   0
Leechers:  0

But utorrent claims:
Seeds:   0 of 13
Peers:    38 of 229

and yet only .628 Availability ?

Are these sorts of inconsistencies normal?
Is there something wrong? if so, at which end?
Merci."
[V],sujaidr,2013-04-29T02:59Z,"@edodeniro,i try to upload most of criterion release

@AsifAkheir,some probs with pirate bay since yesterday,none of the torrents uploaded from yesterday are showing the amount of seed/leech...hope it gets resolved but no probs with any of the torrents,i'm seeding and u'll get the movie irrespective of the stats shown here"

Excellent as usual. 
(for an extra 70MB I can replace my 270p DvdRip copy, with this 720p HD version)

If anyone's interested:
Here is a link to ""Terror's Advocate (2007)"", a documentary about lawyer Jacques Vergès who defended Djamila Bouhired, among other Algerian terrorists, and obtained their release. He eventually married Djamila and had two children with her.

It's not in HD but perhaps sujaidr can post a better version.
