RIVER includes his harmonic stunner, A Walk on Winfield Row, and two of his fans' favorites: I Knew It Was You, written about his experience with his deceased father on a hiking trail on Storm King Mountain, and The Most Beautiful Sky, which is a tune he wrote with his close friend, Bill Gurley, "after having the experience of seeing the same gorgeous sunset from 30 miles apart."
