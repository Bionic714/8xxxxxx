If youΓÇÖve listened to either of The AntlersΓÇÖ two records over the past three years, and if you come into Port St. WillowΓÇÖs Holiday with the knowledge that WillowΓÇÖs lone member Nick Principe has worked with the AntlersΓÇÖ frontman Peter Silberman, itΓÇÖll be pretty difficult to listen through Holiday without thinking of the Antlers. While on the surface this may read as a criticism or a complaint, by the time this re-released version of this 2012 album finishes, it will become apparent that it isnΓÇÖt.
ThatΓÇÖs because, while there are a number of sonic touchstones shared by both projects ΓÇö lofty, falsetto vocals, patient yet anxious atmospherics, a very human and deceptively warm sense of melancholy ΓÇö Port St. Willow and the Antlers feel like brothers. Not the type where one rides the coattails of the other, but the type where they forge their own paths but rub elbows because of their identical parentage. Songs like ΓÇ£AmawalkΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£TouristΓÇ¥ borrow a heavy sense of passion and drama from PrincipeΓÇÖs haunting voice, just like Silberman, but Principe doubles down on rising above the swirling atmospheric maelstroms he conjures, as opposed to diving in, as Silberman is wont to do. ItΓÇÖs a subtle difference, but one that sets the identities of the two projects apart.

When Holiday was released in 2012, it was right around the same time as the AntlersΓÇÖ Undersea EP, and it may have been that the shoulder-rubbing release dates meant Holiday was lost in the shuffle. So the re-release serves the purpose of allowing the Port St. Willow project its own space to breath, and it features a new, 25 minute (!) track called ΓÇ£Soft Light RushΓÇ¥ that encapsulates the Port St. Willow project while never feeling overlong in its running length. PrincipeΓÇÖs vocals are layered on top of each other in harrowing, piercing harmonies; syrup-thick chords swell and contract; moods shift and change with subtlety and grace. And the melodic touches further distance themselves from SilbermanΓÇÖs project. In that way, ΓÇ£Soft Light RushΓÇ¥ and the Holiday re-release explain exactly what they want to: that Port St. Willow is its own project, and one to watch at that.
