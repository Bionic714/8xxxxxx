I know you aren't taking requests, but is there any way you could re-upload some of your fantastic criterions that we couldn't finish?  Such as pina, green for danger, the friends of eddie coyle, the fire within, charade and stray dogs?

I know it's asking a lot, and understand if you don't.  I will be sure to seed!"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T00:10Z,@rasspitan Yes! I'm going to re-upload those. Thank you for your support!
