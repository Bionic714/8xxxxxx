A former drug user, Heidi is now clean and works as a rock DJ
at the local radio station along with fellow DJs, Herman Whitey
Salvador and Herman Jackson. Following one of their regular
evening shows, Heidi receives a square wooden box containing a
vinyl record, the only indication as to its origin is a note
proclaiming "A gift from the Lords". Assuming it is merely a
PR stunt by an ambitious band, Heidi gives the record a spin
and immediately begins to experience bizarre flashbacks to a
past, long-forgotten trauma triggered by the haunting sounds
contained on the record.
