It would be great if you could get the size down to a reasonable resolution. 72kb id the average screen resolution and would load much faster.

thanks again"
,CarbonMonoxide,2013-04-29T03:58Z,I think the file size is just fine. I like seeing large images. It shows more details as to whether I want to download or not. 614 kb size images shouldn't be a problem if you have a broadband connection.
