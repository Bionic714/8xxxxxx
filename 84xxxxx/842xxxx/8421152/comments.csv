[T],JMUTHAFUKND,2013-04-30T06:43Z,"right on, thanks! So is everyone getting this 100%   why is no body help seed?"

Volume 7 #43 isn't in this new one so I ripped it from a youtube video since it was one of the ones that wouldn't d/l from the first torrent. I'm literally out of bandwidth for another week on this shitty package but I've pumped up a share ratio of 5.295 already on the partial I have so far to help out.

[T],JMUTHAFUKND,2013-04-30T22:49Z,"LOL,NP    you pay for package bandwith? you have a limit?  THAT SUX "
