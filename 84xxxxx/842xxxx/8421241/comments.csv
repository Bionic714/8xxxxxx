Use VLC ->TOOLS>EFFECTS&FILTERS=>Enable Audio->PRESET TECHNO-> raise 16khz and preamp and audio is 7/10. Thanks uploader!

It's a CAM!!! DO A LITTLE WORK SLACKERS!"
,pwnt_soup,2013-04-29T01:33Z,"I'm not deaf and i cant read lips so i hope the audio is better with this copy, thanks TV Team for the effort either way. its not like you will post any info about any of your up loads so i will take a shot and see what happens"
,notnowplz,2013-04-29T01:45Z,yes MASTER!.............LOL
,lapis22,2013-04-29T01:50Z,y are people defending this shit upload?  I just dont get it.  the jackasses who keep uploading this shit copy should have their skulls taken away.  they could at least be honest in the description about the audio.
,lapis22,2013-04-29T01:57Z,"@tballsunurmouth  youre totaly full of shit with those audio settings, the audio on this is trash no amount of fiddling with audio settings will change that, also why would you defend this trash and the dishonest jackasses that are uploading it?  the least they could do is add to the info ""yes this is yet another copy that has unintelligible audio."""
,Calireefer,2013-04-29T03:33Z,LOL @ bielzilbob. Obviously the movie is out somewhere or else a CAM of it wouldn't be released. Only retard is you.
,BOLT_PRIDE,2013-04-29T04:31Z,"Bielz is a dumbshit!! Its out overseas. Read the news sometime, i.e. 
Yahoo headlines:
""Iron man 3 debuts huge overseas"""
,BOLT_PRIDE,2013-04-29T06:46Z,"Even with the improvement the sound is still terrible. I can barely understand every 4th word. Oh well, the up-loader tried. Nice of you to put forth the effort either way!"
,tingya,2013-04-29T11:00Z,"Same Video Audio is Filtered and normalized better than initial cam audio ,audio is good during quite sequences but all hell breaks loose wen it comes to action sequence
Thnx for the effort Uploader will wait for better audio still "
