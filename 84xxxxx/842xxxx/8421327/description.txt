WiFi Scanner is the most feature rich and complete WiFi scanning
app on the app store and is a great tool for personal use and for
IT professionals.

WiFi Scanner is an 802.11/WiFi wireless scanner and connection
manager for 802.11 a/b/g/n networks. WiFi Scanner is an easy to use
tool for designing, verifying, and troubleshooting WiFi coverage.
The tool provides information such signal strength, noise,
manufacturer name based on MAC address prefix of device (OUI), and
AP channel assignments for WiFi access points.

WiFi Scanner can also be used a security tool for detecting
unauthorized and rogue access points. The app includes an audio
alert (beep) feature that is directly related to RSSI / access
point signal strength. This feature can be used to track down
devices by listening for beep frequency instead of watching app
screen.
