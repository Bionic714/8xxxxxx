Description:

iFFmpeg is a graphical front-end for FFmpeg, a command-line tool used to convert multimedia files between formats. The command line instructions can be very hard to master/understand, so iFFmpeg does all the hard work for you. This allows you to use FFmpeg without detailed command-line knowledge.

Version 3.6.8:

    Added FFmpeg option ΓÇÿdialnormΓÇÖ for AC3 encoding.
    Dolby Prologic II now also works for AAC audio streams.
    Fixed issue with encoding to mpeg2video.
