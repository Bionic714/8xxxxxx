You Should Have Bought A Mac!"" on the screen over and over. It's a shame digital comics piracy didn't exist back then, because it would have been a pleasure to have denied the Beer Bums (sic) any of our money for their bullshit APA fanfic.

But hey, I'm not dissing the seeder here, and at least the scans of this run have been pretty good. Whoever's scanning these might consider throwing them into Photoshop - available at all fine Pirate Bays in your local area, or for about 6.5 Yuan on the streets of Singapore and Hong Kong! - and doing an Auto-Contrast. Sometimes that Baxter paper reflects back a scanner's light, and washes out the page a bit. Tweaking the color saturation up about 10% always helps. Unless the page was printed on those early Flexigraphic presses. Then you're better off just scanning them in as Black & White and letting whoever downloads them color them in themselves!!

And if you're downloading, take the risk and seed for a bit. Every one of you who seeds for at least 48 hours after downloading helps ensure proper propagation of the file(s), and proper props to the original seeder! Remember, SEEDING IS LIFE!
