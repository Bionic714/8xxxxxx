The Evil Queen

With the aid of Hook, Regina attempts to put a
plan in motion that will help transport herself
and Henry back to Fairytale land. But her plan
revolves around a fail-safe that was planted
within the curse, which if triggered could wipe
Storybrooke off the map and kill all of its
inhabitants: and Emma's suspicions about Tamara
grow. Meanwhile, in the fairytale land that was,
the Evil Queen asks Rumplestiltskin to transform
her into an unrecognizable peasant in order to
kill an unsuspecting Snow White, with the
twisted aim of earning the love and respect of
her subjects
