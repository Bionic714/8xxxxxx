,ChingaTuu,2013-04-29T05:37Z,"...There's an irony here. Dave Sim redefined the term ""Phone Book"" with his big cheap reprint collections, and now, like the White and Yellow Pages, ""Cerebus"" is now scanned into digital format and available online.

I'd love to seed this, but there's this *one* issue where Dave and I totally disagreed on that we actually had a nice three-hour conversation over, and agreed to disagree to some extent. And no, it wasn't the Rape of Astoria, but a pissing on Mankind's Greatest Achievement since the discovery of booze...:(

Still, let us know if it's legit, Mothra. I've been burned too many times with some catamite starting a really huge seed, and then either quitting before anyone else can complete the seed, or only staying active long enough for a few of his fellow butt-buddies(*) to finish their leachings and split! :( :( :( If the real deal, I'll leech a copy as the one I have is about five years old and a bit on the lo-rez side, like those that one particular scanner uploads to Usenet that are quick-n-dirty scans made fast with no attention to quality so he can simply crow about being the ""first"" with all the new zero-day scans.

Yeah, yeah, I know. I preach SEEDING IS LIFE, but in this case there's just this*one* weed that needs to be pulled out by the roots...

(*) No offense to our GLBT friends out there, as these type of dipshits ain't worthy enough to *have* sex, much less legitimate same-sex relationships!"
,m0rdant,2013-04-29T16:41Z,Issue #6 is missing the title page - same in the other Cerebus torrents I've found.  Anyone have that missing page or a complete copy of that issue?
,Mothra67,2013-04-29T17:41Z,"well, I have not DL'd it as I do not DL from Anon users, but someone did and it is legit, but it seems to be missing something?  oh well, you can't have everything, good thing I'm not a buddhist then I Couldn't have anything! ;P"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-01T03:40Z,"...Did a little checking with someone who's got a previous collection set of these, and his #6 is missing the cover as well, and he snagged it about 5 or 6 years ago. So it's probably legit as reported above. May actually download it now, just to toss #113 out so it won't piss me off again :P"
,m0rdant,2013-05-01T16:08Z,I've found a copy of the missing page at http://www.comiclink.com/image/2013-2/cerebusscans/cerebus6-1.jpg
,gnarkukl,2013-05-02T07:54Z,I DL'd and checked the whole torrent with Avast and Malwarebytes and it was clean.
