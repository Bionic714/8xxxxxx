From the Infowars web site :: On this Sunday, April 28 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex broadcasts from the road. He pays tribute to Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker, who passed away last week at the age of 78. 

He also covers the latest attack by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow and the latest details on the Boston bombing false flag as the official narrative on the event takes on its final mythological form.

On today's broadcast, Nightly News hosts Jakari Jackson and David Knight co-host from the Austin, Texas command center.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
