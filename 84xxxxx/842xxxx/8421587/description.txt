Uncle Saddam is a satirical yet sobering look inside the world of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. Award winning filmmaker Joel Soler, who is still under U.S. Government protection, risked life and limb to shoot and smuggle this strange and captivating footage out of Iraq. Featuring narration written by Scott Thompson of the Kids in the Hall, and the voice of Wallace Langham ("The Larry Sanders Show"), the film has the feel of an episode of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" spotlighting, as is often the case, one of the world's most hated men.

Full-length interview with Saddam's interior decorator (executed shortly thereafter)

NTSC DVD5 4:3 Runtime: 63m, special features 40m approx.

"Intriguing and bizarre...paints Saddam as the genocidal Jerry Seinfeld. The madness of kings was never this mad." ~ Maureen Dowd, The New York Times

"Wryly amusing, yet dreadfully alarming. A devastating portrait of a megalomanic."
~ Barry Garron, The Hollywood Reporter

"Burn the satanic movie, or you will be dead."
 ~ Anonymous critic who vandalized the home of filmmaker Joel Soler

"If your TV is broken, just put my poster on it." ~ Saddam Hussein

Personally, I would say that this is more like a real-world gangster movie.

This is a real-life satire.

Saddam Hussein was decapitated by hanging, after a farcical trial presided over by his enemies, showing once again, the hypocrisy of humanity. Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi was a much greater man, but was lynched by western-backed al-quaeda terrorists, after they sodomized him with a sharp stick. No trial, just hypocrisy.

Between Saddam Hussein, and the international community who put major sanctions on Iraq (as they are now doing to Iran), resulting in the starvation to death, of countless hundreds of thousands of children, all of our leaders are to blame, as they are genocidal bastards who deserve the same fate as Saddam, if they're lucky.
