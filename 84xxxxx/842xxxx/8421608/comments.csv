Most importantly no music at the end of the torrent I cannot speak for the whole show just the last couple of minutes. I will add another comment if I find some random music playing when I watch it.

,gameofgroans,2013-04-30T06:33Z,"C'mon people, this is legit.

I can't believe Robb and Catelyn die when they get to the Twins. Really looking forward to Episode 9 when this happens. The internet is gonna break.

Jon Snow got some hot wildling ass. Too bad when he finally double-crosses them and returns to the Night's Watch he ends up killing Ygritte. And Jon becomes the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch!!!

Bonus: Joffrey chokes to death at his own wedding. And Tyrion weds Sansa! And Cersei weds Loras! OMG!"
