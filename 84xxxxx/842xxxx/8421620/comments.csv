Downloading now."
,zvucnjak,2013-04-29T12:30Z,"Not ideal, resolution is a bit small, but it's watchable :)"
,dukeford57,2013-04-30T09:35Z,"Best to wait for the full, banned in USA episode 4 which will be airing in most areas of Europe on May 1st. It won't have hard-coded zipperhead lingo subs crawling across the bottom of your screen."
,dukeford57,2013-04-30T09:37Z,This has hardcoded zipperhead subs scrawling across the bottom of the screen. Wait for better version airing May 1st.

,RBishop,2013-05-04T09:36Z,"Downloaded, no audio.  I'll try again."
,Agranopolus,2013-05-06T16:29Z,"Do not download this. Japanese subs.
There are a lot of another options on TPB."

,drarkan,2013-06-09T08:22Z,"Ok I didn't know what the term Zipperhead meant as I have never heard it used ever until now, and well it was originated from the Korean war when the Americans ran over the Korean soldiers leaving tire treads on the corpses. Now how does this relate to Japanese people? I guess racists are not that intelligent so they use what they can to expose how dumb they are..."
