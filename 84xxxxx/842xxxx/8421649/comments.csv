,pocobear,2013-04-29T04:59Z,Whats the difference with this one compared to the last one?
,darkKnighted,2013-04-29T05:00Z,see where it says proper in the name?
,Ray186,2013-04-29T05:07Z,Proper means that there was something wrong with the other one. Glad I waited.
,MadKing101,2013-04-29T05:07Z,"The audio is bugged again?

Why dont you check before uploading? It would take a matter of seconds would it not?"
,mandy12,2013-04-29T05:10Z,plz upload in 160mb to 140mb (480p)

It seems to be an issue with more than just this upload. Anyways what media player are you using? I recommend MPC-HC for many reasons, but also because you can use the numpad + and - keys to adjust audio latency for just these occasions, perfectly offsetting/fixing audio that's out of sync."
,catflusher,2013-04-29T06:42Z,I noticed no oos issues with the 2HD version using the newest version of VLC.
,GavinFace,2013-04-29T11:40Z,"@Jasad. I have no fucking idea what ""'Notes: 2hd goes oos 52 min to end'"" means.  I don't think anyone does. a) because it's technical jargon. b) because it's not written with correct english or grammar. c) this is a fucking piece of shit."

Works very well even on my 48"" wide screen. Audio is in sync... I played it on my pc (windows media player) and TV (which is a low end TV so cheap CPU n such inside) and all in sync and working. Great upload thanks. Anyone having problems need to update either codecs or hardware. It works well, no need to argue as I've been a Computer technician for 14 years. MeWoozy over n out."
,endamckenna,2013-04-30T01:10Z,Just checked the end of the video in Media Player and it seems totally fine!
,xsticks,2013-04-30T02:56Z,"A/V 10, perfect as always. Sound in sync, picture quality great."
