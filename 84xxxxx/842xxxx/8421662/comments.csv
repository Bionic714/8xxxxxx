,sharcklol,2013-04-29T05:20Z,why we cant see the see/peer?
,itdutin,2013-04-29T05:26Z,"Because the torrent was just released and is being flooded, probably can't keep up to live count the seeds."
,Darknesh,2013-04-29T05:34Z,TPB is so broken.. need to fix the comments and seed/leech 
,hakulakuu,2013-04-29T05:37Z,"If i need to upload at 80kbs, but only download at 7kbs....i think i may try another torrent"

,Nightblade88,2013-04-29T18:34Z,"I'm averaging 150kB/s right now, considering that I top out at 200kB/s on well seeded torrents with a low ratio of leechers that is not bad at all.

Big thanks to eztv and all the seeders.
I've left my upload uncapped, going to watch ep3&4 again while I wait.
Aargh! GoT is so friggin' awesome! XD

EDIT:
By the time I finished writing this I've topped out at 200kB/s. Well done community! :)"
,christbi2,2013-04-29T19:10Z,subtitles link??
,gameofgroans,2013-04-30T06:34Z,"C'mon people, this is legit.

I can't believe Robb and Catelyn die when they get to the Twins. Really looking forward to Episode 9 when this happens. The internet is gonna break.

Jon Snow got some hot wildling ass. Too bad when he finally double-crosses them and returns to the Night's Watch he ends up killing Ygritte. And Jon becomes the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch!!!

Bonus: Joffrey chokes to death at his own wedding. And Tyrion weds Sansa! And Cersei weds Loras! OMG!"
,DragonFCP,2013-05-28T20:13Z,thanks
