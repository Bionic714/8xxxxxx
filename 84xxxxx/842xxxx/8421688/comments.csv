But would it kill you to leave on the closing credits, at least until the names of all the actors have been displayed if you don't want to include the copyright and legal mumbo-jumbo at the very end?

Thanks."

The closing music - always a period pop song somehow relevant to the episode - is a very important feature of ""Mad Men,"" and tonight we just gt two seconds of it before the screen went to black.  If I am not mistaken, it was Paul Mauriat's ""Love is Blue"" and would have helped ease one off the high emotions of this episode."
