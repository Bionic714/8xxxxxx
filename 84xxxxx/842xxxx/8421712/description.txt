PsyMP3 is an open-source audio media player for Windows and Unix. Sporting a spartan, keyboard-driven interface, it aims to be a fast and thin player in the face of elephantine monstrosities such as iTunes and Windows Media Player.

This is a alpha-quality preview build. It may have issues.

This is the 32-bit build. If you are running a 64-bit version of Windows, I highly recommend using the 64-bit version - it uses roughly half the CPU.
