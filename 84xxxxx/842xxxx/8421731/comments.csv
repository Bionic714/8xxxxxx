Cheers for the quality Scene.  "
,aiigghht,2013-04-29T09:29Z,"was the only issue with the previous torrent audio sync? the first 2 minutes was fine. Im not watching it immediately though.

If it was just audio sync then its easy fixed, I wont bother downloading again."

,elmanchy,2013-04-30T02:40Z,"I think the problem with the seeders/leechers counts is something about the new servers. I hope it will be fixed soon. By the way, thanks for the torrent..."
