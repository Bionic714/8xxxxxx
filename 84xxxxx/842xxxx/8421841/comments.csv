May be the best copy on TPB(?) At very least it is the only copy I could find with full Hard Subs throughout.

I got a little nervous re. the message from UL'er about 'no longer doing subs because its tiring'..thought maybe the subs would 'stop' halfway through...or something..but I guess that message is for Future Uploads and not this one as Subs continue flawlessly throughout.

So thanks..in my opinion a perfect 'collectible' file."
