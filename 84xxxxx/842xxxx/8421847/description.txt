"Campfires is a one man band ΓÇô Jeff Walls ΓÇô and this is his debut under the moniker The production is fiercely lo-fi ΓÇô the short sharp bursts of energy could be likened to post-punk ΓÇô though the melody drifts a good fifteen years further back. What with its scratchy rhythm guitars and 60s vintage snapshot of psychedelic sunshine; CampfireΓÇÖs debut is soaked with colours from the past. Yet however heavy the debt may be the sound travels light and easy ΓÇô rambling through my sub-conscious with a carefree disposition and a bag full of friendly hooks.

Moments like title track Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Fortune Teller standout with treble-heavy guitars and drifting melody. Meanwhile Glass Arrows feels like a nod to The Small Faces and Bayonet bends and rambles with a distorted, home-production charm. You do start to wonder if Walls recorded this with a release in mind ΓÇô it all goes down so damn easy.

This is a record without expectation and unconcerned with judgement ΓÇô and such freedom has allowed Walls to compile a set of tracks that are never short of infectious and consistently engaging."
