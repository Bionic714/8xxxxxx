Produced by Wayne and his longtime producer/collaborator Lloyd Maines (Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Dixie Chicks, Joe Ely), Ride further cements Wayne's life-long calling ["All I want to do is play the Joints 'til the day I die"&gt; as a modern-day traditionalist through his signature mΓÇÜlange of roadhouse blues, hepcat boogie, rockabilly, and juke joint swing. As Hank III once said, "Wayne Hancock has more Hank Sr. in him than either I or Hank Williams Jr. He is the real deal." Ride is built on a vibe that is at once more direct and personal than those of his previous Bloodshot releases Viper of Melody (2009), Tulsa (2006), Swing Time (2003), and A-Town Blues (2001). "The album is an organic reaction to life's challenges ... these are not sad songs," the South TX native said of his 8th overall album and 5th for Bloodshot.
