,Ronalds550,2013-04-29T16:15Z,Steady download - 26% @ 200kb/s manageable but still slow. Fastest torrent for this download I've seen so far.
,gameofgroans,2013-04-29T16:26Z,"C'mon people, this is legit.

I can't believe Robb and Catelyn die when they get to the Twins. Really looking forward to Episode 9 when this happens. The internet is gonna break.

Bonus: Joffrey chokes to death at his own wedding. And Tyrion weds Sansa! OMG!"

,tetnem,2013-04-29T17:12Z,"@gameofgroans 
Stop spoiling you faggot!!!!!!!!! Go and fuck your self!! Is it really necessary to spoil everything to someone who haven't watched the episode yet? Are you brain dead or something?????!!"

,Volantis,2013-05-01T23:00Z,"@Pure1080p: Maybe you should watch the episode first before you give out the foul spoilers! 
Though, loved the lil girl singing while the ending credit rolls.

[T],stevekasian,2013-05-02T12:46Z,Great episode!!! Be sure to watch closely when Joffrey loses his head - when it rolls to a stop you'll notice his eyes moving back and forth. Gross!

,PSOHart,2013-05-02T23:01Z,"Awesome release as usual.
But some problems occurs since the S3, it seems like the video miss some frames, and i miss 1 or 2 sec of video every 40 sec
I'm using MediaPlayer with CCCP, and VLC can't handle it, any tips ?"
,Zozur,2013-05-05T11:08Z,"I see slight lighting flashes in the last scene where the Lannisters are having a meeting. Otherwise, a/v 10/10.

Thank you, ez."
,outsajder,2013-05-13T19:34Z,"@gameofgroans

Thanks a lot for the spoiler you ashole."
,Archon12,2013-05-26T23:50Z,"Sounds like another asshat had to ruin it for everyone. Fortunately I didn't read the spoiler (on this torrent @ least), just everyone's admonitions towards him. With which I agree, of course, but as someone who reads through the comments for the SOLE purpose of ascertaining the A/V quality of the torrent, I really can't help wondering why they got rid of the +/- quality scoring system at the top. No offense to any of my fellow pirates, but the comments are almost completely useless in this regard. It's becoming just as common to find a spoiler in the comments as finding any meaningful appraisal of the A/V quality. And that's some bullshit. I'll never complain about getting stuff for free, but why would they get rid of something that only made TPB better and more useful? Surely I'm not the only one who used the Quality scores...am I??
TL;DR: Bring back the Quality +/- scoring system!!!"
