AlessiΓÇÖs Ark, the vessel for singer-songwriter Alessi Laurent-MarkeΓÇÖs precocious talent, now has a third studio album with the release of The Still Life. The blossoming West London artist has yet to celebrate her 23rd birthday, but Laurent-MarkeΓÇÖs voice is striking, capable of simultaneous seduction and subversion. The singer would be a shoe-in for the kind of outwardly puzzled, yet knowing heroine you might find in a David Lynch work.
While her latest shares some commonality with its predecessors, especially her previous one, Time Travel, ArkΓÇÖs sonic palette has broadened to encompass both ethnic instruments and contemporary sound effects. Still, ArkΓÇÖs songs are concise, straight pitches. On the short opening track, ΓÇ£Tin SmithingΓÇ¥, her lyrics run into each other against a backcloth of chopping guitar and kalimba so that her voice is almost absorbed into the soundtrack. ItΓÇÖs followed by the languid ΓÇ£Veins Are BlueΓÇ¥, offering up a far more direct take on relationship fall-out, opening with: ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm doing exactly as I please / Falling but this time not grazing my kneesΓÇ¥.

With its sampled beats and odd discordant flurries, ΓÇ£The RainΓÇ¥ captures an even greater sense that AlessiΓÇÖs Ark has moved forward sound-wise. Lyrically the song meshes notions of love and nature into one entity while the vocal harmonies in the choruses add real distinction. As you mine deeper into the album, a surprising variety of styles are revealed from the circus swing of ΓÇ£Big DipperΓÇ¥ to the bar room goodtime (ΓÇ£MoneyΓÇ¥) and even a ghostly cover of The NationalΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Afraid of EveryoneΓÇ¥.

Stand out ΓÇ£Sans BalanceΓÇ¥ begins as a more conventional folk song before the singer throws in a verse in French and later indulges us with a breath-stopping middle eight. ItΓÇÖs simply exquisite. Laurent-Marke sings ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm told thereΓÇÖs good things IΓÇÖve done / When youΓÇÖre me you remember noneΓÇ¥ on a teasingly brief ΓÇ£The Good SongΓÇ¥. Well, she ought to remember this record and for good.
