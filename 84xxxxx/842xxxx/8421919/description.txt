This book addresses many challenging topics related to the NoC research area. It starts by studying 3D NoC architectures and progresses to a discussion of NoC resource allocation, processor traffic modeling, and formal verification. NoC protocols are examined at different layers of abstraction. Also, several emerging research issues in NoC are highlighted in this book, such as NoC Quality of Service (QoS), testing and verification methodologies, NoC security requirements, and real-time monitoring. The book also tackles power and energy issues in NoC-based designs, as power constraints are currently considered among the bottlenecks that limit embedding more processing elements on a single chip.
