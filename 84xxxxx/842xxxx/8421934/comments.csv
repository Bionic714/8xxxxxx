,cancab,2013-04-29T21:10Z,tpb has been acting very strange (since about saturday)....been getting security warnings when trying acess .se and it keeps going to .is....anyone who has information on whats up..it would be appreciated
,Dabibsta,2013-04-30T04:37Z,"I thought about the issues that have been happening and I found it pretty easy to see that they are obviously in the process of switching servers or maybe using others while fixing main .. something to that extent considering the .is change which .se is sweden so Islam? Just guessing , make sense ? "
,cancab,2013-04-30T19:49Z,"hey thanks for the reply Dabibsta
I notice now tpb is using .sx...and the security warnings I was getting no longer appear........
they are most like just switching severs.........
still makes me nervous though I'm not that teck savy and the though of losing the bay is scary as heck to me!"
