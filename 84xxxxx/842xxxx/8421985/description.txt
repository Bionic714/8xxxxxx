Starring Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, Dennis Hopper, Susan Strasberg

SOUNDTRACK BY THE GRATEFUL DEAD
RECORDED LIVE IN EUREKA AND PORTLAND, JAN/FEB 1968

English Subtitles hardcoded so you can follow the story.

Ripped from MGM DVD as MPEG-2, then converted to MPEG-4 after I replaced the original soundtrack with the Grateful Dead!

MPEG-4 AVC encoded via Nero Digital
AAC-LC 256 kbs

This film is worth seeing in its original form, it's actually very good.  Here I am using the film as background for the Grateful Dead shows, so it functions as a "music video."  The audio is high quality, hardly inferior to the CD source.

This "Trip" is really groovy & I hope everyone enjoys it.
