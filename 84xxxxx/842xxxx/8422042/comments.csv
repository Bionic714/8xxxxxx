,stinson33,2013-04-29T09:59Z,ty bro.. u knw i hav been waiting for this!!
,Germanikus,2013-04-29T10:59Z,"Mhm, is it just me? All torrents on game of thrones s03e05 show me 0/0 seeders/leechers xD"
,DogTop,2013-04-29T11:31Z,"@Germanikus - it's not just you, friend - I'm getting the same negative results.  Something is very fishy here - this is very different than usual."
,DogTop,2013-04-29T12:27Z,"Follow up on the torrent - This works perfectly so far.  Took a chance and downloaded - watching now.  So far, so good."
,blasheris,2013-04-29T14:13Z,"Just got finished E04, couldn't find a proper stream online. Thanks  uploader, will seed until the new episode. "
,Germanikus,2013-04-29T15:06Z,"@DogTop - 
Well, since utorrent wont show any peers and the dl-rate is on 20kb/s for me whilst peerblock is running, I guess, I'll wait for a stream :D"
,pRo_Peter,2013-04-29T18:40Z,"This is a legit copy. I have downloaded it and it is just like the other from this same uploader. I think the problem is with the site. When I sort by seeders, it comes up as the second one. Whatever the problem, its fine. Took me like 15 minutes"
[T],Djofullinn,2013-04-29T19:42Z,"True. Everything is swell, except all recent torrents are at 0/0 s/l. They download and seed fine though. Thanx uploader."
,bital,2013-04-29T23:59Z,"its from baiscope can, its always legit :D"
,pRo_Peter,2013-04-30T03:51Z,"Yeah, I've notice the 0/0 on most of the recent uploads no matter if its video, apps, or whatever. But the error seems just limited to what the site displays. It is seeded and I watched the entire episode. Great as always."
[T],Djofullinn,2013-04-30T04:37Z,"It is resolving as we speak.

Thanks again baiscope for your splendid work."
,tdktbbt,2013-05-01T03:39Z,"Awesome quality again by Baiscope..
Thanks..
Will be waiting every week for your upload of GOT :)"
,BrenZBoy,2013-05-08T17:23Z,"GUYS, COULD YOU PLEASE SEED..."
