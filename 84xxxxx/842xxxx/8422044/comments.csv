,mentallyours,2013-04-29T09:24Z,": Paul Pierce scored 29 points, helping the Boston Celtics withstand a furious second half comeback by the New York Knicks and escape with a 97-90 overtime win. Carmelo Anthony scored a game-high 36 points for the Knicks, who were looking for a 4-0 sweep in the first round series, but fell short after rallying from a 20-point second half deficit. The hero? Jason Terry, who scored nine of his 18 points in the overtime period to carry Boston to the win. Jeff Green added 26 points for the hosts, who now trail 3-1 in the best-of-seven series.
