Our next FCUP series is 'Grimjack'. Wikipedia says:

Grimjack is the main character of a comic book originally published by First Comics. 
'Grimjack', the street name of John Gaunt, is a sword-for-hire, ex-paramilitary, war veteran and former child gladiator. He operates from Munden's Bar in the Pit, a slum area of Cynosure, a pan-dimensional city to which all dimensions connect.

John Ostrander and Timothy Truman are credited as co-creators of the character, although Ostrander had been developing Grimjack with artist Lenin Delsol before Truman's arrival on the project according to Ostrander's own text piece in Grimjack #75. In that same essay, the writer also revealed having initially conceived the character to be the star of a series of prose stories, set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.

Grimjack began as a backup feature in issue 10 of the comic book Starslayer. The Grimjack backup story was very popular with the readers of Starslayer, and First Comics decided to give the character his own title. The GrimJack back-up story ran from issue 10 to 17. Grimjack guest-starred in the main Starslayer story in issue 18, in July 1984. Grimjack #1 was published in August 1984, and ran until issue #81, in April 1991. In 1990, First published Demon Knight, a stand-alone graphic novel. Two later mini-series were produced for IDW, which are also included here.
