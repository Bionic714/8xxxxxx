Nat Adderley - 1958 - Branching Out (1993)
Cornetist Nat Adderley's debut for Riverside (reissued on CD in the OJC series) was recorded about a year before he permanently rejoined his brother Cannonball Adderley's Quintet. Teamed with tenor-saxophonist Johnny Griffin and the Three Sounds (the popular soul jazz rhythm section comprised of pianist Gene Harris, bassist Andy Simpkins and drummer Bill Dowdy), Nat is in excellent form on such tunes as "Well You Needn't," "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" and "I Never Knew" in addition to two of his lesser-known originals. Adderley and Griffin made for an exciting frontline. (AllMusic)
