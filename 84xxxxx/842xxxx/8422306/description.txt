Kosteniuk (born April 23, 1984 in Perm) learned to play chess at the age of five after being taught by her father. She has a younger sister named Oxana, who is a FIDE master level chess player.
In 2001, at the age of 17, she reached the final of the World Women's Chess Championship, but was defeated by Zhu Chen. Three years later, she became European women's champion by winning the tournament in Dresden, Germany. She also won the 2005 Russian Women's Championship, held in Samara, Russia.. In August 2006, she became the first Chess960 women's world champion after beating Germany's top female player Elisabeth Pähtz. She defended that title successfully in 2008 by beating Kateryna Lahno. However, her greatest success so far has been to win the Women's World Chess Championship 2008, beating in the final the young Chinese prodigy Hou Yifan.
In November 2004, she was awarded the International Grandmaster title, becoming the tenth woman to receive the highest title of the World Chess Federation, FIDE. Before that, she had also obtained the titles of Woman Grandmaster and International Master.
