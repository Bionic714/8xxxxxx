,shawnmurthy,2013-04-29T12:35Z,mp4 plays on ps3 and xbox bro i have played it before
,The1stRule,2013-04-29T13:22Z,Audio is better (Just going by the sample) but still low. 5/10 
,Venturai,2013-04-29T13:28Z,This isn't better audio. You can hear the same voices in the background as it's starting.
,gearbox27,2013-04-29T13:34Z,wait for a better copy its shite
,gearbox27,2013-04-29T13:40Z,crap
,kellogg9,2013-04-29T13:57Z,"Audio is still bad but it is a tad better.  I'd say about 10% better from other releases.

And this is after my working with VLC to improve it.  I think i will stick with AQOS version since i had better success in audio tweaks via VLC with it than this release."
