I wonder if Terry Carr's later Universe anthology series took its name intentionally from this magazine?"
,Ewedewno,2013-04-30T00:37Z,"Nope, I just have the one issue - I'm a big Sturgeon fan, and this is the only issue of Universe he published in, as well as probably one of the bigger collector's items of the stuff he published (given its notoriety at the time, though he rarely shied from controversy).

It was pretty quickly downhill for this magazine. Asimov, Judith Merril, Randall Garrett, and L. Sprague de Camp had a few stories between them in the first several issues, but the overall quality dropped off pretty quickly, and pretty much all of the big names were gone by the last two issues.

It was certainly no Galaxy or Astounding. Man, I wish someone would put up some more Astounding scans! (Most issues of Galaxy can be found on the Internet Archive, and a few issues of Astounding are in a pulp magazine torrent I found, but it's missing quite a lot of notable stories - hell, it's even missing the infamous Dianetics issue!)"
[T],pharmakate,2013-05-03T23:11Z,"For Astrounding, did you try the pbscans yahoo group? I don't collect these, so I can't say exactly what's there, but someone just posted Astounding for October 1944. I bet there are other issues available.

The quality of your scan here is outstanding. Thanks."
,Ewedewno,2013-05-18T22:50Z,"Thanks for the tip and for the compliment.

There are indeed several magazines I don't have scans of that I found on this group, including the Astounding with Sturgeon's ""Microcosmic God"".

The touch-up work on this was pretty insane - for the black and white pages, it was mostly just a matter of making it greyscale, upping the contrast just to the point where most of the background was pure white, then touching up some splotches. The color pages were much more involved - I ended up adjusting curves in Photoshop to make it at least a good bit LESS yellow, then using my previous contrast setting, then applying custom palettes (one for red pages, and another for blue), THEN coming up with some presets to adjust the hue further to make the reds and blues look a little more like they should have had the pages been white.

It also beat up the magazine pretty good, though that was probably worth it to preserve it for posterity."
