First Issue (June, 1953) of /Universe/, which ran for ten issues until March 1955

This issue (and this magazine as a whole!) is most notable for the Theodore Sturgeon story "The World Well Lost," a VERY early example of a sympathetic portrayal of homosexuality in science fiction, which the /Wesleyan Anthology of Science Fiction/ says "was rejected by the well-known sf digests, appearing instead in Chicago-based /Universe SF/ [this torrent]"

According to Sturgeon himself, "I once wrote a fairly vivid story about a man being unfaithful to his wife and no one made any scandalous remarks about me. I then wrote a specific kind of narrative about a woman being unfaithful to her husband and nobody had anything scandalous to say about my wife. But I wrote an empathetic sort of tale about some homosexuals and my mailbox filled up with cards drenched with scent and letters written in purple ink with green capitals."

Anyway, the issue also includes other short fiction from Hugo winners Robert Bloch, Murray Leinster, and Mark Clifton, among others.

I include pdfs of both my original scans and a cleaned-up, high-contrast version that is probably easier to read and to print.
