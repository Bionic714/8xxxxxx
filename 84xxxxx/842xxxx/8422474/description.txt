Soft Pop Lovers, this playlist definitely brings you somewhere. Some pieces simply will blow you away, as long as it goes with ease :) It just must be one of my best playlists. Much attention was spent on play sequence. Music can support and break each other. Volume, rhythm and sphere too. Its a pity its in MP3.... Enjoy,
