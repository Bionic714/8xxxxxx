Many thanks for the wonderful collection you have been putting up here but, don't you find it strange to find 0 seeds in almost all of your postings?

You don't seed long enough for people to finish leeching and start seeding! I've been trying to get Green for danger and The prisoner since you posted. One was left at 92% and the other at 81%. 

You should seed until you have at least 3/4 seeders and only then move to a new project.

If you leave everything unseeded it's a little bit of a waste of your time and effort wouldn't you agree?"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T15:43Z,@kaminer2 I'm going to re-upload those soon.

@ SteelerJ17 .... 

There has to be a reason why you stop the seeding 
too early in so many of your DVD Torrents

You're one of the good guys here at The Pirate Bay, 
so i know that you dont do this on purpose.

=============================
In your client uTorrent you can take a look at all downloaders in every Torrent you're seeding .... !
( I guess you know that, but if not .... ( ? ) .... )

Here is the way to find that info in your client uTorrent :

01) .... In uTorrent go up on the left side and Click .... ""Options""

02) .... Put a checkmark on .... ""Show Detailed Info""

03) .... In that ""Detailed Info Bar"" click on .... ""Peers""

Now you can go up to all your uploaded DVD's, and choose which one you wanna 
take a closer look at. ( Exactly the downloaders, and their percent ).
==============================

Don't trust the numbers presented in different places when it comes to ""seeders"".
They are many times totally ""deadwrong"" .... ( Sorry to say ) ....

Finally .... 
Your opinions about the ""Hit and Run - Club"" here at The Pirate Bay .... 
I couldn't agree more .... !"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T18:13Z,@Agentbay Thank a lot! I'm learning how everything works. I have a question. When it is a good time to stop seeding a torrent? And difference between peers and swarms?
,Agentbay,2013-04-29T19:10Z,"
@ SteelerJ17

If you try to reach at least 5-6 seeders ( 100 percent downloaders ) that would be great.

====================================
peers = Each person (or more exact ""each computer"" ) downloading.
swarm = ALL People (or more exact ""all computers"" ) connected to a single torrent.
( Of course when a ""peer"" reach 100 percent, he directly becomes a ""seed"" )

====================================
By the way .... :

In client uTorrent go up to the left and click on .... ""Help""

Then click on .... ""uTorrent Help"" 

( Or simply use ""F1"" on your keyboard )

That's a pretty massive ""Know How"" file 
hidden in your uTorrent-program.

/ It will kill you, LOL ....
====================================="
,kaminer2,2013-04-29T20:16Z,"Many thanks again. If you safe your torrent file you don't have to re-up the files, just keep them in the same directory where you had them the first time :)

Agentbay could probably explain this a lot better"
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T20:21Z,@Agentbay Okay. It seems since I lower the piece size to 2048kb. People been getting my torrents quicker which is good. I think I was burned out of all the requests that I was getting. It was too much for me. Now I can focus on uploading torrents that I feel that people will like. 
,SteelerJ17,2013-04-29T20:24Z,@kaminer2 I have some good Criterion's coming in soon. Some of them are out of print. Agentbay has been very helpful as you are too. I'm learning a lot. I want to be the best uploader on TPB
