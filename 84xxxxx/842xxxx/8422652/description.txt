This accessible and valuable introduction to caring for a child with autism is an ideal resource for teachers and members of a child with autism's immediate and extended family. In clear and simple language, with many illustrations, the authors tackle commons problems experienced in everyday routines such as eating, sleeping and going to the toilet, as well as how to cope with aggression and tantrums, preoccupations and compulsions and how to enable better communication and socialising. Step-by-step, the authors consider why each problem may be happening and suggest a number of ways solutions.
