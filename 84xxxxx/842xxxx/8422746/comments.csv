==========================

1. Mount .ISO using e.g. PowerISO and run setup (Application) or extract contents of .ISO using e.g. WinRAR or 7zip and run setup (Application).
2. Once installed, disable A/V and/or firewall and run Microsoft Toolkit.exe
3. Click on the Microsoft Office TAB (Bottom right of Toolkit, 1st of the 3 TABS).
4. Now click on the Activation TAB, make sure AutoKMS is selected from the drop down menu and then click on Activate.

If Office is not activated on the first try, you may need to run the above activation procedure a couple of times until product is activated.

ENJOY AND SEED!!!

,user1197,2013-05-02T18:37Z,Is this safe to use with a legit copy of winodws 8? Does it modify the activation?

Yes it's  safe. Your activating the software not the operating system."

,josdso,2013-05-04T08:50Z,"Please refer my previous comment...I re-tried with a different method.

1. In the Activation Tab, select KMS Server Service and Install/Activate. Windows popped up a message stating that firewall has blocked some features. Click on Allow Access.
2. Then select  AutoKMS and Activate. 

It worked and the office got activated..

Thanks a lot. "

,PTSpawn,2013-05-07T05:16Z,"Does anyone happen to know if you can sign in to the applications so that you are connected through the cloud?  I'm not sure if the Volume License is just for reg or if it actually allows you to sign in to your account (to get rid of the ""Sign in to get the most out of Office"" prompt in the top right corner of the application and transfer files between different locations)?"

And the thing updated too! About 35 Office updates in Windows Updater. After the restart I used the activator again, just in case.
