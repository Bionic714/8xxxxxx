In 2001, Texas singer/songwriters Pat Green and Cory Morrow put their own musical spin on a collection of solid tunes with Songs We Wish WeΓÇÖd Written. Nearly a dozen years later, theyΓÇÖve teamed again to pay tribute to an assortment of gifted songwriters from various musical genres.

They completely reshape Tom Petty and the HeartbreakersΓÇÖ mid-tempo rocker ΓÇ£Even the LosersΓÇ¥ into a slow-burning piano ballad. While Warren HaynesΓÇÖ ΓÇ£SoulshineΓÇ¥ has been cut by two bands heΓÇÖs associated withΓÇöThe Allman Brothers Band and GovΓÇÖt MuleΓÇöPat turns in a particularly soulful performance on the tune, aided by Monte Montgomery on vocals and some blistering guitar licks.

Occasionally, the original artist is invited to help re-record a tune. Pat pairs with Collective Soul lead singer Ed Roland for a stripped-down, country-tinged version of the bandΓÇÖs ΓÇ£The World I Know,ΓÇ¥ and trades lines with Aaron Lee Tasjan on AaronΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Streets of Galilee.ΓÇ¥

Pat and Cory round out the album with honorable takes on songs from fellow Texas songwriters Joe Ely (ΓÇ£All Just to Get to YouΓÇ¥), Jon Randall (ΓÇ£AustinΓÇ¥) and Lyle Lovett (ΓÇ£If I Had a BoatΓÇ¥).
