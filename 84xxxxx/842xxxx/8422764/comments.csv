If you use RssReader then copy this to ""My feeds"": 

http://rss.thepiratebay.sx/user/acb357ddd9a0e1461108ab0ca9c1f5cb

and you will see my uploads when it comes on the page.

Or

If you want to download immediately when they are uploaded, go into uTorrent and add feeds and make settings to download.



Greetings Realuploads "
