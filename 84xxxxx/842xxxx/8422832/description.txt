This Is A combination of 1,100 + Scripts for Arma 2 or Arma 2 AO or Arma 2 CO that I have searched the web in search for some laughable scripts :') ... you will see haha. With a nice Menu system, that took ages to set up..
The weapons and vehicles take up most of these scripts..

*IMPORTANT* = Some scripts will not work! Some will only work on Arma 2 CO/OA, Some scripts will stuff up other scripts eg; don't use ESP script, unless you want to not be able to use GOD Mode or invisible!

**DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER/FOLDERS/CONTENTS!**
**DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FOLDER/FOLDERS/CONTENTS!**

HOW TO USE :

The only script you will have to run is "Launcher.sqf"
I use Cheat Engine, so this is what the String/Code looks like..

First Scan =

private ["_dummy"]; _dummy = [_this,"onload"] execVM "cauiscriptsdedicatedServerInterface.sqf";

Change too =

private ["_dummy"]; _dummy = [_this,"onload"] execVM "RUNLauncher.sqf";

Than close cheat engine after that! And it will work even if you leave that server.
Until you restart your ARMA 2, than you will need to run the script

To run the script once on a server hold "CONTROL" Than press "P"
Or 
Click "M" and go to "Server Controls" or whatever the admin panel is called..
