The world of bugs normally passes beneath our notice,
yet shrink yourself to their size, and see them and
youâ™ll enter a world youâ™d never believe existed.
Big Bugs uses specially developed technology to
take the viewer on a global journey, from Mexico
and the rainforests of Asia to our own backyards.
