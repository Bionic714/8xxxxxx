,marvelnerd76,2013-04-29T19:03Z,Wow I didn't expect you to find this so quickly. I'm the happiest little boy on the planet right now! I will seed the heck out of this. Thank you my good man. You truly are the best!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T19:59Z,"coincidentally, some guy on bolt.cd was posting buttloads of complete x-men miniseries, and series that didn't last long, late friday night. if i hadn't been doing so much this weekend, it would've taken about an hour.  ;-)

also have decided to download and post x-men: the early years (1994-95) reprints along with the x-men classic reprints, just f.y.i."
,Nightwing1945,2013-04-29T20:17Z,"Another awesome up, thanks STF, looking forward to more good stuff...

....like.....IDW's Joe Palooka?  I have no idea if this series is popular enough to be scanned or not, but I haven't had any luck finding it.  If you can, great; if not, so be it....thanks. "
