[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-29T19:48Z,i had no idea about this character! thanks Mothra67
,Mothra67,2013-04-30T06:20Z,"Glad you guys like it, and STF, I am happy to see this torrent surprised even you!  ;P"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-01T03:36Z,"...Bill Everett was one of the real talents of the Golden Age, and one who for a very brief time gave Marvel's Silver Age a Namor who was even a more interesting character than he was as a popular anti-hero when he created Namor just prior to WWII. His death was a tragic loss to the industry at the time, and it would have been interesting to see his take on ""Tomb of Dracula"" had he lived, to say the least.

...If you collect comics in any way, shape or form, you'll do yourself good to at the minimum to read this Wikipedia article on Bill:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Everett

...It's a rare comics wiki article where the facts haven't been either perverted or glossed over, save for the section regarding his death. Bill had contracted tuberculosis when he was a kid, and developed complications later in his life that, combined with alcoholism and the general lack of medical insurance/security that 99% of the comics industry had in those days - and only about 19% today have managed to get even basic health coverage from the publishers, and most of those are big-wig dipshits like Didio, Lee, Harass (sic), Quesada and the editorial types - wound up burning him out just as he was getting his professional and creative candles lit. I've seen some of the pencils for his last few works, and even with illness kicking his butt quicker than you can say ""Okay, Mr. Death, John Wayne's gone to the set. The coast is clear!"".

Steal this torrent, read Bill Everett in his first prime, and then seed it. Remember, SEEDING IS LIFE!

Oh, and excellent find, Mothra. Where's you come across these? "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T05:22Z,"either one of you fellows read ""fire and water"" by blake bell, about everett and his career in comics? i have it but haven't taken the time to read it yet."
,Mothra67,2013-05-01T06:25Z,"ChingaTuu, That article made me cry.  it pisses me off how badly these creative geniuses got treated.  Not just Him, but Kirby, Ditko, the team behind supoerman, the list goes on and on.  Frank miller put up a good fight for artists writers and so did a few others, but it isn't enough!

I got this from the same place I get all my GA comics, the digital comics museum!  check it out!

STF, I have not read that!  I didn't even know there was a book out on Bill, I will have to check around for it for sure!"
