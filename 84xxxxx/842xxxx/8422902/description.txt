A very cool creation by Bill Everett.  If you don't know who that is, he created Marvel's Sub Mariner.

This Character Lapsed into Public Domain till Alex Ross Scooped him up and did his project Superpowers thang!

Harry Thurston, a young chemical engineer, accidentally compounded a formula to convert human flesh and blood into water. A huge container of this remarkable solution was spilled and splashed over Bob Blake, Harry's friend, causing him to disintegrate and become a pool of water on the laboratory floor! Promptly, an antidote was concocted, and with the aid of this, Bob regained his natural form. He then discovered that he could control this phenomenal change merely by the power of thought.

Donning aviator goggles and tights left over from a costume party, he took on the identity of Hydroman to battle an army of "Oriental" invaders. He discovered that it was in fact run by Nazi fifth columnists.

In Heroic Comics #2, his pal Harry had invented a fabric "made of translite - it's transparent, like cellophane, but tough - nothing can penetrate it - not even bullets". Hydroman had a suit made of this material.

Hydroman had a sidekick named Rainbow Boy until he went on to be a solo hero.
