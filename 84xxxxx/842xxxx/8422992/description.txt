Wasted by Heroin and Crack & Mums using - Complete ep1-4
--------------------------------------------------------


Wasted is a four-part series that looks at the impacts of drug use on individuals, families and society. Each details the stories of young people who are either currently dependent on drugs or who have a history of drug taking. 
 The series begins with cocaine addiction, then moves through the use of heroin and cannabis, before finishing with a look at the lives of children who have drug-using parents. 
 This is a hard-hitting and at times disturbing insight into how drug use can ruin lives, although there are also the stories of those who have overcome addiction to get their lives back on track.



The two people in this programme came to be addicted to heroin in quite different ways, and by the end of the film find themselves in quite different places. April, aged 20, is pregnant, a former heroin addict and now dependant on methadone. She and her mother Sherrie talk about their experiences of April's drug use. By the end of the programme, they face a much more positive future.
 Ian, aged 19, was orphaned at 5 and then went into care. He began using drugs at a very early age, and is now addicted to heroin, crack and methadone. Ian lives in a hostel and appears to have no family, friends or support. By the end of the film, his future looks bleak.
