,bofadhel,2013-04-29T21:16Z,which version has better video quality 1080p or 1080i? the 1080i version has a bigger size
,pm3003,2013-04-30T08:32Z,"The two have approximately the same quality in theory. I downloaded the 1080i yesterday and I was slightly disappointed (but also because I couldn't get VLC to render it properly).

1080i is interlaced, it's likle a TV format. The file should be smaller and also the quality (1 frame = 1/2 screen to put it simply) , but it also had (I think) a higher framerate (app 30 fps)."
