Game of Thrones - Season 3 - Episode 5 (WEB-DL - 1080p)
-------------------------------------------------------

Duplicity and treachery... nobility and honor... conquest and triumph... and,
of course, dragons. It's 'Game' on for Season 3 of this epic, Emmy(R)-winning
HBO series based on the bestselling book series by George R.R. Martin.
In Season 3, family and loyalty are the overarching themes as many critical
storylines from the first two seasons come to a brutal head. Meanwhile, the
Lannisters maintain their hold on King's Landing, though stirrings in the
North threaten to alter the balance of power; Robb Stark, King of the North,
faces a major calamity as he tries to build on his victories; a massive army
of wildlings led by Mance Rayder (Ciaran Hinds) march for the Wall; and Daenerys
Targaryen -- reunited with her dragons -- attempts to raise an army in her quest
for the Iron Throne.

Produced by Home Box Office (HBO).
