,room237,2013-04-29T19:54Z,"File has watermarks and no ending, missing about 20 minutes from final film."
,Captain_Ketchup,2013-04-29T21:53Z,Unwatchable. Just like niggers playing baseball
,professorjpj,2013-04-29T21:58Z,I dont understand.. WHY even release the movie here with a MISSING ENDING! No point..  Does it just not have the CREDITS? Is that what you mean?
,bredred,2013-04-29T23:23Z,"@professor...it's missing the last 11 min of the movie, last 18min if you count credits at the end."
,professorjpj,2013-04-30T00:14Z,"Why release it without the whole movie? I dont get it? Cant someone SPLICE the ending in from a GOOD cam version? If I knew how, Id do it myself..."
,room237,2013-04-30T02:28Z,Quit your whining...good films always leave you hanging...this one just a bit more.
,8257634,2013-04-30T04:28Z,"Haha, Captain_Ketchup is a douche... like you didn't already know :)"
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-04-30T14:00Z,"One of the methods the MPAA is using to fight piracy is being the first to release a pirated movie, but in TERRIBLE quality. This is designed to discourage people from even bothering to pirate. 

We saw it with Oblivion with all the watermarks in the center of the screen.

We saw it with the first release of  42 with the shaky cam.

Now we see it here.

42 has been released in certain parts of Asia as of yesterday. The MPAA knows this. So what do they do, release a BAD copy. Hundreds of thousands download the BAD copy. Soon people will not even bother downloading. "
