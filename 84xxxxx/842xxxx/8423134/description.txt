Book Description

With Food, photographer Mary McCartney brings us easy, family-friendly meat-free dishes that will appeal to everyoneΓÇöincluding carnivores. And they're all presented in gorgeous pictures taken by Mary herself, along with personal stories and photos old and new.

Inspired by her mother's recipes, McCartney has whipped up creative, comforting, uncomplicated, and delicious meals that will encourage home cooks to think vegetarian.

They range from savory Asparagus Summer Tart and a no-meat Shepherd's Pie to family favorites, including Lemon Drizzle Cake and Arty's Chocolate Chip Cookies.

This is good, wholesome fare, cooked well and with ease, meant for family and friends to share. And Mary's unique bold and beautifully illuminated images are as irresistible as her food.
