,aetnh,2013-05-01T08:59Z,"That audio hiss can be fixed in VLC by going to ""Tools"", then ""Effects and Filters"" on the defatul tab (""Audio Effects"") Select BOTH ""Enable"" and ""2 Pass""
and set the ""Preset"" to ""Live"". 

Bumps that audio up a digit on this one :)"
,krimsonater,2013-05-01T21:58Z,"this audio is so bad, I couldn't even understand what the hell was being said, over half the time. I don't know why anyone would rate audio 7, more like 2, video is really good, which made it all the more disappointing."
[V],HeroMaster,2013-05-02T05:29Z,"@krimsonater The audio is re-work on this version, as you will not find it on other releases just in MiLLENiUM edition, this is best one out there, as the official release is still hanging in the balance. "
,sperry22,2013-05-02T07:41Z,"PEOPLE!!!!!! FOLLOW @aetnh instructions but you must also put the 12k bar all the way down!!! makes the audio much clearer with very little fuzz! 

ENJOY"
,iamlaze,2013-05-02T18:34Z,"A5-V6-M5
AUDIO compared to others, is very much better than all of them. Good cam to watch, also not that a few seconds was cut out, i think maybe to keep the audio in sync. PLEASE SEED PPL dont be STINGY!!!"
,tflagger997,2013-05-03T03:54Z,"This should only be about 500MB at this resolution with this audio bitrate.  MiLLENiUM got the audio a little better, but rushed the encode."
,Mrpell,2013-05-03T07:20Z,Or why don't we all just wait until better and PROPER cam rips are done in the USA starting on and after May 3rd instead of having to make do with this torrent?
,pxpierre,2013-05-03T09:52Z,"Thank you HeroMaster & seeders.

A/V8 for a cam. M3 or 9 if you are 12 or under."
,korovjov0,2013-05-03T15:59Z,"Way to go Hungary!
Magyar tengerre magyar kalózokat ;)"
,bfldworker,2013-05-04T05:22Z,"I have to be honest, I just saw Iron Man 3 in IMAX 3D, and I have to say that with the Cams I have seen of this movie you miss out on A LOT of detail that you would normally see in a theater or on DVD. IF you can afford it go see this movie at a theater, if you can't then a very good quality CAM is for you. Just my 2 cents"
,Flatulent,2013-05-04T13:18Z,"Quality isn't that great, don't know why everyone says it is.

A-4
V-5
at best."
,wolfboy703,2013-05-05T08:00Z,unwatchable.  the audio is so bad. V=4 A=1
,weavermage,2013-05-05T10:24Z,"A: 7, could hear most things
V: 7, a lot like watching an old vhs

Does not have the after credits scene

Followed Aetnh's instructions to fix audio. Also put 12khz and 16khz way down, 1khz and 3khz up as needed to hear voices."
,You_Muppet,2013-05-05T12:02Z,"A=5, V=6. Thanks, HeroMaster.

To the people who are bitchin' ... stop."
,LittleVinnie,2013-05-05T18:40Z,"best one out as of yet. very watchable. 
Theres just one spot, after he escapes his house and flies while sleeping. After he lands he opens the suit and after icing his arm he tries to go back to sleep inside but jarvis says that he is going to sleep. It sorta skips over that. I know not a very good description but its at 40:20.
But a very good copy! as of 5/5"
,esteban972,2013-05-09T09:49Z,"A/3
