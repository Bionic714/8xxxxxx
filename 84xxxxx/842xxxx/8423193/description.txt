The plan for a quick stop at Mom's takes a sudden turn when an impulse compels Andy (Seth Rogen) to invite his mother, Joyce (Barbara Streisand) on an 8-day, 3,000 mile journey across the country. But the farther they go, the closer they get, so buckle up for the outrageously funny adventure that just might prove they have more in common than Andy ever imagined.
