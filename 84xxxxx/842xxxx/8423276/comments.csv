Having myself been exposed to psychiatry for 16 years, I've can verify that the things described in this film do happen or have happened. I've been inside state psychiatric hospitals. I've experienced iatrogenic (treatment-induced) illness in which the brain is rewired into an abnormal state by psychiatric drugs, and without the drugs applied you experience iatrogenic psychosis. That's right, the cure is the disease. Of course, there are people out there that will claim the film is bunk, but then those same people are the ones that pull the wool over their own eyes and buy into psychiatry's big lie. All I have to say to them is: get yourself committed and check it out, and if you don't have the balls to do it, then fuck off."
