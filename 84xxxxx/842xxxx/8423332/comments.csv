,shogunrza,2013-05-01T01:49Z,"Thanks a bunch!

I am having trouble playing the two middle files with vlc and windows media player. Advice?"
,mikegxr,2013-05-01T14:45Z,"Yeah having same problem with the 2 middles ones also. Ive tried tons of different players and none worked.  Thanks for the uploads, love them.Keep them coming."
,zipomatic,2013-05-01T17:02Z,No idea why you are having problems with the files guys. I tested them all with VLC player before I uploaded them.
,zipomatic,2013-05-01T17:44Z,"BTW, are the files just flat out not playing, or do they stutter in places? Just curious as to what the problem is.

To make up for the trouble, I've uploaded another bunch of ""Strip Game Central"" episodes.
