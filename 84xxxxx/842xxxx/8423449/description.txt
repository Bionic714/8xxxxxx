BBC - It's Kevin - Series 01 - TVrip - Xvid - Slimoo







Sketch show starring and written by Kevin Eldon, British comedy's most prolific supporting star.

It's sketches, it's songs, it's characters, it's guests, it's a man who's old enough to know better mucking about, with help from a number of his comedy friends. It's Kevin Eldon.

 What other show on TV would bring you a song and dance number, The Incredible Moose Human, The Great Spagboletti, A Fictional Northern Man, John Lennon's Head, The Perspective Twins, some performance poetry, Wendy Wilson's White Coat Window On The World Of World Wide Wonders, a sketch with a doctor in it and Hitler, and still not be halfway through the first episode?

 That was a rhetorical question.

 Kevin Eldon's list of credits includes many of the finest and best loved comedies of the last 20 years, including: Big Train, Brass Eye, I'm Alan Partridge, Smack The Pony, Nighty Night, Hot Fuzz, Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle, How TV Ruined Your Life, Four Lions, This Is Jinsy, Arthur Christmas, Hunderby and plenty more.

 Commissioner Cheryl Taylor said: "Kevin Eldon is a very special comedian indeed and we're delighted to have the opportunity to showcase his many talents on BBC Two."
