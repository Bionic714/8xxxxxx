,Lezflanagan,2013-04-29T21:37Z,Anyone confirm if this still has the ingame built DRM that kills the players company after a while?
,lords43,2013-04-29T21:54Z,"@Lezflanagan

if it was real it wouldn't have that link in the description.

Anyway, I downloaded another torrent that seems to have been removed, it was working good, but this game is kind of crapy, it's a plain ripoff of game dev story, won't even play it anymore"
,Heliopios,2013-04-29T23:31Z,"Pathetic. Take this green skull, uploading developer files. Fuck off Ghost. I bet you were paid to put this up, suck my cock you fake faggot wannabe pirates, bending over for a developer."
,razp,2013-04-30T01:07Z,"Wow, the two guys above me are assholes. How about you fuck right off and stop giving the good parts of piracy a bad name?

Or, better yet, upload one torrent before you bitch."
,BigD145,2013-04-30T01:45Z,I love how Greenheart pirated Game Dev Story and made yet another casual tycoon game for the PC. How awesome. NOT

,TempChaos,2013-04-30T19:56Z,"@Heliopos  You're a real asshole you know that?  This is a tiny developer not a giant like those guys EA sponsors.  It's only $8, so take your pitiful allowance your mother gives you and buy the goddamn game instead of bitching.  

Y'all whine about how bad EA is then when a tiny guy like this comes along, you never help them out.   Pirate it if you must, but spend the 8 fucking dollars you sack of hammers."
,JeKvvv,2013-04-30T21:43Z,"Everyone (even these devs) knows piracy isn't going to go away.

They're a tiny team, and they tried something different with the pirated version. It's two days later and now you can pirate the game just fine, so move on with your fucking day.

Heliopios? You're just a real piece of shit. If you don't want to pay, nobody can stop you. So shut your entitled-ass mouth and do what you're gonna do. The rest of us will be quite happy without your adolescent shit."
,eimixas,2013-04-30T21:50Z,@TempChaos oh yeah? Then what should I don when the game is ove 20 bucks in my country?
,Dr_manezz,2013-04-30T22:01Z,"not downloaded yet, but seeing some moral crap.not downloaded yet, but seeing some moral crap.

from what i've seen of this game, it could easily be made browser playable. if the devs really wanted money they'd make it a flash browser playable game with ads on the webpage. 

just another tycoon game, just another rip off tycoon game, just another indie rip off tycoon game. but i guess you have to start somewhere."
,TacticalSheep,2013-04-30T22:21Z,This game is not worth even pirating not to say buying... you can get a better one for free and play it in the browser ffs .... this seems like a silly cash in
,Lenhoy,2013-04-30T23:42Z,"anyone saying it's a ripoff of game dev story, this is an MAJOR IMPROVMENT. "
,averagehuman,2013-04-30T23:43Z,"To all of you who feel sorry for these sad motherfuckers in Greenheart Games - consider the fact that they stole the entire game concept, including graphics and sound, from Kairosoft's Game Dev Story from 2009. The assholes who made this didn't even change the name, just tagged on Tycoon instead of Story."
,Deicide660,2013-05-01T00:30Z,"Ugh...this game. My issue with it is that you never have time to relax and bask in the glory of your company...this should be alternatively titled, ""You Own a Failing Game Company...Pay the Bills"""

,user46565,2013-05-01T07:36Z,"working well, no antipiracy in that one full game. but Game Dev Story is way better!"
,phaxor90,2013-05-01T11:14Z,"1. Found out about this game through an article about its piracy DRM.
2. Proceeded to head to the site to BUY the game to support through the developer.
3. Scroll through the images, functions and features of the game thinking... WTF? These guys plagiarized kairosoft and have the audacity to complain about piracy?
4. Heads to thepiratebay for torrent instead.

FYI if you're the creator and reading this: 90% of people wouldn't have bought your game in the first place. Your company is unknown, has little to no reputation, you're charging $8 for an indie game where you can pickup an iphone one for $1, you zynga-plagiarized Game Dev Story to the point that even the title is the same in what seems like an attempt to gather sales from misleading customers in thinking this is a Kairosoft game."
,DailyNerd,2013-05-01T20:52Z,I find it hilarious people are up in arms about this game being so similar to Kairo's game (Game Dev Story) yet people eat up iteration after iteration of modern day military FPS's like sugar coated bacon.
,Bluexar,2013-05-02T00:00Z,"This game is legit (aka no shitty piracy drm).

It is pretty fun, although it seems to be a big, a bit more complexe, rip-off of the android game.

So, the next time you complain about pirates, make a original game at least, and be happy with the PR you got with the news about it.

,thaghost1,2013-05-02T05:29Z,"Are you guys sure this ""game destroying DRM"" isn't present in this one? Or do I just suck balls at this game? Because when I get to the Super Nintendo generation, I can't seem to get a game to score over 4, Yet anything before that I can get multiple 10s in a row."
,dib_tpb,2013-05-02T06:39Z,"thaghost1: If it were, you would know it.  The crippled version had some sort of message box.

,sannukas0016,2013-05-02T06:52Z,This has that anti-piracy thing. Few minutes into the game you get messages saying ''Thank you so much for buying this game''.
,sannukas0016,2013-05-02T06:55Z,Atleast i think that this ''thank you message'' was ment to be ironic so you would feel bad for pirating it.

,Alenthas,2013-05-02T19:59Z,"That piracy thing is just a marketing stunt. No one heard about this game before that, although I agree it is somewhat funny, 90%+ piracy doesn't mean shit.

,mlech,2013-05-02T23:26Z,I can confirm this torrent works well.  The game is small but fun. I enjoyed the not-so-subtle anti piracy messages.  Buy the game!

I felt bad for pirating and decided to find it and buy it...It's a cheap simple awesome game..And they deserve my support.

The link you provided http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8429588/Game_Dev_Tycoon is the dev piracy warning version.

Compare this with the malicious one uploaded by the dev themselves:

,TymonTheThief,2013-05-04T10:56Z,"I honestly wouldn't give two shits about a crappy junk game like this. But when you troll the community and use statistics that YOU CAUSE as grounds to bitch and moan, you make more enemies than you convince. I'm usually in the market of piracy to try shit out WITHOUT bullshit restrictions at my own pace, to make an actual educated decision on if it's worth paying for or not. If it is not worth paying for, then I trash it. If it IS worth paying for then I actually do buy it! There are exceptions to the rule of course. I generally say fuck any big business developers, like adobe, Microsoft, EA, and so on, because they fuck their customers over enough that I don't feel a twinge of guilt at all repaying the favor in kind. Now, the same thing could be said about this shitty game which is a ripoff in of itself. I actually plan on pirating it when the real version of the game comes out, just out or principle. Anyone who intentionally fucks with people, deserves what is coming to them. Funny thing is, if you didn't pull this bullshit stunt, I might actually have been a paying customer instead."
,SingerNS,2013-05-05T14:34Z,one small thing all of you a**holes forgot to mention is that this is yet another password protected survey bullshit that leads you to paying more than buying original game...
,Johann-Weiss,2013-05-07T22:34Z,"@Mavese, or should I call you herr Klug(hosen)?..
There are many quality and shareware stuff that are really very helpful for many people every day, worth donations much more than this shit.
Consider to donate them.
But DO NOT PAY people who take mostly results of others work, combine them in a shitty-interface bugged school essay and start to manipulate people.
I seriously recall the saying:
*Conscientiousness is invented by bad people, in order to manipulate good people.* %)
Guys, don't support shit-developers!
Herren Klug, try to make your plagiat more original - invent your own design. Also, heal your buttons from laziness, make your music shut up when it is told to, make normal info & nav systems, check for bugs thoroughly and publish only quality works.
Then you'll make 1st step to being real programmers like us.
But do not develop the practice of feeding the people shit and getting money for that. Or you'll regret that one day.
Be real men, not schuler moneybeggars."
,sharpshot94549,2013-05-08T09:30Z,"this version does NOT have the developer trolling, game breaking, piracy mod. It is the full game."
,weltall2,2013-05-08T10:10Z,"I cna't really say if there is a piracy drm or whatnot, but I can say that while playing I was properly thanked by the creators (a messaged popped saying thank you for buying the game) and I have been getting more and more money to the point I donno what to do with it. I am on almost the end of year 3 and I have 460K. At no point up to now. I did not get any contract and probably wont since I am making so much easily and well everything looks fairly easy. 

Also I do not see why some people comment about it as if it is bad that it is copying Game Dev Story. A lot of great games nowadays are just copies and rip-offs of older games. It is not like they did not add their own touch. Even if it seems you are playing the same game, the same time it feels like you are playing a different game too. The only thing I do not like is the lack of the cartoony characters. I am definitely though buying this one. "
,noTURF,2013-05-09T02:47Z,"the storyline goes up to year 30 after that you get no new stuff, and at year 56 it got boring for me once i did everything and got my company trillions and had the highest market share"
,nerdrage12,2013-05-11T21:09Z,"Thanks for the upload Gh0st!

Full game (play up to 35 years), no bugs.

The game starts out pretty fun but gets old pretty quickly. There needs to be more activities in between developing games. You really need to rely on making game after game after game after game to build up some money. But once you hit around 20 - 30 million it's really kind of pointless to play as you have enough money that your monthly bills don't really affect you. I played to $50 million and never even left the garage.
