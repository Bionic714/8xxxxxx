What's cool about it:
Bombs, gibs, babes and a whole lot of shooting
Duke is back with even more ass-kicking awesome one-liners!
An intense, fast-paced, action-packed arcade experience
Overview:
Gaming's king of action returns in an all new adventure, this time in New York City. Duke battles his way across towering skyscraper rooftops and through gritty subway stations, hunting for a power-hungry villain, Mech Morphix. Mutants of every kind are thrown at Duke as he chases down Morphix through eight huge environments and avoids the green slime called GLOPP which is causing all the chaos.

But radioactive slime isn't Duke's only problem - there are more than 25 uniquely dangerous mutated enemies hell-bent on making a meal of him. Whether it's Uzi-sporting alligators or ten-foot tall roach beasts - Duke's in town to blast the bad guys and save the chicks. Sure, pipe bombs, a machine gun, a rocket launcher and a pulse cannon are going to make a goo-filled mess in the Big Apple, but what's a hero to do?
