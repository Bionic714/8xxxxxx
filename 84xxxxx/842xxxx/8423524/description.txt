What's cool about it:
Bloody, brutal, swearing-heavy combat - one of the first truly adult-oriented games
Impressive graphics and AI for its time
An Original Soundtrack by Cypress Hill
Overview:
As a thug beaten to the brink of death you have started your mission of revenge. You want to bury those bastards six feet under for what they have done to you, but to do so you need to start your own gang and recruit right from the streets. If a new gang member turns out to be a punk, blast him, and make room for new ones. Move up in the world, but watch out for the Kingpin, eventually you're going to have to take him on.

Somewhere in the past that never crossed paths with the future lies the world of the Kingpin. Burned out buildings and urban decay are the landscape. Local gangs roam the streets, protecting their turf and scooping out opportunities.

Recruit a gang of thugs and rule the streets, snuff out rivals with a single head-shot and watch them bleed to death. Or put them on fire and watch them suffer. You will deliver an extremely brutal and violent death to those who messed you up. Kill everyone who stands in your way and become new Kingpin - crime lord of every thief, murderer and dirty thug in the city.
