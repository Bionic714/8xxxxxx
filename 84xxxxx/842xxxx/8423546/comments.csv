Althrough I have to say there are some very weak covers. #102, for example, is one of the worst. 

That's a shame mainly because this was such an incredible issue originally drawn by the great Barry Windsor Smith (The Uncanny X-Men #205).

It's no surprise this series got cancelled after all. Chris Claremont's backup stories and John Bolton's art were definitely the cherries of this cake, but in the end, without them, the series became redundant and unnecessary."

anyway, you're welcome!"
