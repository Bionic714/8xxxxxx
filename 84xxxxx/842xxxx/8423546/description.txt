This is part 2 of a 2-part torrent set, requested by ggaanneesshhaa. The 1st half is here:

The title was changed, the backup stories were gone, but this reprint title ran for another 5 1/2 years (and even spawned a spin-off, X-Men: The Early Years)!

All-new front covers for these are by such greats as Steve Lightle (046-056), Mike Mignola (057-070), Adam Hughes (071-079, who drew the picture above), Joe Madureira (081-083), and Tom Grummett (099-101).

Note: In 1990, when the "Days of Future Past" story should've been reprinted (after #46), the title skipped ahead to Uncanny X-Men #143. Why? Because in 1989, the story had been reprinted in the first version of "The Uncanny X-Men: Days of Future Past" prestige format comic. That little book became one of the best-selling collected editions in Marvel history, eventually reaching a 5th printing before Marvel released an expanded version as a full trade paperback.

In this torrent, I've included scans of those 2 missing issues.
