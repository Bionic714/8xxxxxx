,architeuthis666,2013-05-12T05:52Z,"Quick comments. VERY high-quality encode, kudos to Deadfish. I am really not a fan of the font used for the subtitles though. Normally a plain sans-serif font is used with a black stroke for maximum readability. Using a serif font with a maroon stroke seems like the subber trying to put their mark on the encode. IMHO, subbers should strive to have their work not be noticed -- subs should be so flawless and unobtrusive you sometimes forget you are reading the dialogue instead of hearing it."
