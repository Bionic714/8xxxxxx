24/44 is a stupid sr and in wav is simply wastefull. Boost is also not helping. 

Next time look for a 24/88 flac. And NO boost. These albums are pre-loudnesswar and that is the way they are supposed to sound; with proper dynamics.

If you don't like 16/44 or 24/44 you can enjoy the beautiful quality of your sacd's..... "
