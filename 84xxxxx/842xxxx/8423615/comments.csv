,pagansun,2013-04-29T22:54Z,How very odd indeed ... only 3 episodes of this show were made before it was shut down ? but here we have a 5th episode ... ?
,pagansun,2013-04-29T22:56Z,Is this show cancelled or not ?  I was under the impression that it was axed ?
,gayavenger,2013-04-29T23:01Z,“Zero Hour” only aired three episodes before getting dropped. Ten more episodes are in the can. (TV rage)
,ben1366,2013-04-30T12:13Z,"Two midseason dramas pulled quickly after their premieres have gotten their unaired episodes scheduled. ABC‘s Zero Hour and NBC‘s Do No Harm both have landed burnoff Saturday slots. Zero Hour, which only aired three episodes before getting the axe and has 10 more episodes in the can, will return on June 15 at 8 with two back-to-back episodes. It will then air in the 8 PM hour until a two-hour finale on Aug. 3."
