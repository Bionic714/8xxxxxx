I spent a lot of time working on this show.I'd love to read your 

comments if it was worth so much effort.Otherwise, everything was 

done in Sony Sound Forge 10 pro except conversion in Flac and mp3 

format.This was done in dbpoweramp release 14.4.
Once again, please leave your comments and suggestions to improve 

in the future where I went wrong.
Thanks in advance.
