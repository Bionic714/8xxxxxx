This is the spectacular White Stripes concert Under Blackpool Lights filmed at The Empress Ballroom, Blackpool, England, January 27 and 28, 2004. The show was shot with super 8 and 16mm film cameras for a grainy look that matches the music's punk blues, 70s hard rock vibe. These films were edited to a PAL DVD with 3 soundtracks: 2.0 LPCM, 5.1 AC3 and 5.1 DTS. This mkv ONLY has the DTS soundtrack.

Video: the source is quite grainy to start with so a fairly high Handbrake RF setting of 22.5 was used and the final output compares almost identically to the PAL DVD source.

Audio: to produce the absolute best audio quality, DTS passthrough was used so the soundtrack is the exact DTS track from the PAL DVD with no re-encoding. If there's trouble with the mkv's sound, get a player with DTS support built in like PotPlayer or VLC.
