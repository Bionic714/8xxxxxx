As I recall, this was one of the few special titles that First Comics did in this format.  The Twilight Man, Sensei were the others.

Wouldn't mind seeing Meta 4, Zero Tolerance, Shatter, Sable: Return of the Hunter, and the Classics Illustrated among your list.

But I digress, thanks for the ul, Ichthypod_Crane! "
