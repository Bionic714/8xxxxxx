,Sorg84,2013-04-30T12:59Z,"Video quality is nowhere near neither 720p nor 1884Kbps, it looks more like a 360p AVI, like a YouTube video, moreover it's heavily watermarked, and it has a symbol in the middle to right portion of the video.

Actually it really looks like a low quality screen capture rather than a proper rip. And I'm pretty sure about it because you get windows from the desktop activities of the ripper popping out on the video.

Audio is Japanese, with English subs, but is at leat 40mms out of sync. And it is nowhere near 192Kbps, it sounds metallic like a bad mp3.

Not worth downloading in my opinion. But it's free, so thanks anyways."

A-4
V-2"
,tannz0rz,2013-05-02T21:12Z,"Simply terrible.

It's a web-rip, in which the video itself is no better than 240-360p quality. The framerate is completely screwed and the audio is offset incorrectly from the video.

V-3
A-4

Just wait for someone to release a proper BRrip before you waste your time on this."
