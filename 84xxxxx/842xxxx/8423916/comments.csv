,anterior2dasuperior,2013-05-16T16:00Z,"These are Kaplan Center Prep Videos, obviously the prerecorded videos they sell for a couple of year.  They only make the center prep vids every 4-6 years.  The last two installments were 2010 and 2004.  Other subscriptions like High Yield, which is new, they make every year.  And Classroom Anywhere is live online instruction that happens every few months.  I have the newest Center prep vids, the newest High Yield course and the newest Classroom Anywhere, so I know which is which and how many are in each one.  Center Prep are the basic videos that are at the centers if you want to physically go and watch them on DVD, you can also get them online.  These videos are Center prep. Some of these are 2010 and some are 2004, however they are not complete.  Mine is complete and I saw that this file is larger than my completed one so I downloaded to make sure I wasn't missing anything and the uploader has two sets of Psych videos, one set from 2004 and one set from 2012, also has Emergency Medicine from 2004 with only 5 videos when there are 20 EM videos with the 2010 course, Epi and Ethics is a mix of 2004 and 2010. Preventive Medicine is short 2 videos.  Rhematology is short 6 videos.  Gyne here has one extra video, I think from 2004.  Neuro is 3 videos short.  Psych has 2 folders, one from 2004 and the other from 2010.  Surgery is missing 3 videos.  Aside from these corrections, the remaining videos are 2010, but this is definitley not complete.  "

do you know if there are any goljan recordings for the step 2 available?"
,anterior2dasuperior,2013-05-25T10:45Z,"Hey there lalal55:  Yes there is some rare audio from Goljan for Step 2 that I have and you can find it if you look hard enough, not on TPB though.  Leave your email and I will be in touch.  Also, before this torrent I DL'd the 2010 Step 2 vids piece by piece from TPB and a few other sites and accumulated about 75% of it and then got the rest from a friend.  This torrent here is not even complete, I wouldn't even bother as it has quite a few vids from 2004 mixed in. "
