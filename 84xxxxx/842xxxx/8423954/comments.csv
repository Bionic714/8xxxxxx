,nimatrueway,2013-05-02T20:29Z,"Thank you, microload !"
,btsobo,2013-05-07T00:43Z,"any ideas how to get free access to their new project ""SIMPLE 30""?"
,kingjiggy,2013-05-07T17:21Z,"What is ""Simple 30""?"
,210285,2013-05-07T23:46Z,Type 30.simplepickup.com in your browser. Microload please upload the begginer version of it. Its only available till may 13.
,210285,2013-05-07T23:56Z,Where's week 3
,Diego_TPB,2013-05-08T02:19Z,Are you planning to get simple 30? Limited access till May 13. Maybe you can ask for donations bro. If 50 people donate 2 dollars is enough.
,Diego_TPB,2013-05-08T02:27Z,"^^ Correction: It costs 200 dls, so 50 people (approximately the people seeding this kind of torrents)  must donate 4 dls, come on its like a bigmac, but better!"

,yakem07,2013-05-10T04:08Z,"hey microload, we are wating for this week video, Q and A, and podcast.... forget about these kids here asking if you re going to upload simple 30"
,nyzilleztndn,2013-05-11T00:35Z,"boys, what we have here is simple 30. my indian mind is telling me what you guys are thinking is good, 50 people 4 bucks. i personally think that is going to be hard. WHO HAS SIMPLE30? nd if possible they should at least write in text what the challege is every day, or somehow try to downloda it then upload, spread the word."
,Charlie_Firpo,2013-05-13T18:08Z,"Anyone here with computer skills? I have the 'No Redirect' for the simplepickup site.
If I go to http://www.simplepickup.com/simple30/day-1
I can see the comments for their day-1 challenge, but no video.. How about you? Can you see the video? How could we make it visible? I'm counting on you guys!"
,210285,2013-05-16T02:07Z,what happened to simple 30
,poptart1,2013-05-16T02:42Z,"Hey microload can u post the link of the actual video on simple 30 here
by the link i mean the url"
,btsobo,2013-05-20T10:35Z,"Guys this microload guy is in collabo with SP. That upload of Simple 30 day 1 and the whole action of ""microload"" being busted by Simple Pickup was created just to scary us, thepiratebay users.
Isn't it strange, where we were able to download a folder containing 2 different versions of video? I mean, one of the clips was almost the same as the other one, but with just an exception. In the ""real video""  which is I think available to simple 30 subscribers, there was nothing mentioned about bonus clip video (Kongs 90 min pickup). The other one was longer and contained some sort of scam. I was able to read through the comments under Simple 30 days (but couldnt watch videos) and i figured out there was never a bonus clip."
,btsobo,2013-05-20T10:37Z,"What is more, the accusation post which was meant to be sent to microload by SP team, was a fake. It contained false link to the site with law help which never existed"
,btsobo,2013-05-20T10:41Z,"In other words, it was a well prepared provocation."
,ali112,2013-05-24T22:33Z,"@btsobo You sound right. Thanks for your considerations! I got confused with the Simple 30 day 1 being off again, but now it makes sense."
,slipshod1,2013-06-10T19:43Z,"guys what if microland is actually naive?
maybe SP contacted him to scare HIM off... 
just saying because its odd he is uploading more videos"
