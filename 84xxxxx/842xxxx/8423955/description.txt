Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, April 29 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex continues to piece apart the narrative concocted around the Boston Marathon bombings, highlighting the dangers of mass Stockholm syndrome which led some Americans to disturbingly, albeit cheerfully, give up their constitutional liberties for the illusion of security. 

Hosting alongside Alex are Infowars reporters David Knight and Jakari Jackson, with special guest host American trend forecaster and publisher of the Trends Journal Gerald Celente. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes senior editor of The New American William F. Jasper to examine the so-called elite's progress in constructing their long sought New World Order, and the fact that they must continually brag about it openly to condition the public to accept it.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
