,LifeTheHound,2013-04-30T05:35Z,"Thinking of releasing a mid-season batch.
It will include this episode along with new encodes of episodes 1-4, including a ""new"" censored version of episode 3. 

This will also fix compatibility problems caused by a minor flaw in the encoding that resulted in occasional green blocks on certain hardware. 

Is there any interest?"
,Flame_Leg,2013-04-30T06:28Z,"I don't think it's really necessary, til the season is complete. One thing to note is It would be nice if you specified all the scenes you edited in the description. Also, maybe this is just personal preference, but I would of preferred if you cut the rear end nudity as well.

I was thinking that if I had time, I would go back and redo all of the series, and fully censor them. Like, remove all the cussing this time. and use proper black bars, or maybe blurring, instead of the freeze frames. So perhaps, you can just keep yours this way, and there can be two versions, one fully censored, and the other partially censored. Just an idea, since I'm not sure if I'll want to commit the time to do all of that.

Anyway, keep up the good work!"
,LifeTheHound,2013-04-30T07:13Z,"Got it. I'll wait until the end for the batch.

Rear-end censoring, didn't think about that. I certainly think that's manageable from here on out. :)

Specific scenes edited this episode: 
- Jon and Ygrite cave sex (cut all from stripping to the hot spring)
- Jamie's tub entrance (black bar to hide front junk -- his butt still shows!)
- Loras and random guy (maybe Petyr Baelish's plant) sex -- was there anything important to the story in here? I kind of skipped it entirely...

Thanks for the continued suggestions and support!"
,Elizabeth_I,2013-04-30T11:13Z,"Can you cut out the violence too? Oh never-mind, might as well not even watch it... this editing is far more offensive then even hardcore porn."
,LifeTheHound,2013-05-01T05:56Z,"@Elizabeth:
The style of editing or the fact that it was censored in the first place? I would certainly appreciate advice about the former, at least. ;-)

I have not investigated blurring, for one. I have used blurring before (to some degree) but never specifically for censoring. As for editing extreme violence, this is possible as well with a bit of effort, but the fact remains that violence and swearing is often far less awkward among friends and family than sexual content, strange as though that may seem."
,dreadquake,2013-05-01T18:24Z,"I am highly dissatisfied with these censored versions! My delicate sensibilities were violated when I thought I saw the shadow of a nipple! I had to flagellate myself for 3 straight hours to purge myself of lustful thoughts! I will not truly be able to watch this show without being stained by sin, until you guys commit to re-shooting the entire series with nerf swords, and people simply exchanging a firm handshake instead of fucking!"
,greeny013,2013-05-07T01:29Z,"i just signd up just to to say thank u, me and my wife didint watch this amazing show because of all the nudity  and now we can i realy appiceate all the work you put in and carnt wait for more  thanks again"
,LifeTheHound,2013-05-07T10:11Z,"Episode 6 doesn't seem to have sexually objectionable scenes. There is a reference by Ingrit to Jon Snow about ""what he did with his tongue"", but for the censored record, it was just a particularly steamy french kiss. ;-)"
,greeny013,2013-05-07T23:10Z,thanks for the info : )
,DaevydTargaryen,2013-05-08T22:34Z,"What program(s) do you use to censor these episodes?  There are other shows I like that have scenes that I wish were not there.  So, I would like to censor them myself."
,DaevydTargaryen,2013-05-08T22:38Z,What program did you use to censor this?
,skeleton_thunder,2013-05-11T03:35Z,"Thank you so much for spending the time to do this. Keep up the good work, seriously. I have noticed that your 720p mp4 are significantly smaller in file size compared to the typical x264 720p torrents. 300mb vs 1gb. I think your compression looks great for only being 300mb, however, I do prefer the sharpness that you get with file sizes around 1gb. Do you have any plans to make your censored edits a little higher quality? Thanks again!"
,sorayahya,2013-05-13T21:39Z,"Thank you very much for Censoring Game of Thrones, I can finally watch this amazing series :D

Are you planning on Censoring Episode 7 anytime soon?"
,LifeTheHound,2013-05-14T10:34Z,"DaevydTargaryen, I use AVXSynth (Linux) with whatever frameserver/GUI I happen to have available at the time. 

skeleton_thunder, thanks for the support and suggestion. Since I keep all my scripts, I can re-release in any quality you like. I don't find these significantly less sharp than bigger files; rather, I find the bigger files needlessly bloated (Scene rules or something like that -- filesizes are locked in even when they're not always necessary). Don't let the small size discourage you, though! Keep in mind we are all subject to placebo (large filesize therefore better) and confirmation bias (small filesize therefore I think I see more flaws). Sometimes it's not the quantity of bits stored per unit space, but the quality, illogical as that sounds. 

sorayahya, yes, I released it, but it sometimes takes awhile for the site to update. If you like, you can grab the magnet link: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:87176A3C007D656A471EA97B3207F0A3B75E89B0&dn=GoT3-07.mp4&tr=udp%3a//tracker.openbittorrent.com%3a80/announce"
