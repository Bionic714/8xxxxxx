,PirateBlast2013,2013-05-01T04:37Z,"Bro, you're retarded! It's 3.5! Who agrees?"
,viejogab,2013-05-01T06:13Z,"the file says 3.5 but when i opened the installer it says that its 3.4, explain that "
,PirateBlast2013,2013-05-01T08:22Z,"I didn't noticed that, but I'm sure it's 3.5 + 3.5.1 because I downloaded it straight from http://pesedit.com/forums/showthread.php?16713-PESEdit-com-2013-Patch-3-5-Released%21
Even the small 3.5.1 patch says it's 3.4 so I guess Pesedit.com forgot to change the version number in the setup screen for some reason."
,PirateBlast2013,2013-05-01T08:23Z,And the PDF files say it's 3.5
,cekerap3000,2013-05-01T09:12Z,Thanx for this patch and I can confirm what Pirateblast says it's 3.5 version
