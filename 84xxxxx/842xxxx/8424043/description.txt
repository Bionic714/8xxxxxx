Aside from the bionic movies that came a few years later starting 
with The Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman, 
this Season Premiere was the actual first TV reunion of Lee Majors
and Lindsay Wagner in different roles. Yes, ABC knew how to get ratings!

That happened again on The Fall Guy later this same season
when Richard Anderson appeared to make trouble for Colt Seavers!

Also guest starring in this episode is Mark Goddard.
