Punk-infused alt-country rockers Lucero have always sought to capture the spirit of their Memphis home on record. However, the sextet looks to take one step closer in becoming ΓÇ£the 21st century voice of that great musical city,ΓÇ¥ according to a press release, with the March 13th release of their ATO Records debut, Women & Work.

The album collects 11 original cuts that ΓÇ£range from barroom brawlers to lonesome laments, and cut deeper than anything else in the bandΓÇÖs extensive catalog.ΓÇ¥ [sic] Women & Work sees the band joined once more by a duo of legendary horn players, Scott Thompson (Cat Power, Al Green) and Jim Spake (Solomon Burke, Ray Charles). Also re-teaming with Lucero for the new effort is producer Ted Hutt, who has logged time for The Gaslight Anthem and Flogging Molly, among others.
