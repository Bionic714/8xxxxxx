"Avatar Abridged was first started by GanXingba. He was assisted by PsychoSilver, and later KaiserNeko; both who took up the role of editor. The plot of the story is basically the same; however filler episodes have been reduced in size and significance. Often, two fillers are put together into one abridged episode."
