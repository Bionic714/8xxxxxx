,CollectiveX,2013-04-30T23:00Z,"Not at the moment, but I can pull individual tracks. I'm thinking the ""Anything Goes/Anything You Can Do"" and ""Pretty/Unpretty"" mashups deserve to get flac'd. Glee is at its best when its pretty. (I don't anyone needs ""Fat Bottom Girls"" in full fidelity.) "
,kaithekilla,2013-05-01T00:38Z,"Youre absolutely right! yes i have glee the music vol 6 in flac, but thats the only one, i was thinking most of ""i believe i can fly/fly"" mix, it just wasnt so smooth in mp3. Totally agree on Pretty/Unpretty!"
