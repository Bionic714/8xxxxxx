Hello everyone!

First off let me say this is my first venture into video encoding and also uploading my own torrent.

Secondly, I was very disheartened to see that my favorite cartoon of all time, Futurama was once again canceled!

I decided I wanted to do some High Quality DVD-Rips of the first 4 seasons of Futurama (which were NON-HD) for myself and to share with everyone else who loves this show and is sad to see it go!!!

These videos are NOT deinterlaced!.....I was not satisfied with the quality of any of the encodes I did using the deinterlace option.

Again, this was my first time with all this stuff but I have an open ear to any tips or suggestions from anyone toward future encoding, or torrent uploading.

I will be seeding for at least a month straight!

Thanks for checking this out!
