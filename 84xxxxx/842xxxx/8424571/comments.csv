[T],TxJag,2013-05-06T05:22Z,"For those who are interested: I'm compiling all available Patterson books at the moment. Any books that aren't retail or have been updated (layout, additional sneak peeks at future books) by the publisher are getting put together. If I had to hazard a guess when this would all be finished I'd say about 2 weeks. Even his YA and light reading novels will be in this release. It's going to be over 100 books in upwards of 50 to 60 MBs. I'm only missing a few books."
