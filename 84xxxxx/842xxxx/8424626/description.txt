RoboForm Pro Desktop and RoboForm2Go v7.8.8.5 ┬⌐2013 with patch by novice2 / RU-Board [brought to you by onttm]

Just install your choice of RoboForm (Desktop vs Portable) and run the patch (read the patch txt file for command-line arguments to patch Portable). No need to close RoboForm before patching; the patch will kill the processes for you.  All you need to do is run the RoboForm TaskBar Icon after patching.

See included screen shots of both RF editions with and without Sync enabled.

Currently working on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64

Enjoy!

NOTE: To date, there is still no universal patch for roboform-x64.dll, so you will have to continue using a 32-bit browser or pay for a legitimate Roboform license to enable 64-bit browser support. (or find another patched roboform-x64.dll for this version of RF)

NOTE 2: I have seen the rare comment that the patch doesn't work after version "blah blah blah" (it's always different).  If at first you don't succeed, try running the patch a 2nd time.
