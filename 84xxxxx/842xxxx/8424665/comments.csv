There were about 11 leechers downloading from me after you went offline, so I'll stick around at least for the rest of the week, so those looking for he zero-days can spot and nab these, just so the kids/brats can be exposed to the Golden Age and have a chance to learn to appreciate the days when comics cost exactly what they were worth :)

Oh, and as far as ""Super-Cars"" went in the 40s insofar as speed went, it gave an original definition to Sammy Hagar's ""I Can't Drive 55!"" :P :P

""Chee! Hey Weasel! Bicycle Repair Man's gainin' on us! I toldja we shoulda stolen dat fast-lookin' Cord limo instead o'dis plain-lookin' Model T!""

""Bah, he's only on a two-speed. We'll lose him at the next turn. We'll be going uphill for the next six blocks!""

Narrarator: ""Little did the two bank robbers know that at the end of those six blocks was an 11-block downhill!""

Bicycle Repair Man: ""A-Ha! Those villains don't know about my special abilities to make bicycles go faster going downhill! I'll break out my trusty can of WD-10, grease up my pedals and bearings, and catch up to them before five blocks have gone by! Tally-Ho, Bendix!!""

Satire? Humor? The Golden Age was exactly like that, kids. That's why we loved it :P"
