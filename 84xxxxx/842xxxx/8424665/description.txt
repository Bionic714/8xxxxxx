Captain (later Major) Hornet, Aide to the President, became a costumed, super-strong, killer vigilante known as Flagman. He fought the enemies who could not be dealt with by military regulations or the law. He was active both on the home-front as well as in the South Pacific against the Japanese. Flagman was an agile and skilled fighter and capable of feats of strength, being able to bend prison bars with little effort. He was assisted by his sidekick, Rusty. Flagman drove a green "super-car', which was capable of high speeds.
