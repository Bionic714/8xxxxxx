What Makes this Super rare?

According to the Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide (2000), Green Giant Comics #1 was an experiment to determine if the company could profitably manufacture and distribute comics with their otherwise idle printing presses. The Moreau Publishing company believes the book was never released to news stands.
In 2007, a CGC VeryFine 8.0 sold at auction for $8740

Alex Ross redesigned this guy and he will be in some upcoming Project Superpowers stuff, or he already was, I can't remember.

Origin:

Virtually nothing is known about the superhero known as The Green Giant. He does appear to be completely bullet-proof, super strong, and able to stand 15 stories in the air at his tallest. His real surname is Brentwood, but further details were never revealed.

His powers come from his belt, which include growing to tremendous size and flight
