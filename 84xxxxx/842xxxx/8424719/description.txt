Many people don't like this film, and I would say that the majority of those wanted to see an Adam Sandler movie.
This is certainly not one of those, but it is gorgeous. It's a love story, but that fails to describe such a bizarre turn of events. Anderson's only comedy (as of the date this is written, obviously) is tender and mystical, 
a mosaic of spakling color and romance that is more relatable than any packaged date movie. 
This will never be remembered like Boogie Nights or There Will Be Blood, but it cannot be denied its place as an astonishing work in its own right.
