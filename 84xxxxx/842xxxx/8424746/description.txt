The Toh Kay album "The Hand That Thieves" is a companion piece to Streetlight Manifesto's "The Hands That Thieve", with each song performed by Toh Kay and his acoustic trio.  The album has a slower, laid back and late night feel.

The highest quality I can get this at the moment is unfortunately 128kbps. It still sounds great, but keep an eye out for a higher-quality release in the next few days.
