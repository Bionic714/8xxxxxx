From the grand master of the 

historical novel comes a dazzling, epic portrait of the City of 

Light 


Internationally bestselling author Edward Rutherfurd has 

enchanted millions of readers with his sweeping, 

multigenerational dramas that illuminate the great achievements 

and travails throughout history. In this breathtaking saga of 

love, war, art, and intrigue, Rutherfurd has set his sights on 

the most magnificent city in the world: Paris. 



Moving back and forth in time across centuries, the story unfolds 

through intimate and vivid tales of self-discovery, divided 

loyalties , passion, and long-kept secrets of characters both 

fictional and real, all set against the backdrop of the glorious 

city—from the building of Notre Dame to the dangerous 

machinations of Cardinal Richlieu; from the glittering court of 

Versailles to the violence of the French Revolution and the Paris 

Commune; from the hedonism of the Belle Époque, the heyday of the 

impressionists, to the tragedy of the First World War; from the 

1920s when the writers of the Lost Generation could be found 

drinking at Les Deux Magots to the Nazi occupation, the heroic 

efforts of the French Resistance, and the 1968 student revolt. 


With his unrivaled blend of impeccable research and narrative 

verve, Rutherfurd weaves an extraordinary narrative tapestry that 

captures all the glory of Paris. More richly detailed, more 

thrilling, and more romantic then anything Rutherfurd has written 

before, Paris: The Novel wonderfully illuminates hundreds of 

years in the City of Light and Love and brings the sights, 

scents, and tastes of Paris to sumptuous life.
