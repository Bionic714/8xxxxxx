What's cool about it:

    Includes the original Disciples II: Dark Prophecy and all 3 expansion packs: Guardians of The Light, Servants of The Dark and Rise of The Elves.
    An incredible atmosphere obtained with haunting and eerie music as well as grim-looking visuals
    A mix of turn-based strategy and RPG in which your characters and units gain experience

Overview:

A decade after the First Great War, the final prophecy continues to unfold. Deep within the crevices of the Sacred Lands, the Chosen One has emerged, fated to bring salvation to some and destruction to others. Braced with renewed faith and newfound conviction, each race must once again take up the sword for the sake of their people and the glory of their God.

Set in the magical realm of the Sacred Lands, four races - the Empire, the Mountain Clans, the Legions of the Damned, and the Undead Hordes - battle for the destiny of their gods. All of the campaigns and hundreds of hours of gameplay in one adventure package.
