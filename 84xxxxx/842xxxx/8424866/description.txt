I'm OCD about ebook formatting and I noticed a lot (read: all) of the copies of these books on TPB are messed in terms of formatting. Throughout all three books, there were paragraph breaks in the middle of quotations. There were also some OCR errors mostly in book 3. 

This upload aims to correct all that. Please let me know if you find any errors.


Files included are:
The Hedge Knight - George R. R. Martin.epub
The Sworn Sword - George R. R. Martin.epub
The Mystery Knight - Goerge R. R. Martin.epub

And sorry, I didn't mark out which comes first. So, it goes Hedge Knight, Sworn Sword, Mystery Knight. Shouldn't have any problems. Enjoy!
