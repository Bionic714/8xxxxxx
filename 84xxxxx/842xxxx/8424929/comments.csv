But the key actually works, and I tried putting something else in but it tells me it's invalid.

So the key is basically valid, then the program automatically closes itself, and I go to open it again but it acts as if it is not registered and still says 15 day trial...

I even tried running it and registering it in Administrator and it still doesn't work...

Going to use a different torrent, now."
