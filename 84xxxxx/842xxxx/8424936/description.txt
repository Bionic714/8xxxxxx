Content of torrent 3742013 (if you get it here, you skip past the step of extracting an ISO file from a set of RARs). NTSC, 720x480-24.

Added: index files, for opening VOBs with Avidemux. Some screenshots. Extracted SRT subtitles, EN-ES-FR (not needed just to play the DVD). If you want to include this added stuff, you may need to fiddle with configuration before you burn to disc.

Note on width-to height ratio:
The opening scenes are letterboxed, to preserve titles. The remainder is 4:3. If you think maybe it was really originally shot that way (with Panaflex cameras!), I have a real estate deal you might be interested in.

So if you are lucky enough to record a broadcast of the whole thing in widescreen, even on VHS, be a hero and be the first to share it.
