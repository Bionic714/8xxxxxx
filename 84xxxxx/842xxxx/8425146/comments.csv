But yea, otherwise it works.

Note to people, who also hate amateur custom installers:
Get official free version installer. After installing it, use branding.dll and CCleaner.dat from this package to turn it into full Business version.

But, I don't know if those 2 files need to be replaced with newer cracked ones if new CCleaner comes out."
