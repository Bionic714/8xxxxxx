This is better than Game of Thrones

If you disagree I will have your head on a pike

I am just watching the train wreck to see how bad the magic gets.  Nanites made from today's tech, that can self-replicate (including power source), eat endless amounts of electricity (which would vaporize them if they even touched it), and can even repair human cells (and therefore kill everyone on the planet simultaneously when their code gets corrupted)?  

Cryogenically freeze yourself for the next 5000 years and some of that might actually be getting *close* to being possible.  We cannot build any aspect of a 300 nm machine with those capabilities, especially the wifi capable computer system that receives the code from the USB pendants.  Pure magic.

BTW, Book 4 of GoT was pure filler (aka crap).  So perhaps you were thinking of that?  Even so, it was better since it stays true to it's design, while this was repeatedly claimed to be SciFi and is anything but.

I hope tonight they show how the nanites can be used to repair the cells of the resistance members using a modified pendant.  It would turn the show into a video game, where just hiding behind a wall heals your bullet wounds.  Whee!"

you're ranting about how this is unrealistic and that game of thrones is better,   because magic and dragons is so realistic...

and for someone who doesnt like the show, you are pretty far into the season and know a lot about it."
