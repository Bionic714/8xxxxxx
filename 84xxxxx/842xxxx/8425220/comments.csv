,gengleong,2013-04-30T15:32Z,Please seed... I'm getting 1kB/s -_- 
,Shioxx,2013-05-01T19:10Z,"@gengleong I dont know if what i say is correct, but i've noticed  when i try to download from networks with a poor ratio basicly download more then upload i get shitty speeds.
Maybe i'ts got something with that to do?
But remember not sure about this.
It can also be your firewall that blocks the speed. Or your router (had this problem)
Can also be malware."

,MrTTAO,2013-06-01T05:17Z,"what version is this?
Release version (and FLT release) was 1.07.
Latest version I found on TPB at the moment is 1.11.
Current version is actually 1.12."
,MrTTAO,2013-06-01T05:53Z,"Confirmed this to be V1.07B
Aka the original release version which is horribly buggy. There is a v1.11 available currently on TPB so use it instead."
