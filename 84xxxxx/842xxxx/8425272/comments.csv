[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-30T17:18Z,"i have the gnawing concern that dan slott will just shit on miguel o'hara as he's shat upon peter parker. if it was peter david bringing back miguel, i'd be stoked. i'm still pleased... just concerned he'll be mishandled by these idiots."
,Ahlat,2013-04-30T18:18Z,Thank you STFmaryville!
,Ahlat,2013-04-30T18:19Z,"Also, who scanned this?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-30T19:06Z,"Surely you know
Can't you tell?
An early release
No tag posted on it
But fuzzy quality on a
Really controversial story
Of course it came from...?????"
,BruceWayneJr,2013-04-30T23:16Z,"Nice Scan, Bro. ;)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T01:48Z,I guess Slott is getting hammered via Twitter again:  http://images.4chan.org/co/src/1367346583037.jpg
,Dr.Gonzo1982,2013-05-01T06:52Z,"Soooo...Now that the only reason I was reading this shit hole comic has been snuffed, I don't think I'll be reading it anymore..Dan Slott is a dirty dirty cunt rag. ""Oh, the hero and friend we've known for YEARS just loses his shit out of nowhere and starts MURDERING people along with talking and acting strange? Seems legit"" SHOULD SAY NO ONE IN THE MARVEL UNIVERSE. Besides that, thanks as always for the upload."
,Ahlat,2013-05-01T10:12Z,"I should have know it was by ScanBro. 
I feel like the black sheep here for enjooying this series. Though, this issue I felt was pretty lacklustre."
,BruceWayneJr,2013-05-01T12:40Z,"You're not alone, Ahlat. I'm not silly enough to think this is gonna last forever, and I'm not gonna call the writer stupid names over a finite storyline. 

I will say that this story has been spinning it's wheels, and that I'm ready for the conflict (Avengers and Carlie Cooper) to kick in."
,Ahlat,2013-05-01T15:37Z,"Well I'm excited for the next issue, the solicits mention Green Goblin!"
,Torrenad000,2013-05-02T03:50Z,Thanks for the upload. Ugh it looks like they're gonna drag out this storyline till the next ASM movie  at least. Damn shameless marketing ploy if you ask me.
