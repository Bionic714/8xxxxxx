Everything the chess player wanted to know but was afraid to ask.
This one is well-written and reliable. It is a good choice for library collections.
Each section of this book could have a different audience. There is useful advice on using chess computers, explanations of ratings, clarifications of tournament rules, descriptions of timing options, and more.
One section which stands out is the one on Openings. It explains practical openings in words and gives illustrative games.
The information here is generally superior to Pandolfini's book on chess trivia, but it can be hard to locate. This is really a book for browsing. It is very readable.
