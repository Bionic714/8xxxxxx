,MissAnaMatronic,2013-04-30T23:33Z,"@strgaza. I dont mean to be rude but God you piss me off with your constant asking for the NewNoW Next Awards on Logo tv. Its not the full show, its just short tiny clips not worth watching. The full show isnt anywhere to watch on a website. It would of been on American tv but thats it."
,MissAnaMatronic,2013-04-30T23:44Z,"For all the cranky Drag Race fans that were so mad they couldnt download episode 12 on here last week. It was available last Tuesday but under the spelling of RuPaul's drag race with an appostrophy on RuPauls, so (Rupaul's) instead of the regular will bring up last weeks episode episode 12. There was no untucked last week and same as this week. Last week was the final episode and they chose to not do an untucked but that is the same as last year. Then Episode 13 this show here is just the 'best bits' of the entire season show they do every year. Not a normal episode. Then next week its the reunion show where they also crown the winner! How Exciting, how Exciting! Team Alaska Thunderfvck, I was team Jinx for ages so catch up bitches and realise your voting on Jinkx as the underdog who got picked on from the way it was edited. Jinkx and Alaska are equally funny but Alaska is better to look at and more polished. Who would you honestly go pay money to see for an hour , Jinkx looking a hot mess or Alaska and Sharon performing their new song they did together off Sharons Album, ""Lets have a kai kai"". Sharon and Alaska were touring Australia last month for all you Australians reading this. Promoting Sharon's new album, PG13. I was in shock I found out too late!"

,MissAnaMatronic,2013-05-01T00:02Z,"Thankyou for the download. What happened last week? Thats the first one you havnt put up. Can you imagine all the people on here clicking on and off for days straight checking for it and it never appeared,coz your the only one who posts it on the net thats findable. I had to pay for the proper version of hidemyass to hide my vpn to hide my country as I am from Australia and watched it off Logo. Its only 11.95 for one month if you ever need to do that people. It saved me this month and you get to watch it at around 6pm Aus time, about 6 hours after it airs in America which is awesome."
,nrdcskb,2013-05-02T14:36Z,"@MissAnaMatronic thank you for your info, I found the episodes I was missing by changing my search to ""Rupaul's"". I'm also in Australia, I can't believe I also missed Sharon & Alaska! My 11 year old daughter LOVES them!"
