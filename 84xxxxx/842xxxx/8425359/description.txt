Bio Excerpt from All Music:

... The group recorded for Liberty for four years, from 1961 through 1965, even doing their versions of several Beatles songs, but apart from a pair of minor hits, "My Little Girl" and "Please Don't Ever Change", were unable to generate any enthusiasm. One of Naylor's successors, David Box, died in a plane crash during 1964. They did find some lingering success in England, and the group even managed to appear in two jukebox movies on either side of the Atlantic, Just For Fun (1963) in England (doing "My Little Girl" and "Teardrops Feel Like Rain") and The Girls On The Beach (1965) in America (doing "La Bamba"), but by the end of the 1960's, Mauldin had left music while Allison was singing lead; he and Curtis were also working as session musicians, and Curtis scored a huge success at the dawn of the 1970's as the composer of the theme song for The Mary Tyler Moore Show. ...

All Music Album Review:

Thirty-one cuts of post-Buddy Holly material from his band The Crickets, who endured into 1965 on Liberty Records. Their energetic pop/rock sound often mirrored whatever trends were happening at the time.
