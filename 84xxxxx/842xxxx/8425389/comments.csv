I loved Hawk and Dove. Still remember being shocked to find that Hank Hall was Monarch in the big Armageddon series.....I don't suppose you have that series on hand?

Thanks for the upload :-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T15:31Z,"one of these days i'd like to compile a bunch of the old summertime annual crossovers (marvel's evolutionary war, atlantis attacks, and dc's armageddon 2001, eclipso: the darkness within).

the astoundingly convoluted triple-retcon of the end of armageddon 2001 (in extreme justice and later in jsa) that made captain atom into monarch gives me a headache just thinking of it.

volume 1, the ditko hawk and dove, is on my list."
