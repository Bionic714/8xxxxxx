Hi,

The nice thing of looking for good music, I like to play for my customers, is the fact I come across a lot of really wonderful songs. This month especially. After listening to some 5400 tracks, I was left with about 300 suitable tracks. So some did not make the playlists. These tracks (too good to be forgotten) are included in the two kind of unsorted lists (I9). Also included the first real dance list (I4) as a bonus (contains some older material).... Enjoy (The first lists blessed by King Willem Alexander and Maxima),

Tip: Try to get the SAG lists. The only really good quality (electro Rock) lists I found, but hard to get. The other lists are downloaded anyway.

For the complete specs just download (tracks are 100% clean and fully labeled) or see Kickass. PB causes some DB Errors. Probably too much data.
