Apparently, you have to play until chapter 1 and then the LAN option will be available."

he probly got some renamed crack off the Skidrow fan boy web site

all issues from reloaded is from not installing the ""redist"""
,0101neo0101,2013-04-30T16:21Z,"You may be right. But...
- 3DM crack v1 didn't save game progres to me
- 3DM crack v2 and Reloaded crack gave me ""0xc0000142"" launch error.

And this ""skidrow"" (or whatever) crack solved all that problems to me. Now i'm playing happily.

This has ""skidrow"" named archives inside and I really don't care who made it as long it works. And this worked to me.

So call it wherever you want, just some people asked for this crack when i commented it on other torrents, so the most usefull thing i thought was to share it with all of you.

You could have told the ""redist"" solution to ALL the people who was having problems with reload crack when they came here looking for help anyway (by the way, I installed redist and the problems didn't solve).

Enjoy."

,MikeO89,2013-05-03T06:48Z,Idiots like this is what gives Pirate Bay a bad name. Stupid ass single uploader doesn't even know what he uploads and then thinks someone is going to believe him. Too many dip shits like this upload here for their 15 minutes of fame. Fuck you dude. Go get fucked in the ass again by your boyfriend.
,e3y0re,2013-05-04T09:17Z,"Probably talking about the RELOADED crack linked on the skidrow site. If you don't trust this file, just Google: Skidrow riptide crack

The first link has a link to ""Crack Only - Reloaded"" which is probably what this is."
,e3y0re,2013-05-04T09:18Z,"^ Fair warning, don't download the actual game from that site though. It comes with a Generic32.BZAA trojan."
