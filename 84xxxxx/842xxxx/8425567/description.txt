Iron Man 3 2013 CAM XViD - JUSTiCE

SOURCE: Beowulf / MiLLENiUM

Video and audio both cleaned and given justice
Check sample and see

Video had plenty of faults from movement,glares,colouring bleeding etc
So opted to rotate and use the perspective filter to find a better balance first off
will be honest and say due to camera movement it doesn't stay level throughout
Once sorted i had to crop the odd borders this made ...only 3-5 pixel here and there
Then to sort the noise out i had to smoother a fair bit ..more than normal,but this
needed to be done 
Also lowered the sat right down to almost black and white ...and from there i used the
rgb eq to rebuild the colours back up

Audio ...MUCH better than the old source,so top work guys 
Found the audio was oos around 1hr 14mins over my encode so cut and adjusted
From there we cleaned it in adobe by changing the eq bands aswell as using a hiss removal filter
