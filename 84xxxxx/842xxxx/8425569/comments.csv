,KevinCostner,2013-04-30T18:42Z,Nice Quality but it has Hard Coded Korean Subs
,jersan,2013-04-30T21:33Z,"Is the whole movie there,the last 20 minutes ?"
,KevinCostner,2013-05-01T01:11Z,"Looks like it to me, run time is 2 hours & 8 minutes, full credits roll at the end."
,michaelrwatson,2013-05-02T04:19Z,"This is also splattered with other Korean watermarks.

To xxxlavalxxx and the Korean scum who released this rip: Your mothers do tricks for Chinese soldiers."
,hatepig,2013-05-02T06:13Z,"Probably because the source is Korean you ignorant fuck. If you don't like it go fucking find it and upload it yourself. As for your mom, I wouldn't be surprised if she was also your sister."
,mangosprout,2013-05-03T02:17Z,"It's Chinese, not Korean, you entitled whiny fucks."

,vikingman11,2013-05-11T06:19Z,"A9/V9. DVD quality. Has hard subs but they aren't that distracting. Per IMDB movie is 128 minutes, so it is all there. Thanks uploader!"
,bluesborn,2013-05-11T07:29Z,@mrsknowitall- oh look another racist cunt.How original.
,ChasUGC,2013-05-13T22:12Z,"It's funny and sad how every movie about a successful African-American is filled with bigotry and racism. Then, I read the comments here, and I see its still a problem even in 2013. Its sad that even in 2013 we still have bigotry and racism. With all the technology in this world there are people still living in the dark ages. I guess some minds stay small and unenlightened regardless of the technological advances."
