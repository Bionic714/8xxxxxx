.:RELEASE NOTES:.

VirtualDJ is the hottest MP3 mixing software,
targeting every DJ from bedroom DJs to professional
superstars like Carl Cox.
With its breakthrough BeatLock engine, your songs
will always stay in the beat, and you can work your
mixes incredibly faster than any other DJ could.

The automatic seamless loop engine and the brand new
synchronised sampler will let you perform astounding
remixes live, with no preparation at all. The visual
representation and the cues allow you to clearly see
the song's structure, and never be surprised by a
break anymore. The vinyl controls will let you
scratch like on a real turntable, except that with
the beatlock engine your scratches will never end
out of the beat.

Add to that an infinite number of cue points you can
save for each songs, a bunch of wonderful effects
automatically beat-synchronised.
