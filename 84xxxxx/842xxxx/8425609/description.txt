Prophecy Answers Mini Seminar - David Asscherick

6 videos:

In this mini seminar David Asscherick describes how and why the Bible is real, the prophecies are accurate, and he does so in just 6 hours. He states that if someone could have sat him down and explained the Bible's prophecies in a short amount of time he would have quite possibly been a Christian many years earlier than finding out on his own.

Now, no one is asking you to fill out a pledge card for the church but, the evidence presented here could not be more pertinent than it is today, in our time, which David points out according to prophecy we are living in the end times.

David also touches upon global warming in video 3, he states that the evidence for global warming is real & accurate. And many people have different opinions on the facts behind global warming. He is trying to illustrate that things are going wrong everywhere. Please don't allow this to influence you about all other information concerning which he is correct.
