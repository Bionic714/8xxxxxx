For years, Cory Morrow has talked the talk and walked the walk all across his beloved Texas, and with the 12 songs on his powerhouse new album Brand New Me, he gives us every mile of that musical journey in a highly autobiographical set which is already thrilling country radio and his huge army of fans.

"Brand New Me is as happy an album as I've ever made, and also the first sober album I've ever made. I dont have to have the drugs anymore to get out what I have to say," says Morrow, whose life and career changed forever when he was arrested in January, 2005.

Police charged him with drunk driving at over 100 miles per hour, and possession of cocaine.

"I was found not guilty, but I'll tell you there were incidents that led up to that kind of thing happening," says Cory, who believes the frightening and humiliating experience saved his life. "I think the Lord works in beautiful and mysterious ways."

One beautiful way came soon afterwards, when mutual friends introduced Morrow to a lovely, strong Christian woman named Sherry. The couple soon married. "She's wonderful, and thats impacted my writing ever since and the way I want my shows to be," Morrow says. "I want to be more of a positive influence, and to take more of an encouraging stance."

In challenging times like these, thats a message that resonates strongly with fans and listeners.

Lloyd Maines, the legendary Texas pedal steel virtuoso and producer, both played on and produced Brand New Me on APEX Nashville/Write On Records, which includes 10 tunes Cory wrote or co-wrote and a pair of fascinating covers, Jackson Browne's "Doctor My Eyes", and Waylon Payne's "Running From The Rain".
