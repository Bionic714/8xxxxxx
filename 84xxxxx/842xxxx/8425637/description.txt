Don Ross returns with his 14th solo album. This time around he revisits some songs from his first three albums from 20+ years ago, along with some new originals. ItΓÇÖs always interesting to see how artists take on earlier works.


Right from the get-go the track that stood out for me was Wall of Glass, which Don has already recorded twice before (by my count). For this recording heΓÇÖs joined by his wife Brooke Miller, and the result is a very lively and inspired rendition. BrookeΓÇÖs vocal harmonies really add that something extra to the composition that helps take it to a new level.

Another track which I really liked was the solo version of Run, DonΓÇÖt Walk. It was originally recorded as a full-band arrangement on the ΓÇ£Three HandsΓÇ¥ album, but honestly, I like the new version much better.

The other two older tracks which Don revisits are New Aaron and Silversmith, and theyΓÇÖre both played pretty faithfully to how they were originally recorded. The biggest difference lies in the modern production (brighter and louder), which for me works better on New Aaron. For Silversmith I felt the original had a certain delicacy which is missing in the new version.

Of the new songs, the title-track is a catchy upbeat number which starts off the album in a great way.
