,deadcow1,2013-05-01T17:46Z,really nice movie. didn't expect it at all.
,euphya,2013-05-01T18:27Z,"wow. imdb isnt very descriptive in their plot line but I am glad it is that way because this movie was surprisingly great. I expected to turn it off after 5 minutes. Quality is great as well, DVD quality, 9/9...and this is nothing like gladiator Tegra3 lol"
,geertweggen,2013-05-02T07:37Z,very nice movie and quality Thanks
,aoxo,2013-05-02T08:41Z,So I made it to 20 minutes..then realized this is a pile of crap movie.  Then I realized I don't have anything to do so I'm going to try to force it down.  I'm already regretting that decision.  I think this is a scary movie for 15 year old girls.
,dfl3506,2013-05-02T13:24Z,"A10, V10 I can't believe all the comments saying what a great movie. Are you all 15 year old girls? Badly acted trite IMO."
,GeorgeMack,2013-05-02T14:39Z,"a villages with clothes and ""mentality"" from the 50's a kind of reference to Red State the word bat shit...:)  Obnoxious film, i lasted 40 minutes because although as a concept the film was quite interesting the characters were bloody awful, jeremy irons familiarizing yourself to the youth is a good idea, this one you should've skipped. Kudos to the uploader, facepalm to hollywood"

,briebee72,2013-05-02T20:02Z,a/v is rather good 9/9.. movie is not bad either. yes it another girly teen love story made to seperate young girls from their viginity .. but im thinking where all the good comments are coming from are from people who saw the host and what i pile of crap that was and then watched this and saw that hey this isnt so bad.  YES its a girl movie YES its all teeny bop .. if you are a guy do not download this unless you are trying to get laid or gay. but for teen females yes it is not a bad movie.. yes the story lines kinda messed up with all the 1950 ish religious persacution but thats the point of the story line so dont say they are trying to push some agenda thats just stupid.

the movie is very good and does a lot to build suspense until about 2/3 through the movie and then it begins to suck"
,RaZKaLz,2013-05-04T03:55Z,"The movie looks terrible, it doesn't even make the books credit... It flopped so there's no sequel for sure. The books are great though."
,crywolf_258,2013-05-04T04:54Z,good movie! but no subtitles??
,pawn3d,2013-05-07T09:50Z,"i honestly thought this was a ""made for tv"" movie... :/"
,Senesence,2013-05-08T10:20Z,"the books are pretty good the movie is decent but they omit a lot of details and they changed the characters a lot but other than than pretty decent movie, its nothing like twilight as the acting was pretty good without which the movie would have sucked for sure.

M- Man, if this is what people consider a good movie... well, I'd cut my balls off if I thought this was a good movie.

Haven't people got over the ""Twilight"" crap yet? fuckn' christ."
