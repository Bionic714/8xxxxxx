[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T03:37Z,"i'm a fan of art books too, Calel1234. this book focuse solely on cover art, but honestly, those are the most worthwhile pages of the GFT series.

if you've never read the ""modern masters"" series published by twomorrows, it's a great series on comic artists, their lives, and their processes. you can probably still find some of them here on TPB."
