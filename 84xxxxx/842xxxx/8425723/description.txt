My first torrent...

Ar Tonelico: Melody of Elemia ps2 iso

Just simply burn the image and your modded PS2 will play it

or 

You can use PCSX 2.0 emulator on PC. I tested, works like charm

More info about the game:

I fount this game quiet fun, if you love JRPG games, you will like this one as well.
Also please seed it back at least 3:1 ratio since this is a very rare game.
Comments are welcome!
