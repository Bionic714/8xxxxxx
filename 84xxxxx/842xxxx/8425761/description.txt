In nature, everything  works 
according to set laws. It is the 
same in the spiritual realm: 
God acts according to laws. So 
often we get discouraged and 
believe that prayer is useless 
when our prayers do not get 
answered. However, the actual 
reason  is that we have not 
fulfilled God's laws which are a 
condition for prayer.



1. The Law of a Pure Heart
 
2. The Law of a Forgiving Spirit
 
3. The Law of the Right Motive

4. The Law of Faith
 
5. Pray According to the Will of God
 
6. Praying in the Name of Jesus
 
7. Praying in the HolySpirit
 
 Provided that we walk in the Spirit, nothing will be impossible to us.
