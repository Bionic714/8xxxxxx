If there was any question about Josh AbbottΓÇÖs intention as a Texas country artist, he answers it on ΓÇÿSmall Town Family Dream,ΓÇÖ his third studio album. Actually, he doesnΓÇÖt just answer the question, he pulls a hot poker out of the fire and brands his love for the Lone Star state across his chest, back and arms. ThereΓÇÖs no doubt where the Josh Abbbott Band frontmanΓÇÖs loyalty lies.

He also makes his disdain for Nashville clear. ΓÇÿIΓÇÖll Sing About MineΓÇÖ is the albumΓÇÖs flagship song. Those who agree with his evaluation of Music City will likely enjoy what he has to say on the remaining 10 songs (11 if you get the bonus track). The singer gets personal when singing that ΓÇ£Tractors ainΓÇÖt sexyΓÇ¥ during his assault on country radio. ΓÇ£The radio is full of rich folks singing about places theyΓÇÖve never seen,ΓÇ¥ he adds soon after.

ΓÇÿFlatland FarmerΓÇÖ offers the same message with more artistry than ΓÇÿIΓÇÖll Sing About Mine.ΓÇÖ From there, songs like ΓÇÿDallas LoveΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿMy TexasΓÇÖ (featuring Pat Green) pour cement over any ideas that Abbott is looking to go mainstream.

Vocally, Abbott is limited, but he makes the most of his talents with honest and urgent stories of small town America. A few songs that get overlooked amongst the Texas love letters are perhaps the best on the album (available now). ΓÇÿIdalou,ΓÇÖ ΓÇÿShe Will Be FreeΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿRain Finally Coming DownΓÇÖ come with sharp, imaginative lyrics that more than make up for pedestrian melodies. There are a few moments ΓÇö specifically during the chorus of ΓÇÿHotty ToddyΓÇÖ ΓÇö where Abbott sounds like a young Garth Brooks. Whether or not this is a compliment to a singer focused on railing against ΓÇ£the establishmentΓÇ¥ isnΓÇÖt clear, but it certainly should be.
