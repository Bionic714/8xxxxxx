[V],HighCode,2013-05-01T13:51Z,"Thx joegi50, such comments encourage uploaders to keep seeding longer, while such comments as the ones from ""STAR WARS CLONE WARS S1 - S4..."" & ""James Bond Complete Collection 1962-2012 BDRip 1080p..."" put us off..."
,dalesteyn,2013-05-02T22:42Z,"i don't know if u take requests...but if u do..then please encode 1080p of ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER(http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/All-About-My-Mother-Blu-ray/16789/)
i can't even find a source on my own...but im sure there are certain differences btwn mine n ur searching process...and if it doesn't work,i just wanna tell that i would love any pedro almodovar movie like BROKEN EMBRACES,VOLVER,BAD EDUCATION...around 4-5gb...hope im not asking too much!!!"

You find the BDRemux (17 GB) at p2pdl.com
Todo sobre mi madre (1999) BDRemux VC-1 DTS-HD MA 5.1
I will encode it in about 10 days to 1080p (~5 GB).
I'll upload La Mala Educacion 2004 in a day or two to p2pdl, where I release my torrents."
