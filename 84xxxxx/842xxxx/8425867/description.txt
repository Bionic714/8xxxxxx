---(NOTES)----

For the video we have used the FRE transfer for its superior PQ over the US/GER BD
(US and GER BD both have the same audio and video). It features a fake-interlaced
video stream at 24 fps. However, the FRE BD has only a lossy DTS-HD HR audio, so we
used the lossless DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track from the US BD. In order to sync both
we had to set the video framerate to 24/1001 in mkvmerge.

If your hardware does not support Matroska frame rate flags, your only other option
would be to re-encode the video stream with AssumeFPS(24000,1001). Speeding up the
US audio to 24 fps is a no option as it may distort the audio / create undesired
audio artifacts.

Subtitles from all three sources have been synced and muxed together.

Since the US source does not provide named chapters, the chapters were taken from
the GER source, translated into English and synced accordingly.

Thanks to the original uploaders for the sources!

---(NOTES)----

For the video track we have used what we believe to be the CAN Blu-ray source, that
features 24 fps VC-1 (thanks to RUT!) as it offers slightly better PQ over the US
VC-1 transfer.

However, the CAN BD uses only a lossy DTS-HD HR audio track, so for audio we used
the lossless DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio track from the US source. In order to sync video
and audio we had to set the video track frame rate to 24/1001 in mkvmerge. If your
hardware does not support Matroska frame rate flags, the other option would be to
re-encode the video stream with AssumeFPS(24000,1001).

The subtitles have been synced accordingly.
