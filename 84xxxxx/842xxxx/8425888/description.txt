The complete recording, originally issued as a 4 LP set in 1963, of the original Broadway cast (Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, George Grizzard and Melinda Dillon) performing Edward Albee's landmark play. This is a transfer from Columbia's open-reel edition of the play - so there are NO pops, ticks or crackles. Out of print for many decades and NEVER issued on CD.
