,fakeshemp85,2013-05-06T04:36Z,"Missing some part in the beginning.  Around page 24 on my nook, the sentence just stops."
,fakeshemp85,2013-05-07T01:42Z,Anyone else have this same problem?  Anyone have a complete one?
[T],TxJag,2013-05-07T17:46Z,"@fakeshemp85

This is a complete retail copy. I've uploaded this in other places as well and I haven't heard one complaint so it's possibly on your end."
,fakeshemp85,2013-05-07T23:35Z,"When I view it in Calibre it shows part of it missing.  Not sure how much, but it ends in the middle of the sentence at the end of chapter two and three."
[T],TxJag,2013-05-08T05:05Z,"@Fakeshemp85

Damn, I bought this retail. Let me look into it."
[T],TxJag,2013-05-08T05:50Z,"@FakeShemp85

This is DEFINITELY a publisher issue cause I verified the kindle sample, the DRM free AZW3 in Calibre, AND the converted ePub and they ALL have the same issue. This is evident through out the book. So unfortunately this is something I can't fix :("
[T],TxJag,2013-05-08T15:13Z,"@fakeshemp85 here is a tweet received from William Morrow: ""certain chapters of the book end abruptly like that. it's a stylistic choice the author made."""
,fakeshemp85,2013-05-08T23:49Z,Thanks.  Did look into in further as well and the chapter ends in mid-sentence and the rest of the sentence is the next chapter title.
,fakeshemp85,2013-05-10T22:24Z,Can you do the rest of Joe Hill's work?
[T],TxJag,2013-05-12T23:55Z,"@fakeshemp85 maybe next week. I got a few books coming out tomorrow that I have to prepare for, including Inferno by Dan Brown"
,*reagan*,2013-06-08T14:44Z,Thank you TxJag. Great work as always.
