First biography paragraph from All Music (by John Bush):

He launched his career as a fill-in for the recently deceased Buddy Holly, Bobby Vee scored several pop hits during the early '60s, that notorious period of popular music sandwiched between the birth of rock & roll and the rise of the British Invasion. Though a few of his singles -- "Rubber Ball," for one -- were as innocuous as anything else from the era, Vee had a knack for infectious Brill Building pop, thanks to his ebullient voice as well as the cadre of songwriters standing behind him.

All Music Album Review (by Al Campbell):

The Very Best of Bobby Vee captures 30 of the teen idol's Brill Building pop songs originally recorded for Liberty in the early to mid-'60s, including "Devil or Angel," "Rubber Ball," "The Night Has a Thousand Eyes," and Vee's biggest hit from 1962, "Take Good Care of My Baby." The casual listener will be pleased with the choice of material presented on this disc, but collectors should check out the numerous two-fer reissues of Vee's original albums on Collectables and the U.K.-based Beat Goes On label.
