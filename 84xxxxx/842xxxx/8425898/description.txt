Jungle Hero (BBC)

Nature Documentary hosted by Bill Bailey, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Bill Bailey heads to the jungles of Indonesia in the footsteps of his hero, Victorian naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, to understand how he came up with the theory of evolution independently of Darwin. Wallace was a brilliantly eccentric British explorer and, unlike Darwin, he came from a humble background and had to pay his own way by collecting animals. He survived months living in the jungle, man-eating tigers, and headhunting tribes to scoop Darwin to the theory of evolution. Wallace changed the way we see life on earth but has since been written out of history.


1)  Wallace in Borneo 
Bill retraces Wallace's explorations from the jungles of Borneo to the exotic islands of Indonesia, encountering orangutans, flying frogs and extraordinary bugs, on a mission to understand how Wallace came up with the theory of evolution, and to win him the recognition he deserves.

2)  Wallace in the Spice Islands 
Bill ventures to Indonesia's remote Spice Islands. Wallace was a bug collector who survived pirate attacks, boating disasters and malarial fevers to change the way we see life on earth. Independently of Charles Darwin, he came up with the theory of evolution by natural selection. But he has since been forgotten. In the second of this two-part series, Bill encounters boggle-eyed tarsiers, monkeys with mohicans and spectacular birds of paradise on his mission to understand how Wallace cracked evolution.
