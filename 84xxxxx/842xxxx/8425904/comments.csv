,asaharaya,2013-05-07T21:44Z,"@strgaza: If you use Mozilla Firefox, you can use this add-on called ""Modify Headers"" to watch the show on Logo TV official website even if you are outside US >> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/modify-headers/"
,asaharaya,2013-05-07T22:17Z,"Go to Google or YouTube and search for this video: ""How to watch the Daily Show and Colbert Report Outside the US"" (apparently TPB didn't allow me to insert YouTube link). Then follow the tutorial. If you do it right, you can watch the show even if you live outside US. I live outside US too and that's what I did to watch it."
,asaharaya,2013-05-07T22:26Z,"After doing the steps given in the tutorial you can go to the NewNowNext 2013 awards full episode here >> http://www.logotv.com/video/2013-logo-newnownext-awards/1705524/playlist.jhtml (by that you can watch the show without downloading it).

Hope that helps."
