,4nt1trt,2013-04-30T19:29Z,This update is about final. I dont think we have v6 update. So mercs mode depends on this. If not -> tanx for effort reloaded!
,raymondtfr,2013-05-01T19:14Z,So this update contains all the previous updates?
,raymondtfr,2013-05-01T19:18Z,"This one contains all the previous 1, 2, 3, 4 updates?"
,4nt1trt,2013-05-02T18:40Z,sending records data fixed?
,kissmon,2013-05-03T13:55Z,does this update fix the mercenaries sending data freeze?
,kissmon,2013-05-03T17:12Z,"I still have the ""Sending Records Data"" freeze in mercenaries, anyway thanks for uploading this.

@raymondtfr you don't need the previous updates. just extract the files to your install folder, after that copy-paste and replace the crack in your install directory"
,texicwaste,2013-05-05T17:43Z,this bull s**t. the Chris level cannot be completed because the ammo and health do not work. without the rocket launcher you cannot defeat the helicopter   so you cannot get through the level. sucky. lousy crack all the way through. lousy updates that do nothing.
,kissmon,2013-05-12T06:31Z,"So far I haven't encountered any bugs. My sister and I completed Chris' campaign and we're currently playing Jake's campaign. We've been busy with split-screen mercenaries lol xD (google resident evil 6 tunngle if you want mercs too. there's a complete guide there)


(We're using windows 8 32-bit if that helps)."
,NatalieOoi,2013-05-14T02:49Z,"@texicwaste I have completed the Leon, Helena, Ada, Helena, Piers Nivens and Sherry Birkin's story without encountered any problems except the death before the cut scene where Leon and Helena chasing after the cloned Ada Wong... After the update 1, everything works.

So I guess you DO NOT need a Rocket Launcher to beat that chopper... lol... All you need is the Grenade Launcher. (http://residentevil.wikia.com/Grenade_Launcher_%28RE6%29)"
,NatalieOoi,2013-05-14T02:52Z,"By the way, why Capcom love to force the fans to buy original version to play the Mercenaries mode? Can't they set the Mercenaries mode like Resident Evil 5, where we can choose to play offline and online? Because it's not fair to those who bought the game offline. Beside, not everyone is rich in this world, they need to think about those people who is not rich."
,sixor,2013-05-15T06:57Z,"works fine, thanks

,huracan500,2013-05-18T17:02Z,"Thank for this, works fine."
,CMS93,2013-05-21T20:34Z,"@NatalieOoi for those of us who can't afford a game, there's a magical solution called getting a job."
,jpweb72,2013-05-22T21:01Z,tell me where is the magical solution coz in portugal we have no jobs even magical ones all the fairies are unemployed
