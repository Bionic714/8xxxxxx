John Schlesinger followed his iconic Midnight Cowboy with this deeply personal take on love and sex. Sunday Bloody Sunday depicts the romantic lives of two Londoners, a middle-aged doctor and a prickly thirtysomething divorc√©e-played with great sensitivity by Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson - who are sleeping with the same handsome young artist (Murray Head). A revelation in its day, this may be the seventies' most intelligent, multitexured film about the complexities of romantic relationships.
