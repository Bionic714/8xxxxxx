The Edmund Gregory (Sahib Shihab) discography is available elsewhere 

at (TPB) in lossy thanks to a kind uploader but I feel that redundancy is justified

in this case.  I will be enjoying that discography as time allows me to.


This UP includes (2) sextet sessions from 1957.  Famed participants include

Bill Evans, Oscar Pettiford, Paul Chambers, Benny Golson and Phil Woods.




FROM "liner"FOLDOUT (included):   "Sahib Shihab is a big man around his big horn!

A virile bop exponent who can play with such a vengeance that he practically rips

the notes right out of the listener's stomach in the intensity of his 

swinging.........."



Hyperbole?   I sure hope so...my stomach's doing just fine the way it is



PS: my use of USB flash (thumb) drives has slowed things down but I'll try to

make amends
