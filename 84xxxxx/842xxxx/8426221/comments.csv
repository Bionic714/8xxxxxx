,abordeu,2013-05-01T21:06Z,"Hi Guys,

Zeno Clash 2 developer here reaching out to you. We expected the game to show up here so I wanted to drop a few lines and see if I can leave a message that hopefully sticks with some people. 

First of all I wanted to remind everyone that our studio, ACE Team, is a small independent company, and unlike bigger companies in our medium we are more vulnerable if our games don’t sell well. I was personally shocked when I read in more than one review that because we were making a sequel this implied that our company must be prosperous and that we’d grown up into a much larger studio.  At ACE Team we are only 15 very talented guys (look at the opening credits) and we’ve invested nearly two years dedicating countless hours and effort and resources in creating this game. We don’t have the luxury of making games that don’t sell.

Before saying anything further I thank you for your interest in our game. I know it’s strange to write this here, but I’m sure that if you reached this page it’s because you are looking for a game that’s different and that takes chances. But if you really want to see more games like this one, if you want us to keep on making games like this I urge you to pick up a paid copy. The people at our forums say they are having a great time with the game and we’ve developed a great relationship with them. We’re going to be giving a lot of post release support that goes beyond just bug fixes: new features, game modes and whatever we can think of. You’ll probably miss out on all that if you download the game on sites like these. So again, please buy the game and help support small, independent developers like us. We owe everything to the fans that are behind us and we’d love to count with you guys too.

Thanks for reading this!
Andres Bordeu
ACE Team"
,rainerlagstyle,2013-05-01T21:57Z,"@ Andres - You're doing it right. People are here to demo your game, you just made 2 sales by not being a douche about it. Just picked up a copy for myself and the gf. Hope it's as good as your attitude."
,abordeu,2013-05-01T22:34Z,Thanks rainerlagstyle! Hope you enjoy it!
,Z3NN,2013-05-02T04:47Z,"@ Andres This is how all developers should deal with piracy, I'll pick myself up a copy once I get paid."
,kingcover,2013-05-02T05:28Z,"YES!  Now that's the kind of attitude that will sell many copies.  I know you've definitely sold me even though I haven't downloaded it yet to try it.  I played Zeno Clash 1 and forgot about it so I think I'll just go ahead and purchase a copy of that one too if I can find one! I really like the fact that this developer is straight up and not afraid to speak his mind politely.  May the ACE Team make millions and provide us with more change in the gaming scene, lord knows we all need something different, and this team delivers! :D"
,abordeu,2013-05-02T20:25Z,Thanks guys! Glad the message is coming through. :)
,PseudoPositive,2013-05-03T03:21Z,"Can I buy a copy that IS NOT Steam, or has any other software related prerequisites?, I hate having to run a program in order to play a game, or needing the internet to register. If I can get a copy that simply allows me to install (Off line) & play, then I will buy the game."
,Babwin,2013-05-03T10:19Z,Where can I find the awesome music from the installer ?

Hi dude,

First I'm sorry for my english.

Dude I'm a big fan of you seens so much years, I was on your forum long time ago before Zeno Clash (first one) was realease. And I support you all the way I can. I buy the first game the week he was realease and i fall in love.
I have a lot of respect for you, and, like you know I download Zeno Clash 2. But is just because I don't have money for now I promess I will pay for the game cause it's great.
Can you just congratulate all the Ace team for your job from a stupid pirate in the strange network : The internet :P .

Good luck I will be happy the give a lot of money... if I can ;)"
,DefinitelyaLoser,2013-05-06T17:11Z,"Havnt played Zeno Clash before, and the game looks really sick, I just want to try it before I buy it on steam.Most of the games I really enjoyed i waited on  a sale on steam and purchased them. Latest game I bought was GodMode, recently released on steam, i first tried it here, I loved the game and bought me a  copy immediately. "
,Spindler328,2013-05-09T23:20Z,"@ Andres

From what I've played of this so far, it's a decent improvement over the first one which admittedly, I didn't -really- like.

It's good enough that come pay day, I'll be picking myself up a copy."

""independent company""
According to Steam Atlus is your publisher. Anyway, you should release on GOG."
,KoldPT,2013-05-10T02:27Z,"I really liked the first Zeno Clash. I pirated Rock of Ages and then bought it, but for this one, I think I'm gonna wait til I have some spare cash :D

Thanks for the great attitude, Andres, and good luck with your future games. We'll be here to play them."
