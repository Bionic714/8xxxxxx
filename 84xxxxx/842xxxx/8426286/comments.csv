[V],STFmaryville,2013-04-30T21:26Z,you're welcome downabhiload
,coyb85,2013-04-30T21:48Z,i cried a little reading this :'(
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T00:37Z,"his script is good at making you care about characters who are sometimes 2-dimensional and unlikeable in their ""real"" comics of the new 52."
,MrSammich,2013-05-01T03:52Z,"Hello, is there any chance you have a digital-TheGroup scan of TMNT 17 by IDW I cant seem to find one. Thanks"
,Bubbers83,2013-05-01T04:54Z,anyone know if Ame-Comi girls was canceled? I was kinda liking that series..
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T05:07Z,"MrSammich, as far as I can tell TheGroup didn't release that issue. The scan available on here (in http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7931625/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_017 ) which was done by Boco, is the only one I can find on any site."
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-05-01T08:15Z,"How about a post with the complete Justice League (International, America and Europe) by Keith Giffen and J.M. deMatteis?

I found this one very good: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4479684/Justice_League_International_and_Europe but, unfortunately, it is incomplete.

And, finally, when you have the time, consider posting the JLA Classified issues, if you have them."
,Ahlat,2013-05-01T10:14Z,Thank you STFmaryville! I found Nightwing's death hilarious. =P
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T14:41Z,"Ahlat you cold-hearted...! nah, it was pretty funny.

i was impressed, however, that taylor's story had hinted so heavily that damian would die only to twist at the end. and i do feel bad for bats, every time robin dies. which this is what-- the 4th time? but the first time it was done by another robin.

ggaanneesshhaa, all of those giffen/dematteis classics are in this excellent torrent:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6615963/  which also has the first (silver age) justice league of america series.

the same user has another torrent with the entire jla series and jla classified."
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-05-01T17:48Z,"Wow! The Justice League torrent is huge! I'll start downloading it right away. Thanks!

And regarding the torrent with the JLA/JLA Classified I think it's dead or stuck at some %. I gonna check it and tell you later, but I believe I already tried it a few months ago.

Finally, thank you again and excuse me if I'm giving you any trouble with my recent requests, ok?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T19:39Z,"it's no trouble. i try to fill all requests but sometimes it's easier to point you to a torrent already posted.  :-)

i tested http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6607085/  with JLA and JLA Classified. right now it has 4 people sharing 100% of the torrent, and i was getting d/l speed of about 7 kB/s. so it may take some time, but it's definitely still seeded."
,tdurden83,2013-05-02T06:44Z,"thx stf. just read it, I really liked what happened for the plot, but not so much the way it went down. it was weird to see a superhero go out in such a pedestrian way, but I guess it had to be some freak accident to work. still one of my favorite currents, and that mislead was cool. that superman/grundy panel was just plain awesome btw"
,nerdrage12,2013-05-02T06:58Z,Um... wow. I feel that Nightwing was totally disrespected. It's a shame the writers were so lazy with this issue.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-02T14:53Z,"i don't mean to sound condescending, but as silly as the way it happened was, one thing that *might* be overlooked is that it was foreshadowed in robin & nightwing's first appearance(s) in this series. (the scene was in the batcave, a few issues ago.)

but hey, you're right, it's a borderline disrespectful/absurd scene and it's certainly a different way to approach a major death. i look forward to seeing how they deal with it.  :-)"
,tdurden83,2013-05-02T17:16Z,"I don't take it that way at all, but ya, I caught how that added to damian's disbelief/horror. I have nothing against them, but i'm not especially attached to any of the bat-hangers-on, plus this is alternate. it was just way less climactic than all the build-up had me expecting. i'll give it to for being unexpected, and I still think it's great for the overall story"
,j5ize,2013-05-02T22:47Z,"Thanks alot, STFmaryville. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T00:35Z,you're welcome j5ize
,qskenzer,2013-05-03T02:41Z,Thanks for the up! Anybody have 15? I don't see it out on TPB
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T15:00Z,"it's on here. http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8403370/Injustice_-_Gods_Among_Us_015

tip: search injustice but limit your search to the comics section"
