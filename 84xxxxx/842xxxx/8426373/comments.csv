,armchair.53,2013-05-31T03:55Z,"and I'll add another comment having just downloaded the file... it all looks good.  A really good way to tell if a keygen is bad is to look at it's size; if it's small as this one is at 69 KB, it's fine.  On the other hand, if you see one that's 1000 KB or more - watch out... thanks again for sharing"
