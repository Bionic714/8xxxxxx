Tom Green's old talk show. Same format as any ye olde talk show - monologue, couple-a outdoor segments, some interviews and maybe a musical guest/comedian.

This episode has Dita Von Teese & Marilyn Manson, Andy Dick and Trishelle Cannatella.


Ripped by MahaSparna of lateshows dot net. He seems to be posting all of them from the second show up (sans three missing eps), so if you're interested - go there.
