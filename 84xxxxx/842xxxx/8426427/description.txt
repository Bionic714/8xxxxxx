Full look at the 2013 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, the without a doubt most anticipated issue of the magazine every year. The cover spot has been taken for the second year in a row by super model Kate Upton, but you can be sure that inside the issue many more top models are featured and are worth taking a look at.

Among the girls to be featured in the 2013 edition you find Adaora, Alana Blanchard, Alyssa Miller, Anne V, Ariel Meredith, Chrissy Teigen, Cintia Dicker, Emily Didonato, Eva De Goede, Ellen Hoog, Genevieve Morton, Hannah Davis, Irina Shayk, Jessica Gomes, Jessica Perez, Julie Henderson, Kate Bock, Michelle Jenneke, Natasha Barnard, Nina Agdal and - of course - Kate Upton.

The models were shot on 7 continents, resulting in some beautiful scenery.
