The May 2013 Issue of the worldΓÇÖs only monthly English-language magazine is out now! Get ready for summer with inspirational features to get your season rocking.  JC interviews windsurfingΓÇÖs living legend, Robby Naish, who reflects on a life in the sport on reaching his fiftieth birthday milestone.  

The Heading South movie project team and slalom pros Gonzalo Costa-Hoevel and Marco Lang invited JC on a stunning adventure in the scenic lakelands of Argentina.  Another mammoth swell produced conditions surpassing our recent trip to the islands so it was only right we revisited Sal, this time with the master of Curral Joul Josh Angulo and Kai Katchadourian.  Peter Volwater goes hard-core in West Oz with a visit to sail the gnarly surf breaks of Kalbarri.
