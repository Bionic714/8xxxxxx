"Inspiring and thought-provoking" ~ Richard Propes, The Independent Critic

When Army Journalist Sgt. Marshall Thompson comes home from Iraq, one thing is clear to him: he must speak out against the war. With the help of his family, he sets off on a 500-mile peace walk through Utah, perhaps the most hawkish state in the nation, in hopes of changing perceptions about the war. Throughout his journey, he meets other peace-minded people, as well as those who are vehemently opposed to his efforts. Regardless of your views on the Iraq War, A Soldier's Peace will leave you with something to think about.
