"Road to Zanzibar" is the second of the seven "Road" picture starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. Spoofing jungle movies, the trio finds itself in Darkest Africa in this 1941 jaunt. Politically incorrect from the titles on (look at the lips on those natives!), the film is a vast improvement over the earlier "Road to Singapore" (1940). The series peaked with the next two films, "Road to Morocco" and "Road to Utopia," but continue on through "Road to Hong Kong" in the early 1960s.
