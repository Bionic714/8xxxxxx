Penny Barber decides to step in for her team to give some relief to Audrey and help Cheyenne. However, Syd and Darling use their tags at the perfect moments and team dragon is robbed of a chance to win. Dragon uses all their tags early in the match which leaves Cheyenne out for almost half the round. Every time Cheyenne Gains control for team dragon, nightmare is able to get a tag. Frustration sets in for team dragon. Cheyenne holds her own against two elite wrestlers but it's not enough. Dragon falls further behind this season. There may be no hope for a come back.
