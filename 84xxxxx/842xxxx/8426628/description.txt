After the startling discovery that the classic film, Tenacious D and The Pick of Destiny was not released on Blu-Ray I began a quest to find a good HD copy of the film. The closest I found was a Russian rip of the film on Usenet that had terrible audio quality. The video quality was decent though, so I took the audio from the DVD release and put it all together for this final result. It looks and sounds a lot better than you would think.
