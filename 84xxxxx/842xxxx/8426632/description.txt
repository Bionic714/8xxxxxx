This is in response to a request for some Anne McCaffrey ebooks. All are in either mobi or epub format. If you need one or the other just download and use a free program called Calibre to change them into whatever format you need.
These are just taken from my personal ebook library and I cannot comment on them since I have never read them. I have built my library for friends and relatives who have Kindles and Nooks and it totals about 50,000 books so far.
I didn't provide a list since it is only 14 books and the author is listed. 

Enjoy!
