I couldn't tell by the description here, so appreciate the clarification  : )"
,TheLathe,2013-05-06T20:27Z,"Oh, the reason why I asked was because HIGH CODE who did a full BD post said himself that it was the Russian BD and that it was 'Okay' but he was waiting for the US release saying that he thought it would be better.

Any thoughts...?

Cheers!"
