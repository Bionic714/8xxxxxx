,galen_cathal,2013-05-02T15:23Z,Isn't this the same game as Strike Suit Zero? Because I was seeing screenshots and they look EXACTLY the same...
,AlucardD80,2013-05-03T01:07Z,"I tried to play it and it said fmodex.dll I then went to dllfiles.com and downloaded it, now it says fmod_event.dll not found, downloaded that and now it says some ridiculous stuff about a channel missing and such and such, sooooooo any help would be appreciated"
,AlucardD80,2013-05-03T01:09Z,Also I already did put the crack in the game location and used that .exe THEN thats when all of the fmodex etc etc... started happening
