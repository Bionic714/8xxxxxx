Ever notice how much of the music which survives THE TEST OF TIME sounds simple?

Musicians like "Sweets" Edison would never play 3 notes when a single note or even

silence could be more musical.  Such is the music of William Basie.  At the other

extreme are Lionel Hampton and Stephane Grapelli......great technical masters

of their instruments.  My ears get numb listening to their impossible, nearly

endless note flurries.  How pretentious of me to judge them.


This unusual trio setting for the Count is the sequel to this trio's first effort.

Unlike many movie sequels, musical "sequels" aren't as often BAD.  Basie is 

largely a bluesman IMO.  He was also a large bluesman.  Did Ray Brown ever make

a bad record?
