Since the first edition of Metric Pattern Cutting was published in 1975 to provide a straightforward introduction to flat pattern cutting, it has become the established textbook on the subject.

The fourth edition continues to offer an introduction to the basic principles of pattern cutting, with a range of good basic blocks and examples of their application to garments. The original blocks and many of the pattern adaptations have therefore been retained. However, the great expansion of casual wear, cut in jersey or stretch fabrics, has led to the growth of ΓÇÿflat cuttingΓÇÖ with no darting to create the shape and this edition devotes a whole section to this type of cutting. The sections on computer-aided design and grading have been updated. The size charts of body measurements have been revised, reflecting the changing shape of womenΓÇÖs bodies.
