,chb13,2013-05-01T04:31Z,Yes. And it's glorious. Many thanks to the uploader.
,burningcactus,2013-05-01T05:53Z,"This the acoustic companion album to streetlight manifesto's album the hands that thieve, from victory records. Victory records canceled the album due to copyright infringement, contractual issues etc. If you like the music, support the artist at http://riscstore.com/  Don't buy from Victory records. I'm fairly sure the only reason this is available at all here is because the artist wants it to be here. "
