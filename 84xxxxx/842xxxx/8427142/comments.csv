TY

Just in-case no one's explained it, this issue with 'SAVES' v/s 'CHECKPOINTS' in the game.
This game has many short checkpoints to go back to if you die.
If you leave the game to the main menu or desktop, you start at a 'SAVE' point. 
You must manually 'SAVE' you progress, before you exit, otherwise you start at a 'SAVE' point the game creates.
http://bayimg.com/hAmimaaEI
The 'SAVE' points are very FAR APART.
You may want to 'SAVE' before exiting the game to the main menu or desktop, this will restart you at the 'SAVE' point THAT YOU HAVE CREATED.

Seriously people, you can't be that stupid, and if you are,,,,,
You are using up vital air that the sick and old people need.
Go kill yourself, quickly.
We don't need to deal with MORE stupid fucktards you could create."

,dhencho,2013-05-06T06:05Z,Slow download fuck.
,swello,2013-05-06T18:07Z,"SOME advices:

1º First of all, there is no problem with Uplay, everyone who had or are having problem with cd key on uplay its because you don't know where to put the crack! You should put all contents inside the past ""crack"" on the bin ---> win32.

2º That first opening game advice "" Far cry is unavailable blá blá "" its normal to appear, you press Ok and you can play it normally.

3º The upload it's good, but probably not perfect. It's the first game that i had to configure before playing because it didn't recognize my GPU Nvidia driver! So be careful if you start the game and start to play with lag, low fps, and shitty graphics. 

4º The game is awsome, and for those who like retro style, ITS A MUST

,markunt,2013-05-08T18:40Z,"For noobs: Follow these instructions to the T and the game should work. 

1. Download torrent.
2. Mount the downloaded image file with DaemonTools or similar program OR burn the iso file to DVD and run it. 
3. Install the game normally, just follow the installation wizard. 
4. Open the ISO file you downloaded (rld-fc3bd) with WinRar and navigate to the ""Crack"" folder.
5. Move EVERYTHING from the crack folder to Blood Dragon's BIN folder, the file path will be something like ""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftFar Cry 3 Blood Dragonbin"" To move the stuff, either select it all and drag it into the BIN folder or extract to proper folder using WinRar.
6. When asked if you want to replace overlapping files, say YES. You want to replace the files existing in BIN with the similarly named files in the crack folder of your download. 
7. Play game. 
Tip: Not sure if it helps like in FC3, but I created a new desktop shortcut and added ""-offline"" to the end of the file path in properties to prevent the game from accessing the Internet without having to turn my actual Internet connection off.
Tip: If you're experiencing slow and out-of-sync cinimatics, open the graphics option menu and change the PostFX option to low or medium. Also consider turning off AA. 

Unlimited Ammo cheat: While I couldn't get the FC3 god mode cheat to work in BD, the unlimited ammo cheat works. To do the cheat, create a desktop shortcut, right-click, select Properties, add ""-GameProfile_UnlimitedAmmo 1"" to the end of the Target field. Make sure you leave a space between the actual target and the cheat code.

,X96legalize,2013-05-08T19:16Z,"So I haven't found the solution to this problem and I've looked everywhere... I've done like the description and @markunt said but still when trying to run the game, the uPlay shows up and makes the  game unplayable without a code. 
A solution how 2 play without shitty UPlay would be really appreciated."
,markunt,2013-05-08T20:04Z,"X96legalize- I don't know what to tell you, I followed my own instructions and never see anything about uPlay when launching the game. 

Did you create a new shortcut on your desktop AFTER copying the crack over to the BIN directory? If so, did you right-click, select ""Properties"" and add the ""-offline"" tag to the end of the target field? The final product should read something like (with quotation marks exactly as they are) ""C:Program Files (x86)UbisoftFar Cry 3 Blood Dragonbinfc3_blooddragon.exe"" -offline 

I'm not even sure if this step matters but if you followed all the actual steps I listed and it still isn't working, maybe this one was unclear and should have been a step instead of a tip. Hope this helps, it's an awesome game. "
,markunt,2013-05-08T20:06Z,"For some reason the comment system keeps deleting the slashes in path files. Step 5 of my first comment should read C:/Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon/bin Hopefully it works this time. If not, just imagine some fuckin dashes in there. "

,Mrwillgum,2013-05-09T07:16Z,okay i got it to work but my sniper scope dose not have a retical can someone help or should i get used to it 
,Mrwillgum,2013-05-09T07:24Z,By the way if its not working try installing it with a flash drive or external you should get 3 files in the external those files are bin/data_win32/support put the crack files in that bin folder and run the game through that bin folder (with the fc3_blooddragon application). this of course becomes obsolete if you know where these files are without the external.
,NerdMaster86,2013-05-09T11:32Z,"This works fine. You must put crack into binary folder of the game. 

Save game also works ! What you must do - finish first two main story missions (it will take about 1 hour) . After mission ""save the nerd"" go back to liberated garrison, press esc then save the game, it will work  from now on. Remember to press save  game before exiting."

Runs HOT (82c on GPU).  Pushes my SLI to 100% on both cards on high and ultra (lowering settings didn't lower usage).  Skyrim uses less GPU than this.  I guess making the graphics look like a throwback to games from 2000 and retaining all the nice stuff at the same time is costly.

The first time I played I had no audio during the ""movies"", adding the executable filename to ffdshow's audio codec ignore list fixed that.

You are using valuable air that the sick and old people need.
You are too stupid to be DLing software from here.
Go kill yourself.
Quickly!
BEFORE YOU PROCREATE!
And the rest of us have to deal with the fucktards you produce."

NECESSARY TIP FOR NOOBS WHO KEEP RUNNING INTO UPLAY ISSUE:

First off, if you already installed the game, and are continually running into the Uplay issue, uninstall both FC3BD and Uplay. Reinstall - Copy crack to bin folder - (MOST IMPORTANT STEP) - Finally, uninstall Uplay prior to playing game. Bingo!

,ShindoSama,2013-05-24T04:24Z,"I think the problem most people are having is that their anti-virus doesn't like some files in Blood Dragon (and in so many torrents as a whole) that it keeps quarantining and deleting them. make .dll files an exception to your anti-virus, and you should be fine. It works like a charm otherwise "
,FreeBandz.com,2013-05-25T00:22Z,"The torrent dosent seem to work for me still. I copied the crack and did everything correctly however, I get an error message that FC3 Blood Dragon has Stopped Working..."
,lorenz0117,2013-05-26T07:21Z,can someone please tell me how to disable my anti-virus for .dll files or take off restrictions for windows 8? mine doesn't work because the .dll file is rejected. Tnx
,hbody57,2013-05-26T10:41Z,"Can anyone confirm if there's a way to play this without uninstalling uPlay? I own Farcry 3 and Assassin's Creed 3, and play them regularly, so it's kind of a pain to have to keep uninstalling/reinstalling uPlay every time I want to play BD."
,Ryukojin,2013-05-26T13:47Z,"Downloaded, installed and finished the game, it works 100% confirmed :) just follow installation instructions :) thank you Mr.Stifmeister !"
,Boricua95,2013-05-28T03:39Z,Please Seed! Stuck at 50% :/
,RomWIz,2013-05-29T17:05Z,Thank you very much :D
,Dmix332,2013-06-03T00:53Z,"I installed both game and than the crack.

But than when I start up the game, it gives me Uplay and that i have to have a CDkey. 


what the fuck kind of crack is this.


im not a noob, this is bullshit."
,Lanfear,2013-06-07T18:38Z,"OK, I had the uplay login popup problem. I added exception for the dll file in MSE, didn't help. This is what I did: 

I uninstalled. Then I turned MSE protection off, closed firewall and turned off internet. Then I reinstalled.

I did not use the uplay shortcut on desktop after the install finishes, instead I made a new shortcut to the game exe file that launched the game (there are two, only one worked for me). Now it works, even after I started internet and the protection again! Maybe you can try this way if you have problems.

BTW, the save problem: You have to play all the way until after the ""save the nerd"" mission is done; then you can save manually. Now you can start from that save game next time!

Hope this helps someone."
,aman6585,2013-06-08T10:22Z,Game works fine but my mouse doesn't work when i load up the game. What did I do wrong?
