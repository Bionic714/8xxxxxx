The second of the Crosby-Hope-Lamour "Road" pictures find Bing and Bob in Darkest Africa. Faster and funnier than "Road to Singapore," "Zanzibar" set the stage for the best two films in the series - "Road to Morocco" and "Road to Utopia." As usual, the stars are con artists on the lam, having burned down a circus with their human cannonball act. Politically incorrect from the title cards on (look at the lips on those natives!), the film also serves as a reminder of Americans changing tastes in humor.
