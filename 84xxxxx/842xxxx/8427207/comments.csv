,keeganzo,2013-05-04T03:32Z,I sure wish you'd upload a smaller file for these programs...they're only 20 minutes long and I can't fit 190MB into my download schedule for JJ since I only get 45-50 kbps speeds half the day....the other half is 0...is there anyway you can up a small file for JJs...I'd love to watch these...thanx
