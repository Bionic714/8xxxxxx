I'm Moving On

Zoe's attempts at online dating hit a few
snags until Rose (guest star McKaley Miller)
and Max (guest star Nicholas Podany) take
matters into their own hands and play
matchmaker. Faced with yet another set back
with the Rammer Jammer, Lemon and Wade are
close to throwing in the towel. George tries
everything he can think of to prove to Tansy
guest star Mircea Monroe) that they belong
together, but she still has her doubts. Brick
and Shelby (guest star Laura Bell Bundy)
decide that they might have acted too rashly,
which forces them to make a difficult
decision about their future together.
Meanwhile, Lavon refuses AnnaBeth's (guest
star Kaitlyn Black) help in stopping the feud
with the competing town's Mayor, leaving her
to take a different tact.
