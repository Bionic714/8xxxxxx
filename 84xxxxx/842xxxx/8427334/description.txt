Warren Zevon Live at the Metro, Boston, 09-29-1982 -- FLAC

  A couple of sound issues, but a great set by Zevon in a small club in Boston. 

  It was recorded off the airwaves, about a 1.5 hour concert with 21 songs. A couple tracks are partial; I was going to cut them out of the torrent but you can cut them yourself if you want. Overall, pretty good quality sound and excellent material.
