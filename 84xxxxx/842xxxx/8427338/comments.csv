,abordeu,2013-05-01T21:06Z,"Hi Guys,

Zeno Clash 2 developer here reaching out to you. We expected the game to show up here so I wanted to drop a few lines and see if I can leave a message that hopefully sticks with some people. 

First of all I wanted to remind everyone that our studio, ACE Team, is a small independent company, and unlike bigger companies in our medium we are more vulnerable if our games don’t sell well. I was personally shocked when I read in more than one review that because we were making a sequel this implied that our company must be prosperous and that we’d grown up into a much larger studio.  At ACE Team we are only 15 very talented guys (look at the opening credits) and we’ve invested nearly two years dedicating countless hours and effort and resources in creating this game. We don’t have the luxury of making games that don’t sell.

Before saying anything further I thank you for your interest in our game. I know it’s strange to write this here, but I’m sure that if you reached this page it’s because you are looking for a game that’s different and that takes chances. But if you really want to see more games like this one, if you want us to keep on making games like this I urge you to pick up a paid copy. The people at our forums say they are having a great time with the game and we’ve developed a great relationship with them. We’re going to be giving a lot of post release support that goes beyond just bug fixes: new features, game modes and whatever we can think of. You’ll probably miss out on all that if you download the game on sites like these. So again, please buy the game and help support small, independent developers like us. We owe everything to the fans that are behind us and we’d love to count with you guys too.

Thanks for reading this!
Andres Bordeu
ACE Team"

I'll check the game out first. If it's good, Ill buy it. Torrents are pretty much full ""demo"" versions for gamers"

Actuall few recent games ( aliens colonial marines for example) show us that we cant trust any developers and trailers,gameplays etc so dont be surprised. I want first test game and then buy it, simple. Mak good demos so we dont need pirate versions. Btw i loved first zeno clash  (buyed) so if that part is simmilar i really like to pay for it."

,cjflex,2013-05-03T03:22Z,"I've never played the first Zeno Clash'' game, and have found out about Zeno Clash II  a few month prior to its launch, And i must say that i was bloody impressed, by the quality of the immersiveness, i don't have the most money, nor have i pirated any game for years now, but this game got attention, thus i was hesitant to purchase it via steam, with no prior experience, or notion of its existence. I did plan on downloading this game to feel what it was like, to test it as a demo, not to complete the game, but to get an hour or two in. Before i decide whether or not i'd purchase it. But after reading ''abordeu'' comment, i do not feel like even downloading the game to test it. I may just purchase it sometime in the near future and either regret or enjoy my purchase... I've pirated a lot of game in the past and ended up buying the retailed or digital version, i like it when i do purchase software, it feels right! So i'm one who isn't going to pirate this game, even though it was going to be for trial purposes!"
