,vkokkos79,2013-05-01T19:38Z,Is this only 3D or it's 2D also ???
,vkokkos79,2013-05-01T19:40Z,Is this only 3D version or it plays normal as 2D ?
,GMNavDisc2,2013-05-01T23:59Z,you'll most likely need to burn it to a bluray in order to watch in 3D.  Otherwise it will play the 2D version if you are streaming it

@vkokkos79  
Every 3D disc also plays in 2D.  Simply turn off the 3D option on your TV/monitor to watch it in 2D."
