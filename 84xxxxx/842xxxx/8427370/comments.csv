,Matinator10,2013-05-01T10:58Z,"@Rorossi:
Noob....this one is exactly the same as the one posted by stif. Simply download this one ONLY (or the one by stif), it will work. If it doesnt then none of them will work."
,scarecrowninja,2013-05-01T15:58Z,"I heard there where some problems with saving checkpoints in the other version, which was also annoying in Far Cry 3. Does this one suffer from the same problem?"

,Greenagoo,2013-05-20T10:43Z,"I copied the crack as usual, and when I start the game, I get the error ""The Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon service is not available.""
It let's me go to start a new game, but when I pick new game and it goes to start, the loading screen comes up for about 3 seconds and then it crashes. Not sure what's going on."
