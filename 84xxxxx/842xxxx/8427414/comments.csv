,CoreyJensen83,2013-05-02T20:23Z,Why .mkv????????????????????????????????????
,CoreyJensen83,2013-05-02T20:26Z,"What is so awesome about .mkv??? I'm a noob but .mkv's are huge and not compatible with shit. Only good for watching straight off my pc with VLC. What's the difference between mp4,avi, and mkv? "
