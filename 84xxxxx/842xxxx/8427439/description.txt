I don't know where this came from or where it was originally located. I got the torrent file from TorrentReactor, realized that there were very few people seeding and that it wasn't on TPB (unless it's under another name), so here you go.

Also, if anyone else downloaded this torrent previously and sees this, SEEEEEEEEED!!!!!!!! I WANT TO PLAY WITH XENIX AND I CANNOT DO THAT WHEN MY COMPUTERS ARE CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER AND TO ONE NON-UPLOADING PEER!!!!!!
