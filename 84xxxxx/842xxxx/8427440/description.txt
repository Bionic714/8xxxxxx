Back in the old days, amateur musicians would make home recordings using cassette four-tracks, creating physical copies and distributing the tapes by hand. "The old days," in this case, refers to 2001, when Seth Avett (best known as a member of the folk rock outfit the Avett Brothers) issued the album To Make the World Quiet under the moniker Timothy Seth Avett As Darling. At the time, there was no label involved, and the only people who received the album were those to whom the songwriter personally sold a copy. The following year, he released a second album, Killing the Headlamps, using similarly limited means.

This album was recorded in my apartment and downstairs in my dad's woodshop/garage. I mixed it in my kitchen. Thanks to my friends. I love you all. I hope you enjoy my story.
