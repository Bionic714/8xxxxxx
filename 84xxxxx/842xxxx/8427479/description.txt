And what a drive the mid-engined coupe turned out to be. For those that need more space, and have a few more dollars to spend, we have a review of the new Rapide S, a genuine sports car that just happens to have four-doors.
Ever fancied yourself as a racer, but just never found the time or money to compete? YouΓÇÖll find our feature on track day heroes to be of interest, but if the family is more of a priority, weΓÇÖve got reports on the go anywhere Colorado7 and the new, upmarket Santa Fe.
 
Also driven this month; a new Pulsar, a sub $30k hybrid, the fastest Volvo V40, a dressed-up Lexus limo, and a likeable mid-sized sedan from Hyundai plus we have stories on the revised Ducati Multistrada, a stunt ready KTM, a painstakingly restored Mustang Mach 1, a review of the new Highlands Motorsport Park and a pictorial of the V8 SupercarsΓÇÖ return to Pukekohe, plus much more.  .
