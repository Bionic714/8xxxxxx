Rock and roll musical, science fiction, comedy - I got 99 problems but a niche ain't one.

Twenty years ago, a virus killed off all of the males on Planet Pussycat. Faced with inevitable extinction, Queen Betty of Pussycat hatched a plan to save her loyal subjects - the remaining population, known as Bettys. After receiving Earth's television signals, four chosen Bettys traveled to Earth in search of men for procreation or dismemberment. Written, directed and music by Aaron Hendren, Psycho Bettys From Planet Pussycat stars Katy Houska, Hannah Kauffmann, Lauren Poole, Rachael Shapiro, Serouj Bingham, Gilbert Sanchez and Nate Warren. Psycho Bettys From Planet Pussycat is a rock and roll musical with its 'Dirty Pop' soundtrack available worldwide.

Egg Murders Productions, the gang behind Flicker, and The Faithful and the Foul, bring you this ulta low-budget, tongue in cheek, art house romp.
