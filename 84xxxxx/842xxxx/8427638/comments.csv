Zeno Clash 2 developer here reaching out to you. We expected the game to show up here so I wanted to drop a few lines and see if I can leave a message that hopefully sticks with some people. 

First of all I wanted to remind everyone that our studio, ACE Team, is a small independent company, and unlike bigger companies in our medium we are more vulnerable if our games don’t sell well. I was personally shocked when I read in more than one review that because we were making a sequel this implied that our company must be prosperous and that we’d grown up into a much larger studio.  At ACE Team we are only 15 very talented guys (look at the opening credits) and we’ve invested nearly two years dedicating countless hours and effort and resources in creating this game. We don’t have the luxury of making games that don’t sell.

Before saying anything further I thank you for your interest in our game. I know it’s strange to write this here, but I’m sure that if you reached this page it’s because you are looking for a game that’s different and that takes chances. But if you really want to see more games like this one, if you want us to keep on making games like this I urge you to pick up a paid copy. The people at our forums say they are having a great time with the game and we’ve developed a great relationship with them. We’re going to be giving a lot of post release support that goes beyond just bug fixes: new features, game modes and whatever we can think of. You’ll probably miss out on all that if you download the game on sites like these. So again, please buy the game and help support small, independent developers like us. We owe everything to the fans that are behind us and we’d love to count with you guys too.

Thanks for reading this!
