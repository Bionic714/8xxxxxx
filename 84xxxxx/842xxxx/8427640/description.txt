Embodying the culmination of two decades of collaboration between founding members Tara Nevins and Jeb Puryear, Donna The Buffalo's 2008 album builds on the band's signature sound - a bedrock of traditional mountain music infused with elements of Cajun, rock, folk, reggae and country. The album also includes the talents of such well-known guests as BΓÇÜla Fleck, Claire Lynch, David Hidalgo and Amy Helm.
