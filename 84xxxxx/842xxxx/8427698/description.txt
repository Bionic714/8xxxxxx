What's cool about it:
An original vision of the famous comic book artist and game developer Beno√Æt Sokal
An immersive story focused on character development
Enchanting locations with countless art nouveau and steampunk elements
Overview:
Kate Walker, a young ambitious lawyer from New York, is handed what seems to be a fairly straightforward assignment. Just a quick stopover to handle the sale of an old automaton factory hidden in the alpine valleys, then straight back home to New York. Little did she imagine, when embarking on this task, that her life would be turned upside down.

On her expedition across Europe, traveling from Western Europe to the far reaches of Eastern Russia, she encounters a host of incredible individuals and locations full of extraordinary machines and an amazing atmosphere. In her attempt to track down Hans, the genius inventor - the final key to unlock the secret of Syberia - she will traverse both land and time on a journey that will throw all that she values into question, while the deal she sets out to sign turns into a life-changing experience.
