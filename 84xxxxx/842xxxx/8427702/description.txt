The continuation of the immersive story that will touch your heart
Enchanting locations with countless art nouveau and steampunk elements
Overview:
Having searched Eastern and Western Europe for a missing heir, Kate Walker finally completed her long and arduous journey, obtaining the signature of Hans Voralberg and closing the automaton factory buyout. Mission accomplished? Perhaps, but not for her...

An unlikely pair, young Kate Walker and old, eccentric Hans Voralberg now set off on a journey together, in search of the last of the fabled Syberian mammoths at the heart of a long-forgotten universe. The surreal quest Hans began alone several years ago will come to a final close as he and Kate face obstacles far more dangerous than ever before, testing their courage and determination. Far and beyond, a mystical Syberia awaits their arrival.
