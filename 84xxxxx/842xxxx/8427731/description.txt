Red vs. Blue, often abbreviated as RvB, is a comic science fiction video web series created by Rooster Teeth Productions[2] and distributed through the Internet and on DVD. The story centers on two opposing teams of soldiers fighting a civil war in the middle of a desolate box canyon (Blood Gulch), in a parody of first-person shooter (FPS) games, military life, and science fiction films. Initially intended to be a short series of six to eight episodes, the project quickly and unexpectedly achieved significant popularity following its Internet premiere on April 1, 2003. The fifth season of the original Blood Gulch Chronicles series ended with episode 100, released on June 28, 2007. Three mini-seriesΓÇöOut of Mind, Recovery One, and Relocated ΓÇöand the three-part Recollection trilogy containing the full-length Reconstruction (2008), Recreation (2009) and Revelation (2010) series (Seasons 6-8) have extended the plot. The Project Freelancer saga began with Season 9 (2011) and follows two separate stories: a continuation to the Recollection trilogy and a prequel set before the events of The Blood Gulch Chronicles. The two stories are continued in two further mini-series - MIA and Where There's a Will, There's a Wall - and concluded in Season 10 (2012) which was the show's most recent season. Burnie Burns confirmed in What's Trending that the series will continue with Season 11, though further details and the date for the season premiere have not yet been announced.
