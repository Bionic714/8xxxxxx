Taken simply as an album, Dirty Radio is great. ItΓÇÖs fun and thoughtful. ItΓÇÖs familiar while still feeling fresh, and each song feels better than the last. As a debut album, itΓÇÖs even better. It shows promise, and when itΓÇÖs over, the listener is eager to cash in on said promise. Luckily, after Dirty Radio has come to a close, it doesnΓÇÖt feel as though Sallie Ford is one bit through with all sheΓÇÖs had to say. There is a wealth of potential in this songwriter, and it seems as though sheΓÇÖs just getting started.
