[V],psspss,2013-05-04T03:03Z,"just started to watch this paranormal group

man they must be the most sucky ghost investigators out there

I tihnk maybe ep5,6,7 are the better ones

they do these experiments but the spirit board is nothing without back up on other evidence

and the thing with mirror why didnt they have camera looking in to the mirror or was it.. I didnt see a ghost man she saw if thats the case"
[V],psspss,2013-05-04T08:30Z,"looks like S01E07 is actually the new gaiamtv episode 1 (non web series)
can see its been re-edited better
so atleast can see what the new format looks like
compared to their home grown efforts

I am not sure, will u be posting up more paranormal shows? u r the best for finding new stuff on the paranormal. that one with the english women u had a while back was pretty good to."
,guldkrona,2013-05-05T12:01Z,"This was almost painful to watch.
Unlike other ghost shows where they either dramatize the events (""A haunting"") or try to catch some evidence on camera (""Ghost hunters/Adventures""), here you have some ""mediums"" just claiming they can see and hear things, and a group of people sitting around a table chanting jibberish."
[V],psspss,2013-05-05T13:18Z,"wasnt that bad.. they did have some evps but some werent so clear more static crackle

ep5,6 and 7 were the better ones (ep7 is actually a leak of S02E01 from G-tv by looks as has same title and seems better edited)"
[V],psspss,2013-05-05T13:21Z,"as I said earler or was it on another torrent comment I have more paranormal groups to source and edit and share but it wont be for a few weeks.. just not enough data GINGER


however legend ET has added 3 seasons of RU paranormal grab those and also theres a new show which getting my haunted house

sadly my nas box died today and been busy fixing that.. looks like a new drive again.. 3tb lost
but have backups will take time to dup and find of course on other drives.. sigh"
