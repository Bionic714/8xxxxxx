Not watched my self but they look average investigators and the
video editing average as well. probably the new revamped gaiamtv
episodes will be heaps better


The R.I.P. Files is a paranormal reality show that takes you to some of the scariest
places on the planet.


Pre-2013 the episodes were released Freely on the internet as Webisodes.. its since been bought by Gaiamtv and re-edited for their subscription only
channel. Im not sure if the Season 1 episodes for
Gaiamtv are the same as the webisodes or not with
re-edits or new investigations/content? But this is
what I found and edited and converted for the
shows collection. since i have no id for gaiamtv

The R.I.P. Files features a different kind of group of paranormal investigators, based in Washington DC, who use their psychic abilities and their deep knowledge of metaphysical techniques to interact with the entities they encounter at haunted locations. The group calls itself Research and Investigation of the Paranormal (R.I.P.).

These investigators encourage the spirits to share their stories in their own words through amazing EVPs and other evidence that is bridging the gap between the worlds of science and spirituality. Not just another ghost show, The R.I.P. Files explores the issues of life and death that we all must face.

As the investigators learn and grow in their profession, making new discoveries that push the boundaries of paranormal research even further, they also find themselves compelled to examine the effects of their activities on their own lives, on the lives of those around them, and on the spirits themselves.
