because you couldn't make it past 3rd chapter or so in the original one, the crack and the keygen were both faulty..."
,Anroid869,2013-05-01T19:17Z,"I agree with ChiliNoMoreX, the copy protection on TW2+expansion was a pain in the ass.
I suggest people wait until the GOG-release shows up here on PB.
(TW1+2 were released a few days ago on Good old Games, those games are always stripped of the copy protection)"
,XxCmonxX,2013-05-02T05:56Z,can anyone please tell us if this working fine without any problems?? my connection is slow enough for me to think million time before downloading 4.36 gb

,forgetit,2013-05-02T14:21Z,"Installs and runs fine, includes expansion and updates. Apparently already cracked."
,kaintheravager,2013-05-04T07:39Z,I am getting a virus detection called suspicious.cloud.7.f - a heuristic virus when I run the setup. can anyone verify if this is a false positive of some kind? its labeling it a Trojan and I don't want to just go ahead with the install and get a virus.

,Crimsonshot,2013-05-04T19:49Z,"The language is in Russian by default; I can't read Russian, can anybody point me on the right path to change it to English?"
,Crimsonshot,2013-05-05T21:43Z,"Figured it out, when installing, click the ""components"" button when it asks where to install the game. There will be a selection for English under there."
,captainhook69,2013-05-08T01:25Z,"it seems like no matter how many times people are told about false positives,they cant grasp the fact that its a false positive,there's NO VIRUSES.
an up-loader with a pink skull IS TRUSTED,and would be insane to jeopardize his reputation"
