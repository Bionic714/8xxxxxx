"This was in 2003 when I did Thinking Man's Idiot at the Pleasance. It was on the final weekend and I went onstage after a three-day bender, literally getting no sleep.

"I'd got away with it the night before but I went right through to the following day. I was up there, meandering, babbling incoherently, I ran over, terrible.

"After I while I slowly but surely realised how bad I was so I started heckling myself, like "You fucking SUCK tonight!", tearing myself a new one. The audience just felt sorry for me, they felt awkward. People were saying "Come on, get it together," then after an hour-and-a-half they started cheering me and encouraging me "you can do this!" It was kinda sweet, very sweet of them. But who would put the boot in when they guy's berating himself onstage.

"Edinburgh being Edinburgh, there was worse shit around than that, though. Hal Cruttenden told me he was behind a guy in the queue who he thought was asking for his money back, Hal started saying "why are you wanting a refund that's just what Edinburgh's like, it's rock n roll", all that bullshit, and the guy said no he thought it was better than other people he'd seen.

"It was a mesmerising death, I've never seen anyone die like that in Edinburgh. Although I've seen previews where they've torn themselves to shreds: "Why have I taken this up, this is SHIT!"
