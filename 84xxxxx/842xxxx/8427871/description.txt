From chortle.co.uk:

Commentators are always looking for the big themes of an Edinburgh Fringe. Are comics talking about the Olympics, or the recession, or celebrity culture? But thatΓÇÖs to ignore the nature of comedians. The most recurring subject of this yearΓÇÖs festival seems to be googling yourself.
While on this very site, Brendon Burns found a comment that got his goat. ΓÇÿBurns does a convincing pose of a rock n roll comedian,ΓÇÖ said one punter, ΓÇÿbut it is the mere carapace to not very nutritious filling.ΓÇÖ
ItΓÇÖs not usually etiquette to engage with any online critics, but this comment clearly stung. Burns takes issue with the very fact heΓÇÖs trying to be a rock-and-roll comic. Once, maybe. But now heΓÇÖs over 40, married, with a teenage son and living in the countryside, where he owns a cosy pair of slippers. Hell, heΓÇÖs even got a routine on Masterchef, and why itΓÇÖs such a great show. Home Stretch Baby is a reference to the fact heΓÇÖs now where he wants to be in life, and the rest should be easy.
This, of course, is all delivered at ear-splitting volume and searing intensity, with a barrage of C-bombs, introduced with a pounding rock track. And thereΓÇÖs still a raging anger there: just mention his stepmum and see what spectacular pyrotechnics of profanities erupt from his embittered brain, itΓÇÖs beautiful in its viciousness. So, yes, with the ambiguity he likes to play with, there are still some rock-star sensibilities at play just as he is denying them.
Burns identifies with aging rockers like AC/DC, living a life of comfort becoming of their years, but still doing the business night after night. Their audiences, once terrifying, are now family men like Burns himself, seeking a sanitised reminder of the wild excess of their youth.
The main example of his increasing maturity, though, is the more varied tone of his show. Yes, thereΓÇÖs fury when he needs it, or a particularly graphic discussion of the insidious nature of online porn. Yet even this is more than just gratuitous filth, even if thatΓÇÖs what gets the laughs, as thereΓÇÖs a thought process behind it.
An important strand concerns his relationship with his dad, a bona fide engineering genius who made a fortune from his ideas, but an altogether different manner of man from his son. Burns Snr died earlier this year, but while the comic addresses this with wit and emotional honesty, this is not to be glibly dismissed as ΓÇÿdead dadΓÇÖ show.
Sprawling 25 minutes over the allocated hour ΓÇô but never feeling like its outstaying its welcome ΓÇô this lively show takes in his first, appalling, gig in 1990 to the challenges of performing to the aloof Dutch; the parochial arrogance of New York and even stromatolites (how hackΓÇª) The diverse topics all flow seamlessly together, and although BurnsΓÇÖ delivery can still be extreme, thatΓÇÖs far from always being the case. ThereΓÇÖs a thoughtfulness behind what heΓÇÖs saying, and a sometimes harsh poetry in the way that he says it. Plus just enough theatricality to give the stand-up a lift, without overwhelming it.
This is BurnsΓÇÖs best show since he won the big award five years ago ΓÇô thatΓÇÖs obvious despite an audience that was slow to warm to him tonight. It heΓÇÖs going to maintain this quality on his home stretch, the rest of us are in for a great ride.
