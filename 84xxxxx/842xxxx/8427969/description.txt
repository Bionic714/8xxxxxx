First biography paragraph from All Music (by William Ruhlmann):

The Royal Guardsmen from Ocala, FL -- Bill Balough (bass), John Burdette (drums), Chris Nunley (vocals), Tom Richards (guitar), Billy Taylor (organ), and Barry Winslow (vocals/guitar) -- enjoyed their brief reign of pop fame in 1966-1968 by recording a series of songs taking off from the Peanuts cartoon character Snoopy and his fantasy about aerial dog fighting with German World War I flying ace Baron Von Richthofen. The million-selling "Snoopy Vs. the Red Baron" was the first and most successful of these novelty records in the fall of 1966, and its follow-up, "The Return of the Red Baron," also made the Top 40.

Snoopy vs. the Red Baron
AMG Review by Bruce Eder

This is one weird and great rocking album -- as solid as any longplayer released by the Kingsmen, the Five Americans, or any other top garage band of the period. It opens with all-too-ubiquitous title tune, a number two hit and a million-seller, and the latter is interspersed with goofy rock novelty numbers such as "Peanut Butter" and "Alley - Oop", and the dance-rock standard "The Jolly Green Giant". But interspersed between them are surprisingly good renditions of oddites such as the Burt Bacharach/Hal David "Liberty Valance" (from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance) and Jimmy Driftwood's "The Battle of New Orleans". The latter sort of work in context with the title track, though it's a better song and the band treats it that way, and "Liberty Valance" is done with such sincerity that it could pass for a Ricky Nelson record of the era. And then come their crunchy covers of Bo Diddley's self-titled anthem and "Road Runner". And they work in one original, "Sweetmeats Slide", which is more of a goofy pop-novelty tune than anything else here, and really a throwaway -- it fits in less well with the rest of this album than anything else here, and is the capper for the sheer strangeness of this record. But when they're on target, which is most of the time, this band does well by the songs they've been handed and the opportunity they've been given -- this is no lost classic and no undiscovered garage-band treasure, just a fun rocking 30 minute diversion that's still worth a listen 40-some years later.

Snoopy and His Friends
AMG Review by Bruce Eder

In contrast to their debut album, which mixed straight rock & roll -- plus a few delightfully odd pop-related covers -- with their novelty hit, the Royal Guardsmen's third album is pretty much novelty themed all the way through. Not that they don't try to rock out on numbers like "The Return of the Red Baron," but on this album they never get away from the Snoopy/Red Baron theme until the second side. That's when you get to hear some mainstream pop-rock, on the Billy Taylor/Barry Winslow "I See Love," a fine piece of pop laced with blue-eyed soul. But even on the LP's second side, they can't quite get away from the Snoopy/Red Baron motif for very long, so that song is rather wasted here, as is another original, "So Right (To Be in Love)." What those two numbers are doing on this album is anyone's guess (though one imagines that the ex-group members would probably have a story to tell about it, if asked) -- they don't fit with anything else on the record, but they're the only part of this album that gives it anything value beyond being a pop culture curio, four decades on.
