First biography paragraph from All Music (by Richie Unterberger):

This Indiana group was still in high school when they were tapped by the Strangeloves production team of Feldman-Goldstein-Gottehrer as a vehicle for their material in 1965. Their first effort, "Hang on Sloopy," was a monster number one smash, built around a riff and chorus that ranks with "Louie Louie" and "La Bamba" as a garage band perennial with its compelling, elemental simplicity. Featuring the lead vocals and lead guitar of a young Rick Derringer, they went on to cut a lot of similar chunky, innocuous pop/rock over the next couple years with fair success. The "Hang on Sloopy" sound-alike "Fever" was their only other Top Ten entry, and the Ritchie Valens cover "C'Mon Let's Go" their only other Top 40 hit.

AMG Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine

The McCoys' first two albums, Hang on Sloopy and You Make Me Feel So Good, were combined on one CD by Immediate in the early '90s. Both records are pretty uneven -- any casual fan will be satisfied with a hits collection -- but they have their moments. However, they will only be of interest to hardcore fans, since there's too much filler for anyone who's not a devoted fan to wade through.

Hang on Sloopy
AMG Review by Steve Leggett

The McCoys' debut album in 1965 was less a unified collection than it was a classic single, the title tune "Hang on Sloopy," which featured the singing and guitar playing of a young Rick Derringer, surrounded by a lot of likeminded filler, although a couple of the tracks, most notably the relatively ambitious "Don't Worry Mother" and the striking "Sorrow," which sported a lovely melody, rose well above the generic feel of the rest of the album. That's still the case some 40-plus years later.
