Cosa Bella Frisca (Fresh Good Things) is a 2012 album by Dr.Drer & Crc Posse, sardinian rap-reggae band, 2009 winners of Rototom Sunsplash and of Liet, the international festival of modern bands who sing in a minority language. Rap and raggae merge here in great tunes with sardinian traditional music and with sounds from all over the world; lyrics face social themes and describe problems and contradictions, in a trip through space and time to describe contemporary Sardinia and to re-awaken the sardinian people consciousness of its history and actual problems. Languages are sardinian and sometimes italian; lyrics included.
