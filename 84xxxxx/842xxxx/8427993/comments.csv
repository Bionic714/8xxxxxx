,Serenifly,2013-05-01T13:06Z,"Thanks :)

I rip of the early WA and WP stuff would be great too. That stuff is impossible to find. There was a torrent of early WA in Real Media, but that's it."
,Serenifly,2013-05-01T13:09Z,Or if not the earliest shoots from the years 2003/04 then the ones with IDs in the 4000 and 5000 ranges. Lots of good ones there.
,BTMas2k,2013-05-01T18:25Z,merzedes for president!
,BTMas2k,2013-05-01T18:27Z,"Yeah, most of the EARLY early WA/WP stuff was crap, IMO... you are right though; lots of good stuff starting about 3-4000 and onwards that is impossible to find any more.  Used to be able to type virtually any number in to a site like filestube and get tons of results... no more.  "

,Serenifly,2013-05-04T20:38Z,"There is also some weird stuff going in early Kink shoots. For example it took them a while to make WA and WP truly all-girl. So you sometimes get shoots that contain cock. Like this:

Same with FM. They didn't put much if any effort into hiding the guys holding the machines in the beginning.

Or even blowjobs on FM:
