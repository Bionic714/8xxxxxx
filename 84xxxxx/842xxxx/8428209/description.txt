"I'm here for other children. I'm here because I care. I'm here because children everywhere are suffering, and because 40,000 people die each day from hunger. I'm here because those people are mostly children. We have got to understand that the poor are all around us, and we're ignoring them. We have got to understand that these deaths are preventable! We have got to understand that people in 3rd world countries think, and care, and smile, and cry, just like us. We have got to understand that they are us, we are them. My dream is to stop hunger by the year 2000. My dream is to give the poor a chance. My dream is to save the 40,000 people who die each day. My dream can, and will come true, when we all look into the future, and see the light that shines there." ~ Rachel Corrie, 5th grade speech, murdered at 23 by military-armoured Caterpillar bulldozer drivers, while protecting the house of a Palestinian doctor from demolition.

"No amount of reading, attendance at conferences, documentary viewing, and word of mouth could have prepared me for the reality of situation here. You just can't imagine it, unless you see it. This is not at all what I asked for, when I came into this world. This is not at all what the people here asked for when they came into this world. This is not the world you and dad wanted me to come into, when you decided to have me. This has to stop. I think it is a good idea for us all to drop everything, and devote our lives to making this stop." ~ Rachel Corrie's final thoughts, (emailed to her mother prior to her death)

The DVD *is* being seeded, despite what the counter says.
To all good people who seed the DVDs they like, thank you very much!
