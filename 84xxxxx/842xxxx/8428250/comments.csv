,supermario5029,2013-05-01T14:39Z,"i promise i will seed,the game is small after all,SO WHY THE FOOGE NOT?"
,kratosmaster,2013-05-01T15:02Z,there's only about 25% available.  could the uploader please reseed?
,dmmyf,2013-05-01T15:31Z,"180MB Down
2.19GB Up so far.

Please reseed."
,goingmad1,2013-05-01T15:44Z,So many hit and runs... Speed is horrendous. Never got such bad speed in any torrent. But will wait and then seed myself for some time. 
,thegronk,2013-05-01T16:22Z,"Its not hit and runs, it's not fully seeded, I got about 600kb/s up until 250 mb or so, then it hit 7kb/s.."
,dmmyf,2013-05-01T16:36Z,"Don't think they're hit and runs man.

I grabbed it almost as soon as it came up and I've still only got 60% but uploaded 5 gigs."

,StagedPotato,2013-05-01T20:13Z,"Game crashes when I try to start it up. 

Anyone know why? "
,StagedPotato,2013-05-01T20:16Z,"Game crashes when I start it up, anyone got a fix? "
,StagedPotato,2013-05-01T20:21Z,Did my comment get deleted? 
,gdfsgdfg,2013-05-01T22:26Z,"You probably missing some net framerwork or visual c++ redists from your windows. Oh and your comment not showing is a bug from tpb.

Anyway thanks for the release phil bell is such an ass he deserves all the pirated downloads."
,adenin00,2013-05-02T01:24Z,"The game crashes at launch, i'm getting this message for the first time,""your video card is not able to run fez''"
,Ignusdej,2013-05-02T01:34Z,"Please, for fucks sake, don't buy this game! Pirate it, but don't spend money on it. Phil Fish, this asshole of developer doesn't deserve a single penny."
,Nill427,2013-05-02T02:40Z,"I bought this game. Fish is an ass but he went through a lot of shit to get FEZ done.
Does he have a superiority complex? Of course!
Is that any reason not to support him as a developer? Fuck no but if you're so goddamned butt-hurt about his opinions, maybe it's YOU who shouldn't play it.
If hes got talent, support it. If you're just being a little bitch, cut it out."
,mesomeso,2013-05-02T02:59Z,"This is v1.00 and has major bugs, don't waste your time with this

Wait a few days until someone adds an updated, fixed version. This is a horrible port and currently is not worth your time

I'm glad I checked it out before buying"
,Leader13,2013-05-02T03:15Z,"So I'm guessing no one knows how to fix the random crash at startup?
I just start the game, it acts like it's loading and then crashes a few seconds later... ;_;"
,Poseidon_M_Hernandez,2013-05-02T06:46Z,Ignusdej: why are you downloading and playing his game if you hate him so much. Why don't you fucking go back to your crystal pedestal and stop bitching at others just because they are human and make mistakes (you piece of shit).
,AtomBlast,2013-05-02T12:06Z,"I get a lot of framerate drops, it's going 60 fps for 10 seconds and drops to 20 for one second all the time. It's really annoying."
,surfboy192,2013-05-03T04:09Z,"This looks like such a fun game, but it crashes every time. ;_;"
,08191980,2013-05-03T04:38Z,"A few people are complaining about the game crashing, but what's actually happening is you're hitting the button that's mapped to (B) on the Xbox 360 controller (this game was ported from Xbox 360). If you hit that button on your gamepad instead of the button mapped to (A), the game flickers and quits without asking...looking like it crashed. If you (A) the game continues instead of quitting."
,Trismogestos,2013-05-03T08:38Z,Version 1.03 is out on GOG! Can someone upload it?
,Trismogestos,2013-05-03T08:44Z,Version 1.03 is out on GOG! Can someone upload it?

,Mahaloth,2013-05-04T19:41Z,"I get the same error as Ehsan_danger4 and I have updated to 1.03. No fix there. 

Anyone know how to fix this?"
,ffhighwind,2013-05-06T00:00Z,"Game is consistently crashing on a certain area for me, but I can probably still beat it. Game lags a bit in the middle of some levels. Minor sound issues at times, but barely noticeable."
,YesYesYesYesYes,2013-05-06T13:42Z,"If your game crashes at start up, run exe as administrator - worked for me. Good luck!"
