Grabben i graven bredvid [2002] (Swedish film)

Desirée, a modern librarian with urban friends and interests is visiting her
late husband's grave when she meets Benny, a simple farmer. After his mother's
death Benny lives alone on the run-down farm, desperately seeking a woman to
take care of him. In spite of their differences the two have the dream of
finding that special someone in common, and fall passionately in love. Benny
wants Desirée to move in with him and start a family as soon as possible. But
being a farmer's wife is not something she is very enthusiastic about. Just
presenting Benny as her boyfriend proves to be an embarrassing experience. And
when she gets a tempting job offer in Stockholm she has to consider her
priorities carefully.
