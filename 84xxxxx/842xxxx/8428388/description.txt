SHAUN MICALLEF is BACK and he's MADDER than HELL. We really should have changed the name but it'd cost us a FORTUNE in letterheads and weΓÇÖd have to change the show GRAPHICS which also runs into MONEY. Anyway, he's back FOR A SECOND SERIES - that's the POINT. And THIS TIME he KNOWS what he's DOING (slightly).
