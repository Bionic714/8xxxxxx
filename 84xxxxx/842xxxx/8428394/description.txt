Mutt is right. Cory Branan is no purebred. He boasts no pedigree, no papers. Instead, heΓÇÖs a stray who wanders in off the street, of mixed breed: Is he another confessional singer/songwriter? An alt-country straggler? A frat-rock folk-hero? A Memphis misfit? A Southern voice descended more from Clyde Edgerton and Larry Brown than from Ronnie Van Zandt? Truth is, heΓÇÖs a bit of everything, hanging around on the edges of various genres and taking what he needs from each. To date, heΓÇÖs had a strange career: Rolling Stone thought enough of his witty 2002 debut, The Hell You Say, to devote a full-page spread to a beefcake shot of the Memphian, shirt unbuttoned just so. His follow-up took four years; his third album, six.

But heΓÇÖs worth the wait. Few songwriters sum up the contradictions of beery romanceΓÇöof bad men drinking in barrooms, of heartbreakers darkening your doorΓÇöwith quite as much grit, wit and compassion as Branan, who can turn a phrase on a dime. ΓÇ£Day-drinking and dreaming of you, I let the ashtray some my last cigarette,ΓÇ¥ he sings on opener ΓÇ£The Corner,ΓÇ¥ which sums up his ethos perfectly. ΓÇ£Darken My DoorΓÇ¥ bests anything Ryan Adams has written since Heartbreaker, and ΓÇ£Yesterday (Circa Summer 80 SomethinΓÇÖ)ΓÇ¥ is a bittersweet teenage reverie that rewrites MellencampΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Jack and DianeΓÇ¥ into your new summer jam: ΓÇ£You were a walking want ad, you had summer on your side,ΓÇ¥ he leers. ΓÇ£You were dancing barefoot on the picnic table and dammit girl truly goddamit girl truly goddamit girl truly goddam!ΓÇ¥

BrananΓÇÖs unruly cowlick of a voice may be the perfect vehicle for his lusty lyrics, capable of redeeming even some of his flatter sentiments (IΓÇÖm thinking ΓÇ£she lines my coat with kitesΓÇ¥ on ΓÇ£KarenΓÇÖs Song,ΓÇ¥ which shouldnΓÇÖt work but somehow does). Being a musical mutt means taking risks, which Branan does with glee. Mutt is, appropriately, all over the damn place: ΓÇ£The FreefallΓÇ¥ has a dusty southwestern vibe reminiscent of Calexico, ΓÇ£BadmanΓÇ¥ SpringsteenΓÇÖs flair for drama, ΓÇ£SurvivorΓÇÖs BluesΓÇ¥ the momentum of a drunk escapade in a stolen car.

Occasionally, BrananΓÇÖs range can be a bit dizzying, resulting in some jarring transitions that trip up the middle third of Mutt. With its delicately plucked strings and crooner melodies, ΓÇ£Lil HeartbreakerΓÇ¥ leads directly into the gypsy ballad ΓÇ£Snowman,ΓÇ¥ which sounds like a Tom Waits castoff. TheyΓÇÖre two of the weakest tracks here, and their pairing is all the more self-conscious and showy from an artist who otherwise sounds like he has absolutely nothing to prove. Mutt is a mess of an album, but I mean that in the best way possible.
