,radiobbc,2013-05-01T15:24Z,"A conversation with my Dad, Rick Thompson.

Rick is a journalist who worked for the BBC for about 30 years. He now runs his own media training company, called T-Media. He's also been my Dad for 35 years. In my family we consider him to be like Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. His knowledge is pretty encyclopedic. If I have a question, he is usually able to give quite an extended answer to it, although sometimes the facts can be a little bit unreliable. That's why I've started to call him ""Rickipedia""."
