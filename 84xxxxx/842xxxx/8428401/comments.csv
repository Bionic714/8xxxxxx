,elwood801,2013-05-02T02:28Z,"funny: somebody should inform wilco, course there is no volume 2 from the developers side^^"
,maddog7777,2013-05-02T14:26Z,"Not a big fan of their planes as most of their planes were failures to begin with, but not sure what this is because there is no VOL2 Unless you have a copy of something not published or announced yet!"
,adi14,2013-05-02T14:45Z,"Yeah you're wright. But there wa a Regional Jet from Wilco before which is also available here. But thats the new Version.. Here the link:

,elwood801,2013-05-02T23:24Z,"nope, its not new: same version (converted from fs9) will be sold since more than 5 years now. SP2.2 is also older than 3 years and there is now Volume 2"
,adi14,2013-05-03T21:15Z,"grfam: try this one, for me it works very well

LGAVVFV550VL328

If not, please leave a comment, and I will upload the full addon.(FSX and Fs9)"
,adi14,2013-05-03T22:13Z,"   D'ont blame me up here. I have two Regional Jets installed. The first version was built in 2003, so quite  old.. And the model and Vc isn't very good as well. 
That is now v2 developed from feelthere.
In my Sim its called: ERJ-135LR v2   so everything is alright guys.."
,adi14,2013-05-03T22:18Z,"Hey d'ont blame me up. I have two versions installed in my sim. The first one was developted by wilco in 2003..Annoying Vc and model...

The Volume2 was created by feelthere and is really hard to find on the web. In my Sim it shows up as:
ERJ-145LR v2 so everything is correct here
greetings"
,NazCYPHER32,2013-05-03T23:16Z,"Don't get confused..this is Wilco Regional Jet V2 which include 135LR,145LR and 145XR this is the last and latest (2010) release and not to be confused with E-Jet v2,E-Jet v2 have 175LR,175SU and 195LR....You won't See Wilco Regional Jet V2 on wilco site because they've taken down the v1,the v1 is only for fs9,with port over to fsx update to v1.2.6 and releasing the v2 as Wilco Regional Jet ...what adi14 uploaded here is the same v2 released on WOS&WD 3 years ago,this version is correct v2,v2 is not portable fs9,but FT build it for both sim,both have 2 installer for fs9 and fsx,the one inside this is only fs9 version =)"
,NazCYPHER32,2013-05-03T23:30Z,"hQQp://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5701848/ 

here is for both fsx and fs9 installer..
replace QQ with ""tt"" without quote"
,maddog7777,2013-05-04T03:52Z,"@adi14 this serial is already blacklisted. It will install the main addon, but not the update for FlyTampa Athens. Just to let you know and for @grfm not to waste your time with this number because it will not work for the update. He was looking for a serial that will allow him to run the v1.1 update."
,Capt.Jambo,2013-05-05T21:57Z,"This is for FS9.

Thanx anyway"
,elwood801,2013-05-08T12:07Z,"@NazCYPHER32: i say again: there is no Volume 2 ! By the way: if it is the ERJ145, than its called ""Embraer Regional Jets"" : http://www.wilcopub.com/simulator-add-on/embraer-regional-jets.html

The only Version 2 sold from Wilco is ""E-Jets v2"" and this is not the ERJ145, its 175 and 195."
,NazCYPHER32,2013-05-14T22:58Z,"@elwood801  yup,thats its,I'm not saying there is Volume 2,its version 2...as I said,you won't see Regional Jet with the ""v2"" title in wilco site..they replaced the old fs9 model which they offered fs9-to-fsx port over 6-7 years ago with this 2010 version 2 release,a new model with proper fsx built and fs9 built and adding 135LR and 145XR ...they don't name v2 coz they don't want new customer confused with older version and ensure they get the new model a.k.a v2 here with the new proper model for fsx with many improvements and not the v1 port over,you won't see old v1 in their site anymore since the date this was released.."
,adi14,2013-05-15T21:25Z,"NazCYPHER32 if fully right. There WAS a Version 1 BEFORE, this is the V2 from Feelthere"
,Lonewolfee1,2013-05-25T08:01Z,Does anyone know where I can get the Just Flight Avro Vulcan for FS2004?  Any help would be appreciated.
