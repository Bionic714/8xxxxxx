Songwriter Anais Mitchell (Hadestown, Young Man in America) teams up with songwriter/instrumentalist Jefferson Hamer (Great American Taxi, the Murphy Beds) to co-arrange a series of English and Scottish ballads from the Francis James Child collection. The album, Child Ballads, was recorded in Nashville with legendary producer/engineer Gary Paczosa (Alison Krauss, Dolly Parton). These are traditional ballads that have been carefully re-imagined to embrace an American sensibility as well as a deep respect for the heritage of the tradition.
