The Cove
In his film debut The Cove, award-winning director/photographer Louie Psihoyos highlights the gruesome, annual slaughter of about 2,300 dolphins in a National Park at Taiji, Wakayama, in Japan. Backed up with hard facts, interviews and undercover evidence the documentary follows the atonement of "Flipper" trainer Ric O'Barry as he continues on his dangerous quest to end the annual killing of dolphins trapped in a secret cove. Within this film, uncomfortable footage highlights the length of deception the authorities are prepared to go to in order to hide the abuse of these animals. While the entire town promotes their love of cetaceans, attracting tourists from all over the world, activities at the aggressively guarded cove indicate a far less loving regard for the animals. We see Japanese marine scientists select a few dolphins destined for theme parks across the world. In graphic, spine chilling footage we see the fate of the remaining few hundred dolphins. These are brutally, inhumanely bludgeoned to death before being sold off as meat. Evidence of rampant corruption is unleashed to the Japanese public as the illegal toxicity levels of mercury found in the dolphin meat is exposed.
Director Louie Psihoyos justifies his need for the secret, undercover filming as his attempts to openly collect footage of the cove are met with threats of violence from the local fishermen and intimidation by the Japanese authorities.
DVD Release Date: 5 April 2011
