Today skateboarding is omnipresent.
Take a walk down any street in any town, and you are destined to see
someone riding a skateboard.

Well, it wasn't always like that. In the early '80s, skateboarding was
fading away until Stacy Peralta brought a profoundly talented group of
outsiders together and dubbed them the Bones Brigade.

This documentary chronicles their epic rise, using awesome archival footage
and moving first-person accounts from Brigade members Steve Caballero,
Tommy Guerrero, Tony Hawk, Mike McGill, Lance Mountain, and Rodney Mullen,
among others.

Through passion, drive, creativity, and a surprising sense of teamwork,
they revitalized the sport and influenced generations to come.

BONES BRIGADE will blow the minds of anyone who grew up emulating these guys,
but it also resonates for anyone who ever found a family or a purpose in an
unexpected place.
