,porrigtporrigt,2013-05-02T21:12Z,"Awesome dude, so is there anything spec i need to do to be able to get all the mods working ingame or are they all already installed so i just install the game and play my way to happiness?"
,egovir32,2013-05-02T21:50Z,"@porrigtporrigt:
just install it, and follow the  easy instructions (included)"
,Havendell,2013-05-04T19:45Z,Seed please! I'm getting about .8kB/s!
,coca12345678910,2013-05-05T14:34Z,"Hey man, thanks for this torrent, it's really working!
I have 1 question, what if i want put polish subtiles to this game, will i have problems with it :(?"
,egovir32,2013-05-05T17:10Z,"@coca12345678910:
i'm not sure about subtitles, since i never did use those.
but, if i had to guess, i don't think it might be a big problem."
,coca12345678910,2013-05-07T22:32Z,Seed 5 kb/s ....
,largemeat,2013-05-14T01:13Z,"Quick question: any known compatibility issues with the ""A Quest for Heaven"" mods?  Or ""A Devil's Wish""?

Looks *very* similar to what I'm running, based loosely on Gopher's ""Let's Play Fallout 3"" mod list from his latest FO3 series of vids.  Though I do have Dragbody's armor pack and several of Corehound's armor/weapon replacers for the different factions (BoS, Outcasts, Rivet City, raiders, etc). 

Been having some nagging crash-to-desktop issues though. Mostly to do whenever Talon Company shows up."
,woxer111,2013-06-01T14:26Z,"This torrent really confuses me. In the Fallout 3 launcher it says that my graphics card is 7900 GS(even tho it's a GTX 560 Ti 448), and when I start up the game with NMM(all mods active) it's really laggy and crashes when i choose the alt. starting place."
