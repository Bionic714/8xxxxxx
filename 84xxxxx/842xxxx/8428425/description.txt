Fallout 3: Ultimate Modification Pack

A custom made repack of the original Fallout 3 with most of the popular mods combined, including HD textures.

This will bring completely new experience and challenge to the game compared to the original Fallout 3.

However i did manage to stabilize the game, so it will not crash at all on my PC, this build is still purely experimental,
and may bring you a lot of pain in the lower part of your spine, depending on the hardware you have.

Note that you can download and install all of those mods for yourself by visiting fallout3.nexusmods.com, and if you
already have that experience, this repack is probably not for you.

If you still want to try it out, be sure to read the proper launch instruction included with the game.
