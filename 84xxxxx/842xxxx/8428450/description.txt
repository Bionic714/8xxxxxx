Kindle Traffic Sniper: Boost Up Your Conversion Rate & Make Bank with Amazon Kindle
English | 2013 | PDF | eLearning | 4MB

Kindle Traffic Sniper reveals a method Kindle authors can use to get stats from their Amazon sales pages. As you may know, Amazon does not normally make this information available to authors, so you can only evaluate the performance of your sales page by copies of your book sold. That's fine as far as it goes, but it doesn't give you any indication of the proportion of visitors who end up buying.

By using Joel's method to obtain stats about visitor numbers (and where they come from) you can gauge much better how effective your page is at persuading people to buy, as well as monitoring far more accurately the effects of advertising, KDP Select promotions, title and description changes, new cover images, and so on.

Kindle Traffic Sniper comes in the form of a 29-page PDF, illustrated with screen captures. It's not the best-written guide I've ever seen, but then again English is not Joel's first language. It's all stll perfectly comprehensible, though.
