,Lost_Leaf,2013-05-01T16:10Z,"Hahaha. You've started a tradition, Kodomo. It's going to be unlucky if you start to remember. 

And thanks. I'll stop seeding on the episode you're deleting and re-seed on your updated version. "
,kenno2008,2013-05-01T16:17Z,"New episodes of Fate/Zero and Accel World air on Friday nights on Neon Alley unless they specify otherwise. How fast I get them out depends how bad the first airing is screwed up that night for shows, and if so have to wait till the next rebroadcast which could be hours or days from the original night."
,kodomo_scales,2013-05-01T16:28Z,"so kenno2008, are you going to be releasing these as dvd rips or... can you get me atleast the audio before the weekend for new ones? im trying to figure out what you were trying to say exactly, because i dont see you having anything from Neon Alley. might i know you on another /nick?"
,kodomo_scales,2013-05-01T16:40Z,"Kenno, do i know you by another name? are you going to release these as dvdrips?  can you get me the webrips before the weekend? because thats when i can get em. im just not exactly sure what you are trying to say because i dont see any neon alley on your list or anything. the only thing i can guess is that weve talked before on another name or somthing"
,cpt.shinyside,2013-05-02T00:46Z,Haha thanks again Kodomo! You are awesome. =) Never thought i'd be seeing this stuff so fast out here in Australia.
,kodomo_scales,2013-05-02T02:29Z,mm yes cpt. shinyside.  theres something almost magical about bluray rips that are released before tv streams. lol. youre very welcome again :p
,kodomo_scales,2013-05-02T02:52Z,"mehhh, i just put the stuff together.;)"
,kenno2008,2013-05-02T07:51Z,"My bad the other comment was really meant for the torrent to reply to someone asking when new episodes air, but posted it here since you commented you were deleting that file. Unfortunately the English version is from the Neon Alley stream for the time being until Aniplex announces a dvd and or blu-ray version with the dub. Sadly as of right now Only Madman has a license for the dub dvd/blu-ray version. I'm releasing them as they air on tv on Nyaa, but from the blu-ray version as the dvd doesn't contain the directors cuts for the episodes like what they are airing on Neon. No I can not get you the audio before Friday nights as that is the first airing of new episodes as long as they actually air the day they are suppose to since some times they post the weekend schedule last min on their home page. Episode two was late posting as there were several blackouts during the weekend so got it done when I could get power back. If there are delays will try to keep my torrents updated with a status."
