OK , im sure i dont have to tell you what this is, but im going to be removing the first fate zero torrent i added and im going to re do it with dual AAC instead of japanese FLAC. thats how its going to be from now on so you may want to re grab the other one im going to upload next unless it doesnt matter to you.  
  1080p video i got from RUELL, UTW subs and the english audio is all thanks to Lupin THE Nerd.

     1080p dual audio accel world is coming up next along with the first dual audio batch of MONSTER.  im still taking requests.  Please help seed if you can so i can continue to work fast and bring you goodies.  ENJOY :]
