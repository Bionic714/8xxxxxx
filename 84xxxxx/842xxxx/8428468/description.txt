Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences(Third Edition)
Mary L. Boas (Author)


Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences is a textbook by mathematician Mary L. Boas intended to develop skills in mathematical problem solving needed for junior to senior-graduate courses in engineering, physics, and chemistry. The book provides a comprehensive survey of analytic techniques and provides careful statements of important theorems while omitting most detailed proofs. Each section contains a large number of problems, with selected answers. Numerical computational approaches using computers are outside the scope of the book.
The book, now in its third edition, is still widely used in university classrooms and is frequently cited in other textbooks and scientific papers.
