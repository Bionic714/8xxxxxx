Thanks again :)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T13:47Z,"Noitanracni39, i don't understand why you can't find anything? use the search box at the top of this page and type in witch doctor. all 6 issues of mal practice are near the top of the results."
,Noitanracni39,2013-05-17T22:39Z,"Hey dude thanks!! It's because I was just typing the keywords ""witch doctor malpractice"", that's why I was only getting the first two issues.. Thanks again :D"
