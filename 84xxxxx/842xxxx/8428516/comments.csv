,oneneo,2013-05-01T19:04Z,"Is the game crashing for anyone else? I'm trying to solve a block puzzle early in the game, and the game keeps crashing to my desktop after only a minute or two."

,babylink9,2013-05-01T20:12Z,"I seeded as far as bitcomet goes (2 hours), but the game crashes on the loading screen every time I open it. Was there an instruction I missed?"
,dmmyf,2013-05-01T23:15Z,"Guys the crashing at the tetris block puzzle is a known bug and has been patched in the Steam version of the game.


Any chance of an update??

Cheers."
[V],HeroMaster,2013-05-02T05:24Z,"@ALL The Crash is the part of the game, its not a real crash, its fake, its makes the crash itself as its according to the gameplay."
,dmmyf,2013-05-02T11:45Z,"No man this isn't the crash you get when you get the FEZ.

When you get to an area with blocks arranged in the shapes of tetris pieces the game hangs and you need to kill the process in task manager.

They have already announced a patch.

I've completed the game (currently at ~120% completion; yes, it's over 100%, I heard people saying >200%) with this release (ver. 1) and will buy it when I get some money."
,specialvictim,2013-05-17T03:51Z,"Fez was crashing constantly on start up for me, but after applying the update 1.06a from Ghostnet it finally works! However the game runs extremely choppy unless i'm inside a house or something. My computer should be more than adequate to run it smoothly. Advice anybody?
