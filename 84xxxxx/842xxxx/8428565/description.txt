Sodom is a German thrash metal trio from Gelsenkirchen, formed in 1981.

Along with the bands Kreator and Destruction, Sodom is considered one of the "big three" of Teutonic thrash metal. While all three bands created a sound that would influence death metal, Sodom's music style would greatly influence many late-1980s and early-1990s black metal bands, among others.
