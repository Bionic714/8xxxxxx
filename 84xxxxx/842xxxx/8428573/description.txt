A vivid drama that documents the notorious
"Moors murderers", Ian Brady and Myra Hindley.

From 1963 to 1965, Ian Brady and Myra Hindley
embarked on a vicious crime spree that would
go haunt England for decades to come. Over the
course of those two dark years, Brady and
Hindley abducted two teenagers and three young
children, sexually assaulting each before
brutally ending their lives and disposing of
the bodies in shallow graves across Manchester's
dreary Saddleworth Moor. Forty years after the
court case that brought Brady and Hindley to justice.

Powerful and thought-provoking drama based on one of the
most shocking crimes of the 20th century. This is the
chilling story of child killers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley
and how they were finally brought to justice. Convicted of
the torture and killing of five youngsters, the Moors
Murderers remain two of the most hated figures in Britain.

See No Evil reveals the untold story and is based on two
years of intensive research and interviews with detectives
and the key trial witness. It is produced in consultation
with the murdered childrenâ™s relatives.
