,nyzilleztndn,2013-05-11T00:04Z,"boys, what we have here is simple 30. my indian mind is telling me what you guys are thinking is good, 50 people 4 bucks. i personally think that is going to be hard. WHO HAS SIMPLE30? nd if possible they should at least write in text what the challege is every day, or somehow try to downloda it then upload, spread the word."

I can see the comments to the simple 30 day 1 challenge. I am using NoRedirect, but I can't see the video. Can anyone of you see the video? Has anyone of you with computer skills an idea how to make them visible?
Cheers."
,btsobo,2013-05-13T18:42Z,"@Charlie_Firpo I have got the same problem. Can see the comments and that calendar, but I can't see the videos."
,Charlie_Firpo,2013-05-13T19:16Z,"@btsobo
Keep in mind, but the videos could also be on a different part of the site."
,btsobo,2013-05-13T21:53Z,"@Charlie_Firpo I have written a msg on some forum, looking for help from computer scientists"
