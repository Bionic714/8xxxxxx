,Darkeangelus,2013-05-01T19:30Z,"Thanks for the download. It is appreciated- really. Take note to those downloaders who aren't aware of it, this series will be CANCELLED as of Issue #262. Now, as a personal rule, I would download an issue here but also pay Marvel for a digital copy just in the hopes that this great series wouldn't suffer in sales. At least I know I made the effort. How about the rest of you?"
,Darkeangelus,2013-05-01T19:35Z,"Many thanks for the download- It's really appreciated. As a personal rule, I would download the issue but would also pay Marvel for the digital copy in hopes that sales wouldn't suffer from y'know, what we're all doing here. As of issue 262, X-Factor is CANCELLED. Ah well, at least I know my conscience is clear..."
,katytron,2013-05-01T21:02Z,"Darkeangelus, just to clarify. X-Factor is wrapping up because its writer, Peter David, says he feels he is done with the story. It has nothing to do with sales. I'm going to miss the hell out of X-Factor. I never would have set foot in a comic shop if I hadn't read this book."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T21:32Z,"its sales have been very low since #250, however it's true that PAD seems to be quite satisfied and ready to move on. he said he has a new project but couldn't say what it is yet."
,Darkeangelus,2013-05-01T22:18Z,"So sorry for the double post. I hit ""Hide"" when I wrote the second, but it didn't take. I apologize for my statement appearing like some sort of rant. It wasn't intended to be that at all. In PADs words here: http://marvel.com/videos/watch/2723/c2e2_2013_peter_david

When asked by his daughter why the series was cancelled he told her: ""Sales have been good but not fantastic."" You can't honestly say that what we're doing here has HELPED that situation. 404 Seeders (including me)- How many have ponied up $2.99 to Marvel in thanks for such a wonderful comic? Just saying..."
,katytron,2013-05-01T22:19Z,"Yeah I saw that. In the meantime I'm reading his 90s X-Factor and have plans to read his Incredible Hulk run, love me that Marvel Unlimited sub ^_^"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-01T23:56Z,"you're in for a huge treat on the incredible hulk, it was outstanding.

i download stuff i haven't tried, i buy stuff i really like whenever i can.

what other books are you reading nowadays, Darkeangelus, if you don't mind me asking? (and don't worry about the comment submission button, it's been screwed up all day!)"
,katytron,2013-05-02T10:46Z,"my ""must buys"" are fearless defenders, journey into mystery, red she hulk, captain marvel, and avengers assemble. the new brian wood x-men will be going on the list once it starts, too. i just bought the second coming x-factor trade this afternoon because the x-factor nation-x oneshot is everything i want in a comic about the mutants."
,katytron,2013-05-02T12:49Z,"sorry, i know that your question was for darkeangelus. got carried away :> "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-02T16:37Z,"no worries, it was for anyone.

hey i am glad that you (a) became a comics reader thanks to PAD/x-factor and (b) are supporting the female-protagonist marvel books. they need support, the whole industry is too homogenized.

if you get bored, check out the movement #1 -- i uploaded it here yesterday -- you might enjoy it. it is a dc comic but doesn't require you to know or like anything about dc.

if you're really, really looking for something else to try, you might love spider-girl. it was my very favorite book for years.

sorry if you know about 1 or both of those, i'm just going from a ""if you don't know..."" approach. no insult intended.  :-)"
,katytron,2013-05-03T12:34Z,"the movement sounds interesting, will check it out. i have to admit my dc knowledge is very lacking, although i'm reading some old jla/jli at the moment at the recommendation of a few of my mates. haven't heard much about spider-girl, though? i have vague recollections of a...wait, no, i just looked it up and i was thinking of mattie franklin who ran around as spider-woman for a while. thnx for the recs!"
,cholizo,2013-05-07T10:27Z,"Sales for X-Factor have never been great, it's been consistently in Marvel's bottom 25% for years.  They keep it around because PAD tells a fantastic story for his hardcore fans, while they have canceled books that have sold much higher.  "
,cholizo,2013-05-07T10:29Z,"Forgot to mention that while I get my digital backup copy here, I have every issue of X-Factor since the Madrox mini series in print in a long box in the basement and will continue to purchase every issue until its end."
