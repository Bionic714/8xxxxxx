This is not even worth seeding."
,diabollos_666,2013-05-03T05:15Z,Has anyone seen this? Is it any good? Can't believe there are no comments.
,diabollos_666,2013-05-03T05:19Z,Has anyone seen this yet? Is the movie any good? What about the quality of the rip? Can't believe there are no comments. Guess I'll download it and comment how it was later.
,diabollos_666,2013-05-03T08:34Z,"Alright, I've watched the whole thing. It was pretty bad I have to say. It's a really low budget British remake of Night of the Living Dead with really bad acting. A few of the zombies are done pretty well and look great but most of them are just regular people ""acting"" as zombies without any makeup or anything. It was released last year, but it looks really old and dated. The first 20 minutes is a black British dude driving his car listening to reports on the radio and didn't really have anything to do with the main story so it's kinda there for no reason. The next 40 minutes after that are a bunch of people holed up in a house talking to each other. That's correct, they don't get attacked or fight zombies until an entire hour into the movie (aside from the poorly acted intro). It's really bad guys, really really bad. Even me, being a hardcore zombie movie fan, could not find any redeeming qualities in this movie."
