,Ignusdej,2013-05-02T01:36Z,"Please, for fucks sake, don't buy this game! Pirate it, but don't spend money on it. Phil Fish, this asshole of developer doesn't deserve a single penny."
,DefenderArcade,2013-05-02T07:35Z,"What is with all the hate for Phil Fish? Triple A Japanese games are not innovative anymore, not a very P C way of saying it but the truth. And After all the hate he still won IGF award (twice in 4 years), & told all the fan boys to suck it! If you like the game buy it, say what u say but the man has talent. This is a INDIE developer not fucking EA come-on stop being trolls"
,virtualmatrix258,2013-05-02T08:25Z,@DefenderArcade He called PC gamers nerds and then rushed this console port. He went on the Steam forums and started fights with customers and then just bailed. He's a fucking douchebag and I'm pirating this game solely to pass it around at work.
,DefenderArcade,2013-05-02T09:13Z,"@virtualmatrix258

Most gamers are! Shit since I started playing games on PC my nerd level went over 9,000.This guy makes them,so wtf does that make him?lol. Hes a asshole yea. But people are way toooo sensitive."
