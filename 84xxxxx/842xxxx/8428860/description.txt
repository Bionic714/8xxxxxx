Translated from the French by Madame Zadah-Guerin


Paul Sedir
Paul Sedir, (Yves Leloup), was a French mystic of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. There are stories about Sedir to the effect that he never lost an opportunity to speak with and teach new souls about the spiritual life and the great necessity for a turning around of our lives especially in this day and age, that he walked many miles during a strike in Paris to lecture for one single person, that he followed his conscience and inner intuition on basically every choice he made.
