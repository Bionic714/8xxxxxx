This miniseries is shipping 4 times this month, as 258.1 to 258.4

I think this is like the X-Men Forever series, with the old writer returning to tell a story picking up right after he left the book. In this case, the late 1980's. (Many fans know Marvel already did "Armor Wars II", with Byrne writing and Romita Jr. penciling.)

It's disappointing that Layton's only inking this. --STFmaryville
