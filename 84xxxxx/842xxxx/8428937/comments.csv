The torrent is not Sleeping With Sirens.  It is 6 songs by a band called ""Who Invited the Wolf?""     Uploader can burn in hell.  Thanks for wasting my fucking time you dick."

track 2 has kurt travis who was in Dance gavin dance/ currently in a lot like birds, and I think track 5 has Garret Rapp from the Color Morale, it sounds very much like him towards the end. Really good sounding stuff though thats for sure. Surprising"
