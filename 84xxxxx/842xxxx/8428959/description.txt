Jude Welton looks at a hundred of the most common figures of speech in this visual workbook designed as a springboard for family and classroom discussions. Each figure of speech is accompanied by an illustration showing its literal meaning, which will help AS children recognize and learn to enjoy metaphors and figurative language. The book can be used by parents one-to-one with their ASD child. Teachers can also use the book as the basis for classroom work on figurative language.

Review
'Figures of speech can often cause confusion for young children - "they had a ball" doesn't necessarily conjure up the image of people having a good time...A new visual workbook, What did you say? What did you mean?, designed as a springboard for discussion, looks at 100 most common figures of speech. The accompanying illustration showing its literal meaning will help children recognise and learn to enjoy metaphors and figurative language.' - Practical Professional Child Care "Jude Welton has given us a truly helpful introduction into the world of metaphor... Any parent or teacher working with Asperger's will find it beginning to open the doors of imagination for the child in ways that they might not have thought possible. A lovely and practical book, which children and grownups can enjoy - and giggle over - together." - from the Foreword, by Elizabeth Newson --from the Foreword, by Elizabeth Newson
