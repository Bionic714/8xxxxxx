For some reason, this album was absent from the Interwebs. Figuring that someone
should do something about that, I present this rip. Enjoy and seed.

Please note: Because of the MPAA/RIAA's pathetic new campaign to make ISPs their 
flunkies, I am now *requiring* full stream encryption for all BitTorrent connections.
If you aren't encrypted, I can't upload to you; upgrade to a modern client!
