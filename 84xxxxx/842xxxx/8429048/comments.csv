,PPierce34,2013-05-02T23:58Z,Thank you so much. This is the only episode 3 release for english speaking people. I hope you continue to upload these episodes.
,PPierce34,2013-05-06T14:45Z,Can we get episode 4?
,Omega420,2013-05-18T05:22Z,what the hell? i can't get the audio track for English to work on my ps3 media server. and why is it so damn hard to find this show in English? it was filmed in English and wrote in it so what the fuck? do i have to spend the time to edit this shit and upload my own version for people because dipshits can't upload this the way it was filmed?

Ah, thank you for this. This info is especially helpful to me personally because for whatever reason these dual language files did not work on my WD TV Live player, and I don't want to watch them on my computer.
