The Cove
 In graphic, spine chilling footage we see the fate of the remaining few hundred dolphins. These are brutally, inhumanely bludgeoned to death before being sold off as meat. Evidence of rampant corruption is unleashed to the Japanese public as the illegal toxicity levels of mercury found in the dolphin meat is exposed.
Director Louie Psihoyos justifies his need for the secret, undercover filming as his attempts to openly collect footage of the cove are met with threats of violence from the local fishermen and intimidation by the Japanese authorities.
DVD Release Date: 5 April 2011
