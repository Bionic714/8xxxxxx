This lovingly produced 2-CD set celebrates the prolific musical partnership of country legend Bobby Bare and folk singer-songwriter and provocative Playboy cartoonist Shel Silverstein. Bare’s classic 1973 concept album is here reissued along with a second disc of 16 alternately witty and insightful Silverstein songs from subsequent Bare albums on Columbia, Mercury and RCA.
