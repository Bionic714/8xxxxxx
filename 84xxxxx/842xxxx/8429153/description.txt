Jolene is Dolly Parton's 13th solo studio album, produced by Bob Ferguson. It was released by RCA Records in February 1974.

The title track, Jolene, tells the tale of a housewife confronting a beautiful seductress who she believes is having an affair with her husband. It became Parton's second solo number-one country single, it also was a moderate pop hit for her, and also did well in the United Kingdom. It has been covered by numerous performers.

The album was released around the time Parton was embarking on a solo career, after having spent seven years as part of Porter Wagoner's weekly TV series and road show, and one of the album's songs, I Will Always Love You, was reportedly written to express the remorse Parton felt over the professional breakup. Released as the album's second single, it also became a number-one country single. In 1992, Whitney Houston's version of I Will Always Love You was a mega-hit pop ballad. (wikipedia)
