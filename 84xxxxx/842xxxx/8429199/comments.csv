I mean at beginning scene of this copy any scene  is cut off and also a guy walks around the cam in the cinema seat. Is this different copy or still same copy all around."

The video source is the same that is being shared as non-HD by everyone else, and it is only 720x272 (approx).  This was just stretched and the poster thinks that pixels will magically appear to fill in the missing space so this becomes HD.

What I really, really want to know is what the groups (or manic individuals) get out of this.  They keep on doing it, even though they are identified as fakes, so there must be something in it for them..."

You have no clue what HD means then. HD is not always the crystal clear image a multi-gigabyte bluray rip provides. HD is simply a high pixel count. This 1920x804 video more than qualifies as ""HD"", regardless of your opinion."

Terrible plot, awful dialogue.  Just full of noise and special effects.  Vacuous - yes I know it's a fantasy but this film demonstrates that there is a limit to fantasy by going well beyond it.

,baresurr,2013-05-05T15:29Z,"HD are several standarized formats, either 720 or 1080, these are a number of pixels on screen simultaneously, the quality of complexity of pixels are depended on several factors, it can be as shitty as this and it can be as good as blueray, the set of pixels are HD, but the quality is very bad, HD is a term that the logical brain tries to strictly define, if they tried to record the movie from a distance so far away that it only filled one pixel while filming a film in pure HD making a movie with this movie filling 1 pixel in the background, this movie would be filmed by a HD camera watched on a HD screen, but is the film itself HD in its presentation if its one pixel?

It is technically HD in that it is in HD format. Much in the same way I can take a panoramic picture of a house but I stand 2 inches away from a wall taking it then it won't make a difference, just be a very wide picture of a wall.

On the other hand, HD used in this context tends to mean quality rather than format. In that respect it fails horribly."

--

I have ABSOLUTELY no problem watching cams.. I have done it for years! I have watched some TERRIBLE cams in my day! There are just some things you cant deal with! We can deal with average cam video quality, and the tinny echo of the audio.. thats a normal cam. However when parts of the movie are in another language, or the video looks like it was recorded by a 1991 video camera, there is some fat guys head taking up 1/3 of the video the whole time.. There is just shit not worthy of being uploaded in the first place!

So you guys saying ""omg stop bitching about quality, go to the movies if you wanna bitch it's free"" can go eat a dog's asshole!

Most of us KNOW what to expect with a CAM and we accept the fact it is low quality, low audio (compared to DVD). We have seen PLENTY of cams that look great (for a cam!), so it is possible.. but when you see a cam that looks like it was recorded in a 3rd world country with a 1990s video camcorder, even us normal cam watchers get sick and tired of it.

I can go to walmart and get a $250 JVC HD camcorder that will make everyone say ""omg great cam"".. So there is no excuse for the complete TRASH that gets uploaded!

We are not asking for perfect DVD quality cams, we are just saying: It is FUCKING 2013, get with the times! And if you have to chop and put the movie together like Frankenstein and half the audio is in another language, then don't wast your time! Why clog up TPB with floods of shitty ass cams, and put up shit with your little skull?

If you say its English audio, and you had to steal russian audio to fill gaps.. or chunks of the movie are missing, or if the movie could go in the ""top 10 worst quality cams"" list, then dont fucking upload it!

Without rules, everything will fall apart. And the pirate bay has no rules.. So do the math, it's crumbling...

The arguing is just gonna get worse! The uploading shit, is going to get worst, and posting in the wrong categories is going to get worse. Someone needs to keep a clean house."
