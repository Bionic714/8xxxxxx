NTSC)))"
,LadyOfThe80s,2013-05-02T16:07Z,"Yes, thanks, I was about to complñete the missing data.
NTSC, 4:3 like most old TV movies, and... damn! no subtitles, not even captions. I guess I'll have to make them myself. Image quality is pretty good.
You know, I've just placed a request for this movie about a couple of weeks ago in another tracker. So, thanks a lot, pal! :)"
