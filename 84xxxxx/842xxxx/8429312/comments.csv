,dib_tpb,2013-05-02T02:27Z,"According to the description on other sites, it should be a fan remake of SMB3 using resources from New SMB for Wii."
,manfestos,2013-05-03T02:38Z,"Guys, I found 1 video. 
Channel ""Semideiassl"" they make 1 video."
,manfestos,2013-05-03T02:39Z,"1 video in Youtube, the name is ""Super Mario Bros 3+ [Wii] - Demonstração"""
,ClipperCigars,2013-05-07T03:34Z,"Wow. This looks sweet. Thanx. 

Hope it works. I've had problems in the past with these fan remakes loading regardless of the cios or loader used. Anyone test it yet?"
,ClipperCigars,2013-05-08T02:42Z,"Follow up. Yes, it works.

It is NSMB with all the levels edited to be SMB3 levels, not SMB3 using NSMB assets. 

What this means is that you have the NSMB intro and map screens, also the toad people getting toad-napped side quests.

Another factor to remember is some levels won't be playable exactly the same because of the different assets. IE: You don't have the tanooki suit, you get the propeller suit instead, which means you can't do a spinning tail slap to kill enemies or break blocks. I seem to remember that was somewhat important in some levels, so not sure how that will play out.

Any who, it is a worthy download regardless. If for no other reason than to give props to the guy who took the time to edit all the levels.
