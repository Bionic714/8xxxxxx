,Dramat,2013-06-10T20:45Z,"This was first game of yours ""nosTEAM"" I've downloaded and it will be the LAST.

First of all when game finished installing ALL my internet browsers (4 of them!!!) I have has opened and tried to connect to your site and one more site - I do not know what kind, because I killed my internter connection as always when I'm installing downloaded games. 

Second of all when the game finally launches IN THE GAME I saw your logo and when EA logo was shown your logo again with your website address.

My question: WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ???

I've downloaded many games from many different sources but NONE tried to pull shit like you did. 

I DO NOT recommend this or any other torrent of this team. Download normal version crack and update it yourself. You won't have to deal with any trash in the way."
