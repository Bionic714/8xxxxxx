About the Game:

Mirror's Edge is a single-player first person action-adventure platform video game developed by EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and published by Electronic Arts.
In Mirror's Edge, the player controls the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective as she is challenged to navigate across a gleaming city, by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts. 
This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour.
In gameplay, the character's momentum becomes an asset. 
The player must attempt to conserve it through fluidity of physical actions, encouraging the creation of chains of moves.
If Faith does not have the momentum required to traverse an object, she will fall off or short of it.
The player character can hold weapons, but O'Brien stressed that "this is an action adventure: We're not positioning this as a shooter - the focus isn't on the gun, it's on the person." 
Gameplay in Mirror's Edge focuses on finding the best route through the game's environments while combat takes a secondary role. 
Completing the game without shooting a single enemy unlocks an achievement for the player.....
