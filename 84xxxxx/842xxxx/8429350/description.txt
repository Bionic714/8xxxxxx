I received a copy of this at some convention from a very strange man with golden long hair. A few days later I popped it in the dvd player and low and behold the worst movie I had ever seen... A horrible tale of Dragons and Faggotry. I think the world needs to see this and use it as a template of what to avoid when making a film.

A film by Aeyron Moore.
