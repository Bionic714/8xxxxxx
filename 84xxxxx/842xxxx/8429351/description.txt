[Song] Kinetics and One Love - The New Colossus

Lyrics:

YeahΓÇªthe way my brain is connected onto my spinal cord
Got me flyin' over the continent on a dinosaur 
I rhyme enormous, like a Tyrannosaurus 
With the force of a thesaurus throughout the course of my chorus
And the reason why my listeners are holdin' their breath
I rock the mic right, like the Coriolis effect
In the Northern Hemisphere, and many men will fear the wrath of me
That's why they actin' passively when I tell 'em to battle me
I could turn ya shirt a shade of purple
And now I got 'em sweatin' like an athlete in a Gatorade commercial 
But I been spittin' clean like I'm sippin' Listerine
I could kick a 16, and have ya ship in smithereens 
So if you wanna prevent disasters, then pull your men backwards 
'Cause they get bent faster than a pair of LensCrafters 
And every time I aim and I shoot 
I'm like Europe when Italy became a country 'cause I gave 'em the bootΓÇªGrazie! 

[Chorus]:
So come to the promise land I'll get rid of your misery
I'll be standin' at the water like the State of Liberty 
Yo this music is monotonous, I elevate the process 
Standin' at the tip of metropolis like Colossus
Call me Helios, watching over the port
But I hold a microphone instead of holdin' a torch
And I'm definitely wearin' the crown
But unlike the World Wonder, ain't no earthquake tearin' me down,

My brain power is that of a rain shower
On top of the airwaves of a radio plane tower 
With eighty aviators afraid of a rainy day 
They callin' it air traffic, it's really a scare tactic
So now I got the competition panickin'
'Cause I'm so high that I'm walking on the sky like Anakin 
A Jedi Knight when I write, fuck a light saber
I could prolly fight Vader with a piece of white paper
You a Star Wars motherfucker natural born looser
You should go and film a porn blooper with a storm trooper
I swarm super duper, I'm droppin' shit like a pooper scooper
Little Oompa Loompas get taken out like a movie blooper (Bdddat!)
The part of passion that's in your heart is unpractical
Yo these artists actin' like Leonardo DiCaprio 
'Cause you really thinkin' that your shit don't stink
You on the Titanic thinkin' that the ship won't sink 


[Chorus]



Yeah...the way my brain is connected onto my spinal cord
Got me flyin' over the continent on a dinosaur
Flappin' in the battle on back of a pterodactyl
You rappers are gettin' tackled and temporarily shackled
Incase you care to skedaddle, escape isn't really plausible 
Rap as loud as you want but to me your skill is inaudible 
Yo this beat is makin' me turn to a Transformer
You goin' need a camcorder to capture the manslaughter 
And all of my fans oughta come over my land's boarders
They saw the Statue of Liberty and they ran toward her
So why would I dumb it down? I relate to the geeks better
I could prolly speak better if I spit in Greek letters
Like kappa, iota, nu, epsilon, tau
Iota, kappa, sigma, homie now you break it down (down, down)
And I'm about to see the dollars
'Cause like a Jewish bakery, I'm makin' people holla 
And a lot of people go to shows 
If they had a comic of my concert, every fan would be blowin' Os
Little white circles in the voice bubble 
'Cause they diggin' it like a little kid with a toy shovel 
So gather all ya infantry into the trench, quick
'Cause like Lady Liberty, Kinetics was a French gift
And Timmy Talent is a hazardous male
Now that I have him backin' me, rappers will naturally fail 
Now that I found the hidden treasure, man I have to prevail 
Like the casket of Mary Magdalene attached to the Grail
Call me the savior of the music, New York City is my Nazareth 
The Statue of Liberty, lyrically I'm Emma Lazarus
So give me all your tired, and give me all your poor 
And I'ma give you back a fire that they don't make anymore 
And for all the huddled masses that are washin' up on shore 
I'ma lift the microphone and hold open the doorΓÇªyo one love

[Chorus]
