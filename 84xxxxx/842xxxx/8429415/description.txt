Billy Ray Cyrus is an award-winning country music legend whose ΓÇ£Achy Breaky HeartΓÇ¥ propelled his debut album, Some Gave All, to the top of the charts for a record-breaking seventeen weeks. HeΓÇÖs also father of Miley Cyrus, one of HollywoodΓÇÖs most successful young stars, who grew up on stage and on screen, most famously as the lead on the Disney ChannelΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Hannah Montana,ΓÇ¥ where Billy Ray Cyrus played her father. But sometimes the truth is even better than fiction. Now, for the first time, fans can read about CyrusΓÇÖs tenacious and inspiring struggle to find his own way to faith, family, and the power of music.

Hillbilly Heart opens during CyrusΓÇÖs turbulent childhood in Kentucky, where he sought refuge in music and sports after his parentsΓÇÖ divorce. He was a troublemaker in training, known more for pulling pranks than for following in his preacher grandfatherΓÇÖs much-vaunted footsteps. But when he heard a voice telling him to get a left-handed guitar and start a band, this rebel found his cause. Ten years later, after tirelessly working the club circuit and knocking on the closed doors of music executives from Nashville to Los Angeles, Cyrus finally made a stratospheric breakthrough, becoming a multi-platinum selling artist and taking his rock-and-roll twist on country music to the worldΓÇÖs stage.

Cyrus fans have always been able to piece together the details of his life through his lyricsΓÇöthe ups and downs, adventures and disappointmentsΓÇöbut Hillbilly Heart gives them a front row seat for his most candid performance ever.
