This is from the original scanner. I adjusted the resolution and compressed the file for easier reading on tablets and ereaders. I have added 'Tablet Edition' to the name to avoid confusion.

Enjoy and please seed back.

Transported through time to 2013, the original pulp heroine is tasked with hunting down cloaked Nazi secret agents in modern-day Washington. But as she suffers ever worsening mental flashes back to the 1940s and to a war-ravaged future, Miss Fury is forced to question her own sanity. Is any of this real? What are the giant triangular craft hovering over future Manhattan? And is the man she's supposed to assassinate really a Nazi agent, or is this just murder?
