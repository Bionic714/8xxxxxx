From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, May 1 edition of the Alex Jones Show, veteran guest host Mike Adams "The Health Ranger" fills in for Alex breaking down the potential dangers of a new government funded mobile app designed to track and report the location of "vaccine refusers" with Jeffrey John Aufderheide of VacTruth.org. 

Mike will also speak with Wayne Allyn Root, author of the book, The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide: How to Survive, Thrive, and Prosper During Obamageddon.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
