Nine-year-old Tommy Woodry has a history of making things up, but he insists he really saw this: a murder in his own apartment building! No one believes Tommy's story. No one except the killers. From its taut pursuits to its sinister sense of danger lurking behind any apartment door, The Window is a minor gem of film noir. Bobby Driscoll, playing perhaps the genre's youngest protagonist, received an honorary OscarΓö¼┬½* for his portrayal of the imperiled boy. Noted cinematographer Ted Tetzlaff (Notorious) directs, ramping up the tension in this film based on a story by Cornell Woolrich (Rear Window).
