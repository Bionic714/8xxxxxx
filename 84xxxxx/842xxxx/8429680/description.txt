Samantha Rousseau is used to getting her hands dirty. Working toward a masterΓÇÖs degree in wildlife biology while helping take care of her sick father, she has no time for celebrity gossip, designer clothes, or lazy vacations. So when a duchess from the small country of Lilaria invites her to dinner, Samantha assumes itΓÇÖs to discuss a donation for the program. The truth will change the course of her life in ways she never dreamed.

Alex DΓÇÖLynsal is trying to keep his name clean. As crown prince of Lilaria, heΓÇÖs had his share of scandalous headlines, but the latest pictures have sent him packing to America and forced him to swear off womenΓÇöespecially women in the public eye. That is, until he meets Samantha Rousseau. SheΓÇÖs stubborn, feisty, and incredibly sexy. Not to mention heiress to an estate in his country, which makes her everyoneΓÇÖs front-page news.

While Sam tries to navigate the new world of politics and wealth, she will also have to dodge her growing feelings for Alex. Giving in to them means more than just falling in love; it would mean accepting the weight of an entire country on her shoulders.


Seed and Enjoy!
