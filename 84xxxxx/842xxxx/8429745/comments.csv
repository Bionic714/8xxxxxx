,The_Barman,2013-05-04T01:42Z,IndiE congratulations. Your best list ever. I myself like all of it. Although I do not think all my customers are as willing to listen. For them I myself make playlists (Dutch Treat) and usually I use a few songs from many playlists. This time however many songs must come from one source. I would like to hear a Sweetlist (Trip through your Music world) from you.

,mido_remedie,2013-05-06T16:26Z,sorry but the comments (see counter) did not work via my own account. So it became kind of double :)

A sweetlist? Sounds like a great idea. From my entire collection, past and present. I will work on that. 

I think the list I'm still most proud of is the Best Of The Year, 2009. So much of it has stuck with me for years now and I always describe it as the radio station I wish existed. And it is very, very diverse.

Thanks for the kind words. See you in June!"
