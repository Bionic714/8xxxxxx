This is not a history of World War II , but revelations about many of the
lesser-known details. Because it is a book of facts, you don't read it
from beginning to end, but rather you jump in wherever it strikes your
fancy. There are over three hundred separate items, each a complete
story in itself.

As a rule, much of the information found in one section of the book
will usually also be applicable to the others as well. After all, although
aircraft carriers are inseparably associated with the Pacific war, they
also performed yeoman service in the Atlantic and Mediterranean,
while the problems of troop transport transcended theater.

After reading this book, you'll never look at World War II
the same way again. We have not changed the story of that conflict; we are
providing information about it that is not generally known. We often
look at the same subject from several different angles, giving you a
better appreciation of, for example, how a blitzkrieg was conducted,
what it took to supply partisans, and why the U.S. Army had more
ships than the U.S. Navy.
