,chucktuna,2013-05-02T06:27Z,"Naaa... There were three episodes last fall. I thought it was going to just be a short miniseries, but it's back for a second season now.  Here's the epguide I found on the net so far.  There may be more to come this year, dunno.

I found a list on RAGE and so far they have seven more episodes listed for this spring.  (four of which are already out)  I LOVe this show... has a lot of interesting mindfreak stuff in it.  Optical illusions, etc.
