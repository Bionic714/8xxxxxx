OMFG folks! Let me hold your hand and walk you thru the installation. SMH.

1. Extract the 7z file with 7zip/winrar,(on pc) or B1 archiver (on android). 
2. On android phone- make a folder called Android(it may already be there) on sdcards root (ie. mnt/sdcard/Android. Make sure the 'a' is capital.
3. Make a new folder called obb (all lowercase) inside Android folder.
4. Move or copy and paste the 'com.imageline.FLM' folder to the obb folder.(inside the 'com.imageline.FLM' folder should be 'main.11.com.imageline.FLM.obb.
5. Install the FL Studio Mobile apk file.
6. Run the app.
7. Stop saying my torrent is no good.
8. Make music
9. Profit"
