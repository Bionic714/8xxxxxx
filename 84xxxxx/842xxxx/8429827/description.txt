Every day, tens of thousands of people arrive at CanadaΓÇÖs border crossings. Most are legitimate travelers, but not all of them. From Canadian citizens with undeclared food to international drug smugglers; from confused visitors to phony immigrants; from impaired drivers to wanted felons. Border services officers see them all, and need to figure out which is which ΓÇô keeping Canada safe from threats of all kinds, big and small.

The series features exclusive access behind the scenes at the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Produced by VancouverΓÇÖs Force Four Entertainment for Shaw Media, Border Security: CanadaΓÇÖs Front Line shadows CBSA officers at work at air, land, and marine crossings in BCΓÇÖs Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.

Cameras document the officers as they interrogate suspicious passengers from around the world. They meet illegal workers posing as tourists and visitors smuggling contraband. They find toys packed with drugs and weapons disguised as cell phones. Some of the travelers lie and argue, while others play the victim or plead ignorance. Through all of these encounters, officers are ready with an arsenal of investigative tactics. Each episode follows CBSA officers on actual cases as they examine those travelers that raise suspicion, chipping away at the inconsistencies until the truth is finally revealed.
