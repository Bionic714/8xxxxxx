despite what other comments are saying i found it very watchable with VLC player of course. it does cut out the very ending like a minute probably but the uploader says it in his description so a big THANK YOU to the uploader"

,WakeDude,2013-05-20T10:24Z,"nice movie, quality is ok for a cam. thanks"
,stifler2009,2013-05-22T04:03Z,"Great cam! All you leechers complaining, go buy a new pc or a better TV. This cam is awesome! It is near VHS quality. If you wanna complain and say ""ill wait for another"" do us all a favor. Wait in line at the frigging movie theater with your fat ass chick you cant afford a movie on, and pay $12 for a ticket. Save our bandwith. Wanker"
