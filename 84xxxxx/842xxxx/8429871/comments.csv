Thank you MVGroup.
After watching all these farming BBC programs I was shocked to discover that Britain was a communist country... no wonder Allies were played so easily by Stalin - resulting in HALF of Europe being under marxist boot (more than original Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact's plan!).
Margaret warned Britons to stay AWAY from EU... Now they know - another expensive lesson to be learned..."
