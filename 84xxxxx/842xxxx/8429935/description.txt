An obsessively completist checklist of coolΓÇöcovering lifestyle, fashion, music, movies, body art, and more.
The Indie Cred Test is the ultimate test of hipness. Sixteen chapters and countless sidebars cover musicians, authors, hipsters, hippies, miniature toy poodles, and everything in between. Part pop culture quiz, part satire, part handbook of all things cool, this fun and fascinating book is The Official Preppy Handbook meets The Hipster Handbook, plus massive amounts of (what else?) indie cred.

Readers can put their indie cred to the test by answering such questions and prompts as:

ΓÇó Explain McSweeneyΓÇÖs.
ΓÇó Is a bike your primary form of transportation?
ΓÇó Is there any kind of T-shirt that canΓÇÖt be worn ironically?
ΓÇó Has Courtney Love ever taken a swing at you?
