Mind OSTM, the operating system of the human mind, is just as it sounds. It is a
foundation on which a set of information from any area of human inquiry can operate,
just as software programs run on a computer operating system. However, as you may
know, a software program could be wonderfully useful, but is only as practical and useful
as the operating system it runs on. Mind OSTM is the next generation of self-help, and it
is simultaneously what some have called the ΓÇ£holy grailΓÇ¥ of psychology theory. It is the
only comprehensive Unification Theory and system, synthesized from all former schools
of psychology theory and self-help. As such, it integrates only the best of the best of
works you have already read, and makes them work together at a higher level of
usefulness to your life. It uses everyday language you know wellΓÇöwords like ΓÇ£stressΓÇ¥,
ΓÇ£failureΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£self-esteemΓÇ¥, and it uses diagrams to economize on your crystal clear
understanding. I want to start an epidemic of personal empowerment.
