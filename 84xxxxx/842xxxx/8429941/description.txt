Eagles - Catalogue CD Album Box (2005 Limited Edition) [FLAC]


Greater than a hand-plucked menagerie of hits and outtakes, this box set is just thatΓÇöa complete set of the six studio (and one live) albums, in their originally sequenced entirety, recorded during the 1970s decade in which the Eagles helped define. The nine-CD collection plays chronologically, beginning with the folk-rock pace and Everly Brothers harmonies of the 1972 self-titled debut ("Take It Easy," "Witchy Woman," "Peaceful Easy Feeling") and the 1973 Western concept album, Desperado ("Tequila Sunrise," "Desperado"). Don Henley and Glenn Frey added guitarist Don Felder as the band steered in a rock direction for 1974ΓÇÖs On the Border ("Already Gone," "James Dean") and toward a polished, FM-ready sound for 1975ΓÇÖs One Of These Nights ("Take it to the Limit," "LyinΓÇÖ Eyes") before guitarist Joe Walsh joined as the Eagles reached their mainstream apex in 1976 with Hotel California ("New Kid In Town," "Life in the Fast Lane," "Hotel California"). While The Long Run in 1979 didnΓÇÖt measure up to its predecessor, it did fire off three successful singles--"Heartache Tonight," "The Long Run" and "I CanΓÇÖt Tell You Why"--and led to the farewell tour that resulted in 1980ΓÇÖs Eagles Live, 15 concert cuts (followed by a pair of holiday recordings) that close out the box set and the pre-reunion career of one of AmericaΓÇÖs most revered bands.
