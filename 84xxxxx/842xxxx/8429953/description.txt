Blue Öyster Cult (often abbreviated BÖC) is an American rock band from Long Island, New York, United States, best known for such hard rock songs as "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", "Burnin' for You", and "Godzilla". Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially "Burnin' for You", received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÖC's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.

Blue Öyster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald "Buck Dharma" Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).

Spectres is the fifth studio album by Blue Öyster Cult, released in November 1977. The album was certified gold in January 1978 and contained the album rock hits "Godzilla", "Death Valley Nights", "R.U. Ready 2 Rock" and "I Love the Night".

The cover art is demonstrative of BÖC's use of lasers in their live show at that time. While the album didn't have the lasting power of its predecessor Agents of Fortune, it is a BÖC fan favorite.

A remaster of this album was released on CD on February 13, 2007, which included four previously unreleased outtakes from Spectres sessions as bonus tracks.

"Goin' Through the Motions" was later covered by Bonnie Tyler on her album Faster Than the Speed of Night.

As of June 2012, this is the last studio album to have been remastered and reissued with bonus tracks in the BÖC catalogue.
