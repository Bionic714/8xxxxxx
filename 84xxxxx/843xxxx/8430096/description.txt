Ever since the one time Andie Weber threw caution to the wind - and paid the price for it - sheΓÇÖs learned that itΓÇÖs safer and smarter to live life playing by the rules. Now sheΓÇÖs got a great apartment, a steady job, and a wonderful boyfriend in Colin; heΓÇÖs sweet, stable, and essentially perfect ΓÇô except maybe for the fact that his best friend is Chase.

Chase McGuire lives his carefree, unstructured life strictly for himself. Dripping sarcasm and oozing wit, he refuses to censor his feelings or opinions for anyone, making no apologies for either and wearing his abrasiveness like a badge of honor. No one has ever gotten under AndieΓÇÖs skin the way Chase does ΓÇô and vice versa.

So when Andie and Chase find themselves forced to take a two-day road trip together, they are already dreading an inevitable all-out war. But as the trip progresses, and the undeniable friction that has always defined their relationship slowly begins to wear away their preconceived notions of each other, Andie and Chase discover they both have a lot to learn about life, courage, happiness, and the age-old battle between logic and love.


Seed and Enjoy!
