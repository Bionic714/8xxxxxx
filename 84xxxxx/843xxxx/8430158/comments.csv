,Hellfighter911,2013-05-03T04:15Z,"Yes, please seed!! Still waiting to d/l the episode. Seed! It won't take long to build a good seed group.."

,nl_spacecowboy,2013-05-03T17:26Z,Come on there are only 7 seeder and 220 leechers. I am only gettin .2kb to 1kb If you want these torrent to stay alive and TvTeam to keep doing this show we cant just d/l and then quit we need more seeders. I will seed for up to a week if I can ever get the files in the first place!
,plockness,2013-05-03T19:46Z,"this is absolutly retarted!!! been tryin to download this file and the next one for a couple days.. what the fuck is really going on??? can someone just continue to seed so some of us who do seed , can do so .... FUCKIN GREEEEEEDY SCUM"
,ryders333,2013-05-04T06:23Z,"don't think this is an issue of people being gready, the issue is these were never seeded to begin with, no one has anything to share"
[T],trialNerror,2013-05-04T10:55Z,"When a torrent fails you need a backup plan. 

Go get the video from another site - a file locker - don't be scared - they're harmless - and instead of sitting here bitching about something not being seeded you could've had the file a long time ago. 

For plan B try something like tv-release dot net ... that's just 1 site - there are dozens out there. Ask a friend or do some searching. Hint, these are scene releases ... try searching that phrase to find a couple other sites that list the releases with download options. You'll find your shit there outside the bittorrent network. Hell, you'll find shit there that hasn't hit the bittorrent network yet.

Class is over. Dismissed. "
