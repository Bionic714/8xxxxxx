,nl_spacecowboy,2013-05-03T17:24Z,Come on there are only 4 seeder and 200 leechers. I am only gettin .2kb to 1kb If you want these torrent to stay alive and TvTeam to keep doing this show we cant just d/l and then quit we need more seeders. I will seed for up to a week if I can ever get the files in the first place!
,ryders333,2013-05-04T06:21Z,"ummm, i think the problem is that these were never seeded to beging with.  it might say ur getting .2kb/s, but i bet if u look, it says u've DLed 0 kbs.  it's not a problem of people not sharing."
[T],trialNerror,2013-05-04T10:56Z,"When a torrent fails you need a backup plan. 

Go get the video from another site - a file locker - don't be scared - they're harmless - and instead of sitting here bitching about something not being seeded you could've had the file a long time ago. 

For plan B try something like tv-release dot net ... that's just 1 site - there are dozens out there. Ask a friend or do some searching. Hint, these are scene releases ... try searching that phrase to find a couple other sites that list the releases with download options. You'll find your shit there outside the bittorrent network. Hell, you'll find shit there that hasn't hit the bittorrent network yet.

Class is over. Dismissed. "
