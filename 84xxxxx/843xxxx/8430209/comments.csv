How is this supposed to work if everyone just leeches?"

[T],trialNerror,2013-05-04T10:59Z,"When a torrent fails you need a backup plan. 

Go get the video from another site - a file locker - don't be scared - they're harmless - and instead of sitting here bitching about something not being seeded you could've had the file a long time ago. 

For plan B try something like tv-release dot net ... that's just 1 site - there are dozens out there. Ask a friend or do some searching. Hint, these are scene releases ... try searching that phrase to find a couple other sites that list the releases with download options. You'll find your shit there outside the bittorrent network. Hell, you'll find shit there that hasn't hit the bittorrent network yet.

Class is over. Dismissed. "
