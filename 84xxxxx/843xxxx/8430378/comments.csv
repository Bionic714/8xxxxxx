,trblewalkn,2013-05-03T22:48Z,"Stuck at 98.1% Someone please seed the last 1.9%!
And can some one please post the On Deck show that is before each episode?"
,longpole001,2013-05-04T08:20Z,"no seeds , stuck at 98%"
,randy80,2013-05-04T18:04Z,"Come on guys, 167 leechers and no seeders this is BS! And yes, whoever uploaded The Bait, please be consistent and upload ALL pre-shows tks"
,flg8rfan,2013-05-05T13:57Z,"I don't think it was ever fully seeded.  It started downloading the moment it hit my feed, 4 days ago, and it never went above 94% availability until this morning when it went to 99.9% (but not 100, wtf)."
,randy80,2013-05-08T03:43Z,I think you're right. It was in limbo from the get-go for me also.
