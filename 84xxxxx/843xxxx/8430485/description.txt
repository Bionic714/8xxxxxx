With chopped falsetto vocals, filthy funk bass, and many a formaggio guitar solo lurking, it's not hard to see that young pretenders Letherette have been influenced by Daft Punk - thereΓÇÖs even a photo online of the Wolverhampton duo imitating their Parisian muses, DJing behind D.I.Y. masks. So, for those of you whoΓÇÖve been waiting since 2005, Andy Harber and Richard RobertsΓÇÖ debut release will certainly tide you over until the end of May.

Admittedly, the start of Letherette is dominated by just the sort of careening synth scales that so defined Discovery,with lead single ΓÇÿD&TΓÇÖ a perfectly plausible Daft Punk album track, all housefunk and squealing falsetto samples. ΓÇÿWarstonesΓÇÖ - an instant, exuberant highlight ΓÇô has been resurrected from an earlier EP and is still clearly channelling the robot masked ones. But, itΓÇÖs so good that if you put it up online as a Random Access Memories leak, much of the internet would be lost in exaltation. While the inspiration is clear, Letherette add trickling, shimmering synths never yet heard on a DP release, as well as a pounding house beat thatΓÇÖs more reminiscent of His Majesty Andre than the discofunk of Bangalter and Homem-Christo, stamping their own mark on the sound.

Though the boys have evidently done their homework and made a few important discoveries regarding French electro, thereΓÇÖs more to them than mere copycat soundalikes. Another sky-rocketing success is the effect-laden, sub-aquatic bass of ΓÇÿThe OneΓÇÖ, which features borderline Timbaland ΓÇÿboom-click-boomΓÇÖ percussion and warm, washing synths before diving into throbbing bass and driving, dubby house more akin to JusticeΓÇÖs ΓÇÿD.A.N.C.E.ΓÇÖ than anything Daft Punkian. Elsewhere opener ΓÇÿAfter DawnΓÇÖΓÇÖs warm space synths and liquid, rumbling bass call to mind MGMTΓÇÖs Oracular Spectacular.

Along with the aforementioned disco -house, prog is certainly a core influence on Letherette. The albumΓÇÖs very structure ΓÇô slow, soaring intro, pulsing energy, ambient intermission, more disco exuberance, and a dreamy closing comedown ΓÇô lends it an immersive, spacious mood. Mid-album interlude ΓÇÿGas Stations and RestaurantsΓÇÖ drips echoing ambience and psychedelic vocals, building into the slow grooving ΓÇÿCold ClamΓÇÖ, where a niggling loop and shimmering synths creating a more downbeat Massive Attack-styled sound ΓÇô again, indicative of LetheretteΓÇÖs sonic breadth of vision. Final word ΓÇÿSay The SunΓÇÖ is an exercise in restrained euphoria, with calm synth loops laid over a proggy beat ΓÇô an electronic equivalent of ΓÇÿWish You Were HereΓÇÖ, wafting you back to reality.

Despite something of a slow start, Letherette builds into an expansive, absorbing album, spanning a huge variety of influences and threading them together impressively within a coherent framework. Like Messieurs Bangalter et Homem-Christo, itΓÇÖs dance music that effortlessly transcends day and night, and is fluid enough to please aficionados of many genres. Though the Parisian goliaths return this summer, it seems unlikely that this Wolverhampton duo will be lost in their shadows.

If only Daft Punk's new album sounded like this.. Enjoy and please seed.
