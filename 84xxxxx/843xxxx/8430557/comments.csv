can download 99.9% and no further.
players like vlc can normally cope with that, but I cannot play it at all."
,medo2nd,2013-05-02T09:45Z,"stuck at  99.9%
fuck"
,myfbusted,2013-05-02T10:18Z,The file is intentional missing the first piece of the file so that it will not be able to load at all on any media player. TvTeam can go straight to hell.
,matttyger,2013-05-02T12:31Z,"Sh!t, stuck at 99.9% as well... I'll download EZTV this time around :(
Unfortunately no other HD versions out there... Me no gusta"

,qlum,2013-05-02T14:33Z,"I may want to add here that the issue that may have caused it to be stuck at 99.9% is now fixed as I can download it fine. It sometimes happens that the person sharing the file gets offline at the wrong time and you can situations like this, it is however working fine now. "

,Bean-Bandit,2013-05-02T20:52Z,"@DoodleGod
It might have been fixed but people were stuck at 99.9% so."
,PHR16384,2013-05-03T02:59Z,"This one's legit.

It isn't *perfect* video quality, and it cuts off the end a bit, but it'll do until a high-quality 1080p version comes out.

+1 approval"

BTW. IMDB say, this is S14."
