Does anyone actually know what thats called when the picture separates and is unwatchable? I get it all the time, I often dload 2-3 version of each program and 1 or 2 always crap out. Prob a way to fix/convert the files for TV I dunno?"
,Gingasnapz,2013-05-02T15:19Z,what happened  to the avi version?
,damndl0ser,2013-05-03T06:12Z,"Brigzy, you probably just need to understand a little more about codecs.  This is X264 and you probably just need xvid or some other format that your tv states it will play.  X264's are generally small and don't need a lot of room but they need a bigger processor to make them play properly.  Your tv doesn't have the processing ability."
,weezarc,2013-05-03T23:52Z,"sound doesn't work right for me either.  my receiver doesn't play aac 5.1 (dts and dolby work fine) and that is what this torrent is instead of the usual aac 2.0 that all previous survivor HDTV rips use.  that is why i'm not getting any vocals, only background music.  hope that helps"
