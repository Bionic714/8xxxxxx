There are several rips about, but strangely, nobody has one in MKV with full chapters, subtitles and ripped to high quality. The blu-ray rip is superior to this, and has a commentary track, which this one does not. Still, if you want a simple, quality rip of just the original DVD, this is the one to take.


South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a 1999 American animated musical comedy film based on the animated television series South Park, created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The film was directed by Parker, who also stars along with the rest of the regular voice cast from the series, including Stone, Mary Kay Bergman, and Isaac Hayes as Chef. It features twelve songs by Parker and Marc Shaiman with additional lyrics by Stone. It was produced by Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. in association with Comedy Central.

The film parodies animated Disney films released during the Disney Renaissance such as Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid as well as musicals such as the West End's Les Mis√©rables, and satirizes the controversy surrounding the show itself. In the film, the four boys from South Park see a controversial R-rated movie featuring Canadians Terrance and Phillip. The boys begin cursing incessantly and their parents pressure the United States to wage war against Canada as a result of "corrupting" their children. The movie also heavily satirizes the Motion Picture Association of America; Parker and Stone battled the MPAA throughout the production process and the movie received an R rating just two weeks prior to its release.

The film was released in theaters on June 30, 1999, and on home video on November 23, 1999. The film went on to gross US$83 million worldwide in theaters, making it a box office hit while produced on a modest $21 million budget. The film was released to generally positive reviews from critics, who appreciated the humor, social satire, and political commentary. The song "Blame Canada" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1999.
