Sup guys its gamehaxxor, There is finally an aimbot available for tf2! The only real downside to this, is that the aimbot is a color aimbot. Which can actually have some good sides to it. And also some bad i will also include the wallhacks.

Installation 1, Chams -

    Extract TF2Chams.zip
    Either Follow The Directions Or Keep Read
    Move the folders to your TF Folder
    PROFIT??? 


Installation 2, The Aimbot -

    Extract Aimbot
    IGNORE SOLUTION
    Open Binary/CSSharpColorAimbot
    Open TF2
    Select hl2 as your processor
    Go into a game
    JOIN BLUE TEAM OR RED TEAM
    Configure Aimbot
    Select the color under the first color
    That is the color if you are on blue team and aiming for red! 


Haven't figured the color out for red team, you probably can easy!

    Some-what slower than other aimbots (Maybe it's my end)
