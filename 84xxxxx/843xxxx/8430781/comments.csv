,struggle903,2013-05-30T07:31Z,hi! it works well if i have camera raw 4?
,kayleighember,2013-06-04T21:35Z,"Hi, so I'm using Camera Raw 7.0, and I can't seem to get these Camera Profiles to load... any ideas? Also, I'm seeing that people are using other effects (http://vsco.co/blog/vsco-film-03-fuji-custom-camera-profiles), like ""clarity down"" and ""old lens,"" but I can't find that anywhere. Is that available in Camera Raw?"
,dptrumpeter91,2013-06-09T08:20Z,@struggle903 this is for CameraRaw 7. You should consider upgrading to a newer version of Photoshop & CameraRAW
,dptrumpeter91,2013-06-09T08:25Z,"@kayleighember hey there, hope you've figured it out by now. Sorry for the late response. CameraRAW organizes its File Names kinda funny, I still haven't figured it out quite yet. Those 'Clarity Down' and 'Old Lens' presets are in there though, as I see them on my own CameraRAW presets. As for not getting them to load there are a few places to put them whether you're on a MAC or a PC. Here's a pretty comprehensive guide to installing presets: http://www.pattibrownblog.com/how-to-install-presets/"
,dptrumpeter91,2013-06-09T08:29Z,"@kayleighember I also highly suggest using the Lightroom 4 workflow as well. Might prove to be considerably easier than messing with CameraRAW. I used to be all over CameraRAW but haven't really touched it too much since I started using Lightroom in 2010. The presets are definitely nice if you're doing specialty applications in CameraRAW though, such as 32-bit HDR tone mapping and things of that sort. "
