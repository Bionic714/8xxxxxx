The Place We Ran From is the debut album by the alternative rock/alt country supergroup Tired Pony, released on July 5, 2010.

The album grew from what was initially a solo project for Snow Patrol songwriter Gary Lightbody which rapidly became a collaboration with members of Belle and Sebastian, R.E.M., and producer Jacknife Lee joining as well as contributions from actress and singer Zooey Deschanel, guitarist M. Ward, and Tom Smith of the indie rock group Editors.

The tracks were recorded over the course of one week in January 2010, in Portland, Oregon. The album charted in over a half dozen countries.

I came upon this album quite by accident and so glad I did. What a gem.
