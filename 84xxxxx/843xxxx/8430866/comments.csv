,metalchef,2013-05-09T16:06Z,"bonethugnharmony is right...

this copy de-activates itself after 3-4 weeks --it's done this on every computer I've installed it on (installed this on at least 10 systems). 

The only real way to beat activation is with KMS emulator (which MBAM doesn't like very much).

I appreciate the upload, but this doesn't remain activated, so don't bother downloading it."
