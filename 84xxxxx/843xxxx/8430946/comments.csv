Also, I'm seeding this is real.

There is a x64 bit version that is fake. Do not download that one.

This torrent: Windows 8.1 9385 x86 is REAL.

Thanks awesomeid. 

Anybody wanna see what the build is about go to my YouTube Channel: FlippinWindows"
,eye_share,2013-05-02T22:32Z,"Downloaded the iso and burned to DVD at 4X

Installed with the key supplied and it is Pre-activated

This is the original untouched leaked x86 ISO

Took about an hour or so to download this torrent

I will seed until the cows come home or the Fat lady sings, whatever comes first...

Thanks Dude!

,bogan1986,2013-06-03T18:10Z,"I have the minimum system req for windows 8 and the customer preview edition worked like a charm, but this one doesn't. It takes about 5 minutes to shut down and working with it is a pain. After install with provided S/N (disconnected from internet) i get the ugly message in the right bottom corner saying is an evaluation copy and not activated. Someone explain."
,awesomeid,2013-06-10T10:19Z,"well,you need to connect to the internet when installing this and it's automatically activated"
