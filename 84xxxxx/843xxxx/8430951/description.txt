Notes
This is a hybrid encode from primarily the US source, but with spliced in pieces of the JPN release to cover the "edited" parts of the US. It's really hardly anything worthwhile, but gonna do it for completeness sake.
The crop/framing doesn't match at all, and the color doesn't either so I had to do some hacking.
Due to this, it won't just be the few frames that are different, it'll be full shots/scenes that will be from the JPN release. I'm using a bit of AVS color matching to better match the colors so it won't be too off.
