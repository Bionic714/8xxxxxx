Maynard Ferguson - 1964 - The New Sounds Of MF And His Orchestra (1994)

The sound was not all that new but the label was as Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra, which had just concluded a long association with Roulette, switched briefly to Cameo. The big band was still in prime form, playing both swing standards and originals with power, swing and spirit. In addition to Ferguson's screaming trumpet, altoist Lanny Morgan, Willie Maiden and Frank Vicari on tenors, baritonist Ronnie Cuber and pianist Mike Abene are heard from prominently while Abene, Maiden and Don Sebesky contribute most of the arrangements. This rare LP (which has not yet been reissued on CD) is worth the search. (AllMusic)
Well, it seems that it has been reissued (in '94), so enjoy it.
