Maynard Ferguson - 1970 - M.F. Horn 1 (2005)

Trumpeter Maynard Ferguson began his successful "comeback" (after several years of low-profile activity) with this well-received Columbia LP. Featuring his English orchestra (and such soloists as altoist Pete King and Danny Moss on tenor), Ferguson had a minor hit in "MacArthur Park," showcases some Indian musicians on "Chala Nata," and shows throughout that his mind was open toward both newer forms of jazz and pop music. It's an interesting if unessential set. (AllMusic)
