This is a sequel to "Happy Trails" from the previous season.
I'm not sure why they had to bring Roy Rogers back again,  but it
was all in fun and an excuse to have some other aging TV western 
actors including Peter Breck (pictured above with Roy) and Jock Mahoney.

Also guest starring Gary Lockwood and Michael Pataki.
