The audio on this is terrible. There is a high pitched metallic sound the whole way through. I like listening to these types of shows loud because it's singing/music and you need to pump up the volume but this was just way off. It really stopped me from enjoying the show.

Not bagging the uploader though because 90% of my t.v. downloads are ettv and i think they/you do a wonderful job.   

Cheers"
