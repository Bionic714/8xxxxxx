I had one file that finished downloading, and based on that it was amazing quality, really amazing. I just wish I could finish the download."

I honestly don't understand this situation, but it feels as though whatever was hosting this file and switched off and since no one seeded I won't be able to finish downloading until it's turned back on again.. 
I can't seed either btw, in the past 8 hours, I was only able to upload 66.4 MBs."
