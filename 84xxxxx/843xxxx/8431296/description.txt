murphy78 presents Windows 7 and Windows 8 Super AIO
This has no kb files or extra features, and is intended
for IT pros. Even without DaRT8, it wouldn't fit on a
D/L DVDR. I guess if you cut all the N versions, it might
fit, but I designed this more to be used on a USB drive.

Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset 8 included in boot options.
Features include System File Scan, Recovery, Backup restore,
Offline hotfix removal, disk cleaning and repartitioning, etc.
(Thank anarchist9027 for this AIO addition)

(R) versions denote that it is a Retail image with no gVLK set.
All versions except starter have 64-bit versions. I didn't list
them all to save space.

EI.CFG is set to Retail channel for compatability. All non-VL
will ask for key and have a skip button. ProWMC upgrade key
will not work during setup, you need to restore your activation
that you previously saved after installing or install a gVLK and
use KMS Activation.

Changes from recent Windows 8 AIO releases:
-Win7sp1 appears to install using win8's files, but vista sp2 did
not work correctly, so test this a bit on target systems before
claiming everything is ok. An example of a problem from using
win8's setup files is that it could possibly use different boot
drivers that somehow get copied over. I tested it for a few days,
but I can only do so much by myself.

This is a standalone release. This is only meant for the IT pros
to be able to have a single flash drive to install either Win7sp1
or Win8. This is not updated or altered in any way. Obviously,
Microsoft does not release a ProWMC, but I have only done the
WMC flip, I have not altered the image further. You would need to
run a /set-productkey pass or use an autounattend.xml if you want
to skip the key entry part.
