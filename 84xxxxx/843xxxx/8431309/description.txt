Bio Excerpt from All Music:

One of the biggest pop stars of the early '60s, Brenda Lee hasn't attracted as much critical respect as she deserves. She is sometimes inaccurately characterized as one of the few female teen idols. More crucially, the credit for achieving success with pop-country crossovers usually goes to Patsy Cline, although Lee's efforts in this era were arguably of equal importance. While she made few recordings of note after the mid-'60s, the best of her first decade is fine indeed, encompassing not just the pop ballads that were her biggest hits, but straight country and some surprisingly fierce rockabilly.

Lee was a child prodigy, appearing on national television by the age of ten, and making her first recordings for Decca the following year (1956). Her first few Decca singles, in fact, make a pretty fair bid for the best preteen rock & roll performances this side of Michael Jackson. "BIGELOW 6-200," "Dynamite," and "Little Jonah" are all exceptionally powerful rockabilly performances, with robust vocals and white-hot backing from the cream of Nashville's session musicians (including Owen Bradley, Grady Martin, Hank Garland, and Floyd Cramer). Lee would not have her first big hits until 1960, when she tempered the rockabilly with teen idol pop on "Sweet Nothin's," which went to the Top Five. ...

All Music Album Review:

Most of the tracks on Brenda Lee's EP Collection are duplicated on Bear Family's four-disc box set, Little Miss Dynamite, but there are a handful of rare '60s recordings for collectors. One of the notable cuts that makes its CD debut here is Lee's cover of Ernest Tubb's "Thanks a Lot" from her album Top Teen Hits. The mix of '50s and '60s recordings shows her evolution from rock & roll to adult pop, beginning with "Rock the Bop" and building toward "If You Love Me (Really Love Me)" and "Georgia on My Mind" before returning to her early rock-oriented sides toward the end of the collection. There may not be enough unique material here to justify its purchase for owners of the box set, but EP Collection offers an interesting assortment of (mostly) obscurities for anyone who owns only a greatest-hits package or two.
