Iceland: Ashcloud Apocalypse
This insightful documentary looks at one of the most volcanic regions in the world and presents a gripping analysis of Iceland's past, present and possible future volcanic activity. Weaving together rich visuals from this incredible island with the latest scientific research, the programme reveals how the country's volcanoes have already exerted a dramatic effect on the population of Europe and beyond. The documentary combines background information, CGI and interviews with scientific experts to take a fresh look at major events in the island's volcanic history, such as the poisonous sulphur dioxide haze exhaled by Laki in 1783. Fieldwork and scientific research reveal how it is possible to reconstruct past Icelandic eruptions. There is also a look at how we might predict the style and magnitude of future volcanic events and the effect that they could have on modern life.
