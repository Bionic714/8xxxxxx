
If you are using Windows 7 Starter or Home Basic Edition then you might be fed up 

because of the limitations in these Restricted Edition. You are not allowed to 

change Themes, Aero is not enabled and many more.

So, I decided to share Anytime Upgrade Keygen for Windows 7 users. Just run the 

application, then click the generate button in front o f Windows 7 Edition to which 

you want to Upgrade.



No disks, no delaysΓÇöand no leaving the house. With Windows Anytime Upgrade, you can 

upgrade to a more advanced edition of Windows 7ΓÇösay from Home Premium to UltimateΓÇö

in as little as 10 minutes. That way, you get to take advantage of extra features 

while keeping your current programs, files, and settings intact.
