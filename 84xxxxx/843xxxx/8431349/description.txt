The Vickers-Maxim Machine Gun (Osprey Weapon 25)
by Martin Pegler & Peter Dennis

DESCRIPTION:
The worldΓÇÖs first self-powered machine gun, the Maxim gun became a potent symbol of Victorian colonialism in the closing years of the 19th century. It was the brainchild of Sir Hiram Maxim, the American-born firearms inventor who founded the company bearing his name with financing from Albert Vickers, who became the companyΓÇÖs chairman; MaximΓÇÖs company was absorbed by Vickers, Sons and Company in 1897. Subsequent variants in British, German and Russian service ΓÇô the .303in Vickers (1912), 7.92mm MG 08 (1908) and 7.62mm PM M1910, respectively ΓÇô dominated both the Eastern and Western Fronts during World War I and soldiered on into World War II, while the Vickers remained in front-line British service essentially unchanged until 1968. Featuring specially commissioned full-colour artwork and written by a noted authority, this is the engaging story of the Maxim and its descendants, the innovative rapid-fire weapons that saw combat with British, German, Russian and other forces in the late Victorian era and throughout the world wars.
