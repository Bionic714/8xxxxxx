Album Review:

Picking up where the first volume left off, Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 contains Linda Ronstadt's biggest hits from the late '70s, including such songs as "It's So Easy," "Hurt So Bad," "Blue Bayou," "Back in the U.S.A.," "Poor Poor Pitiful Me," "Ooh Baby Baby," "How Do I Make You," and "Tumbling Dice." Since Ronstadt's late-'70s albums tended to be a little spotty, this is a very useful summation of their highlights.
