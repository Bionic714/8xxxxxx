* Plot :

On June 17, 1995, Daniel Lugo, a bodybuilder who works at the Sun Gym, is interrupted in mid-workout as a police raid surrounds the area. Lugo attempts to run but is eventually hit by a police car. The story then switches to months before those events.

Daniel Lugo is a schemer who tries to lure elderly Florida citizens into fake investments. After being caught, sentenced, and serving his time, he is hired by Sun Gym owner John Mese to increase membership and make the gym more fitness based. Lugo triples the gym's membership within six weeks, and as the gym grows more successful, Lugo befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal. Doorbal uses steroids to enhance his body structure, which render him impotent.

Though life is simple for both trainers, Lugo wants more money and success, as he believes his love of fitness makes him more deserving of a rich life. One day, the Sun Gym gets a new member, Victor Kershaw, a self-made businessman. Lugo begins to train Kershaw and learns about his success and earnings. Lugo soon lusts after Kershaw's lifestyle and believes Kershaw is a crook. From the guidance of motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo decides to be a "doer" (rather than the one alternative: being a "don'ter") and makes a plan to extort Kershaw for his riches by kidnapping and torturing him.

Lugo brings on Doorbal for the plan, as well as Paul Doyle, a recently released, cocaine-addicted convict who served time for robbery, who has turned to religion. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team, he soon caves in when the priest of church he frequents makes a sexual advance toward him. This "Sun Gym gang" makes a plan to kidnap Kershaw at home, which fails, but they successfully incapacitate him with a taser outside his deli. Bringing Kershaw to a small warehouse he owns (which they expect will be full of fitness equipment but is actually stocked with sex toys), the gang fakes their voices to sound Latino, but Kershaw identifies Lugo from his distinctive cologne.
