Well this one was only 3 weeks late! Dynamite's on-schedule record in 2013 is the green apple shits! I'm also not sure how much I'd categorize a pulp hero as "Sci-Fi" and "Fantasy", but whatever. At least it came out!

Hey remember at the end of Prophecy, when that thing happened to Red Sonja? And how it was going to carry over into her monthly title? Uh yeah, they're so far behind, that still hasn't happened. And now they're rebooting her book or something. Fucking Dynamite. Rumor has it they're just going to give up and merge with Dark Horse, anyway...  --STFmaryville
