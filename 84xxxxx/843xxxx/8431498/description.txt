If you know the story behind this collection of songs, put together by the very modest Phildel, then youΓÇÖll know anything can be achieved if you set your mind to it. ΓÇÿThe Disappearance Of The GirlΓÇÿ has been over four years in the making and itΓÇÖs certainly benefited from it. Hats off then to her label Decca Records for allowing the interaction between the artist and producer Ross Cullum culminating in such a wonderful collection of songs here.

The title track ΓÇÿThe Disappearance Of The GirlΓÇÿ has a laid back almost lullaby beat to it cemented by a delicately laced string arrangement. Topped by PhildelΓÇÖs unique vocals that make such lyrics ΓÇ£ΓÇªif I could persuade you ΓÇª. you know he betrays you ΓÇª this much as he saves youΓÇ£. In stark contrast ΓÇÿStorm SongΓÇÿ shunts off slowly for you at first and then picks up speed and turns into a monster of a song. She manages to show a full vocal range of her voice and far from being a banshee as mentioned. No wonder this was chosen as the lead single. The plucked notes of ΓÇÿMistakeΓÇÿ announce its beginning and without warning it steps up several gears with her voice not phased by this sudden shift. Just as your ears adjust to it so once again it returns to itΓÇÖs previously slower pace, a song that certainly grows on you.
