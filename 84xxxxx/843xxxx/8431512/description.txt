On half the tunes here, McKenna collaborates with Nashville writers she met while she was making Unglamorous. Barry Dean produces and, with the exception of "You Get a Love Song" -- a track with a big country-rock sound that feels like a radio hit, complete with a screaming guitar solo -- he keeps the sound true to McKenna's quiet muse. Guitar, mandolin, and harmony vocals give the album the feel of a living-room performance. It's full of the complex love songs and working-class vignettes that McKenna is so good at
