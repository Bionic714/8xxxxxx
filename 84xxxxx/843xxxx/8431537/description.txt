Maynard Ferguson - 1978 - Carnival (2003)

Maynard Ferguson's version of "Birdland" from this LP was a bit of a hit and he fares fairly well on "Stella by Starlight" and "Over the Rainbow," but overall this typically commercial Columbia album is of lesser interest. MF, at the height of his popularity, was clearly looking for a hit, which is why he recorded "Theme from Battlestar Galactica" and roughly half of the poppish material on this rather forgettable effort. The trumpeter/bandleader would record worse albums than this LP, but this one is weak enough. (AllMusic)
