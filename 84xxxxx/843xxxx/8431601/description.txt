Various fan-made animations of missing Doctor Who episodes that have been downloaded from YouTube. Quality is quite variable, of course. I've also included a couple of animated reconstructions (the ones where telesnaps are animated to move and talk). None of the animated episodes released on official DVDs have been included.
