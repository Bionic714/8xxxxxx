"An incredibly bold and brave film." ~ Filmmaker Michael Moore

"Truly courageous! Yoav Shamir is the Israeli Michael Moore."

"A must-see for thoughtful friends and critics of Israel."

"Critics' pick! Surprisingly funny... essential viewing!"

"The most important Jewish movie of the year."

Intent on shaking up the ultimate 'sacred cow' for Jews, Israeli director Yoav Shamir embarks on a provocative - and at time irreverent - quest to answer the question, "What is anti-Semitism today?" Does it remain a dangerous and immediate threat? Or is it a scare tactic used by right-wing Zionists to discredit their critics?

Speaking with an array of people from across the political spectrum (including the head of the Anti-Defacation League, and it's fiercest critic, author Norman Finkelstein) and traveling to places like Auschwitz (alongside Israeli school kids) and Brooklyn (to explore reports of violence against Jews), Shamir discovers the realities of anti-Semitism today. His findings are shocking, enlightening and - surprisingly - often wryly funny.

"If a guy is created only because of anti-Semitism, I'm nervous about his reports, are they accurate? He has to create a problem, because he needs a job...Clearly the ADL has been responsible in certain areas, to flare up things, as much as they've helped." ~ Rabbi Hecht, Commissioner for Human Rights, National Committee for Furtherance of Jewish Education, World HQ

"We need to play on that guilt" ~ Suzanne Prince, ADL, Los Angeles

"There's a kind of pathological narcissism, navel contemplation, when you are the richest, wealthiest, most successful ethnic group in the United States, you've got the world on a platter, and you sit around, and you're talking about anti-Semitism. It's just kind of shameful, I think." ~ Dr. Norman Finkelstein
