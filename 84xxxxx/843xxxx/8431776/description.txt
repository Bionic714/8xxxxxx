Luther DickinsonΓÇÖs acoustic instrumental being released by Songs of the South Records. "I grew up on John Fahey," says Dickinson. "Hambone's Meditations is in his Tacoma tradition, but it was Jack Rose who made me realize that the medium of instrumental guitar was there for me to utilize. It had never occurred to me to try it myself and it was a satisfying relief when I did. I write musical ideas all the time and writing this record felt as natural as breathing. This record was very timely in my life as well. My daughter was just an infant as I wrote this material and I was still meditating on my father's passing. The music fit the mood of the Mississippi winter of 2009."
