,ChingaTuu,2013-05-03T00:07Z,"...What STFM said, gesserit! Someone from Novus will no doubt post a ""Service Pack"" for this that will include the missing issue for those of us who don't have it already, and if DC and Len Wein decide to do that epilog after all, them a ""Watchmen HD Release SP2"" can also be produced and posted.

Heh, just in case, I probably should write the test plan and the test report template so that both Service Packs can properly be tested and RTPB - Release To Pirate Bay - candidates will show up as bug-free as possible...:) :) :)"
