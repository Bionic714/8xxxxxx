,reneshakil,2013-05-02T20:34Z,thank u STFmaryville
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-02T20:44Z,you're welcome! i'll be sad to see this one end. it's been great!
,binderguy1,2013-05-03T01:57Z,"Thanks for the ul!  Haven't read this series yet, so I'll give it a try.

Just one itsy bitsy question, if this series so great, how come I only see 4 torrents (2 of them by you) and not so many seeders/leechers?  ;-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T03:06Z,"dunno why you only see 4 -- there are 13 torrents on TPB? reneshakil usually uploaded it.

but yeah, although it's been great, it hasn't been selling.  :-/

the writers, abnett & lanning are fairly well-known for marvel's nova and guardians of the galaxy, and the regular artist tom derenick (who drew most of this issue, despite the description) has a great, clean style.

this is a much better legion of super-heroes (far-future, celebrity super-team) than the lsh title is!"
,reneshakil,2013-05-03T18:53Z,"@binderguy1 check again, u'll find all of them.
@STFmaryville i'm sad too. i liked this series that's why i continued to upload even no one cared to comments ab it.
oh and forget to warn u, last issue is mine. stay away from num 12:p"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T21:44Z,"sounds good to me, it's yours!

i'm going to have to find that Free Comic Book Day 2012 special issue for this series. it made me want to read it, and i'm glad that i have.

i suspect that Boom signed Dan & Andy to a 1-year contract agreement.  :-("
,reneshakil,2013-05-03T22:16Z,i didn't check inside news. but i'm looking forward to new Boom title 'Suicide Risk' by Mike Carey.
,binderguy1,2013-05-04T00:13Z,"I remember what I did wrong, I clicked on the tag(s) links and only got the specific 4 torrents.

I shoulda used the Pirate Search engine, but no, I wuz too lazy to type a few letters!  ;-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-04T12:14Z,oh yeah! i never thought of that.
