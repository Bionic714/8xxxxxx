Unpredictable Kenyan dating show in which the hosts scout the streets of Nairobi looking to match make various single people encountered on the street. The idea behind this series is that, the Host has first to pick an eligible male or female from passers-by on the street, and then with the presenters help, approach an equally eligible member of the opposite sex for a date. Once the match is made, a camera crew follows the recently introduced lovebirds around. ItΓÇÖs then back to their homes to discover what they are really like. The couple then go on the date (filmed for the viewers), reporting back on its success or failure, most especially what they really think of each other.
