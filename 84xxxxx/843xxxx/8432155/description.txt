Maynard Ferguson - 1983 - Live From San Francisco (1994)

Live from San Francisco was Maynard Ferguson's strongest jazz album in quite a few years. Utilizing a small big band comprised of 12 pieces, Ferguson is in consistently fiery form during a session recorded live at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. "Bebop Buffet" (which has quotes from many bop classics) is a high point, and these versions of "Lush Life" and "On the Sunny Side of the Street" (along with four group originals) are quite enjoyable; baritonist Denis DiBlasio's arrangements are a major asset.
