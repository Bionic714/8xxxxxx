Maynard Ferguson - 1982 - Storm (1994)

Maynard Ferguson had led many big bands before recording this Palo Alto LP. This was not one of his more significant units (few of the sidemen have been heard from much since) and the music, although more jazz-oriented than his earlier Columbia LPs (including versions of "Take the 'A' Train" and a vocal feature for MF on "As Time Goes By"), is not really that memorable. It's a lesser effort. (AllMusic)
