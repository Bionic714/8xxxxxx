,SaTaNiK1,2013-05-08T17:31Z,"""My upload speed is slow so give it some time, be patient, and SEED!

Be sure to not limit your upload speed during initial seeding so I don't have to seed much more than 100% to get the torrent self sustaining. It would help me and you out a lot."""
,animelover91,2013-05-13T17:13Z,"Thanks man your uploads are the best I always wait for your OP uploads. I will definitely be seeding after I finish with your latest OP. 

Also do u think u will/can upload Naruto and Naruto Shippuden?"
,SaTaNiK1,2013-05-15T18:43Z,Uploading Naruto and Shippuden next!
,animelover91,2013-05-16T03:59Z,"Thanks man, i haven't been able to find that many good quality ones"
,SaTaNiK1,2013-05-17T16:32Z,That's why I encoded these. All that really exist are crappy mini encodes. I can't stand those things!
,animelover91,2013-05-18T12:59Z,"true that, i have the entire bleach series and movies and it is less the 60gb. I would rather have good quality then compact size"
,ChoeyXD,2013-05-27T22:08Z,Can anyone seed the movies I'm going at 0.7 kbs
