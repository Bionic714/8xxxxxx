[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-02T20:42Z,"as far as i know, everything he converted down to tablet edition was also posted in a torrent, *or* inside one of the New 52 Week or 0-Day Week megatorrents.

so if there's anything you can't find, just reply to this and i'll link to it."
,dwm015,2013-05-02T23:40Z,"STFmaryville, Im missing Thanos Rising #2. Do you happen to have that? It is all that hasn't been uploaded for this week (5/2). Thanks in advance! Also, thanks for all that you do for the community!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T00:31Z,"you're welcome.

thanos rising #2 is a weird situation. i SWEAR someone uploaded it yesterday, because i was going to download it and post it here ... and then i saw it show up here ... and i downloaded it from here!

i can only assume the poster was banned and all his/her torrents removed? very, very strange. anyway, someone else posted it a little while ago."

Thanos #2."
,dwm015,2013-05-03T02:46Z,"Yeah, I did search for it and definitely did not find it. Thanks for the link man!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T03:41Z,"glad you'll have it, too. that mini is making thanos into the creepiest purple bastard since barney!"
,Calel1234,2013-05-03T06:39Z,"Crap. I just noticed that link I gave doesn't work. Torrent stuck at 0.0%. 

Mind uploading it, STF?  :)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T14:27Z,"not a bit. i'll have to download it again, though. (i read it and deleted it to save hd space.)"
,jrden90,2013-05-16T01:58Z,I can't find any of the early issues of Red She-hulk posted anywhere.  Would it be possible for an up-to-date torrent of this title from issue 1-current be compiled and posted?  I would greatly appreciate it.
