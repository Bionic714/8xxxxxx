Call her superficial, but Susie B Anthony Rabinowitz Gersten assumed her marriage was greatΓÇöand why not? Jonah Gersten, MD, a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, clearly adored her. He was handsome, successful, and a doting dad to their four-year-old triplets. But when Jonah is found dead in the Upper East Side apartment of second-rate ΓÇ£escortΓÇ¥ Dorinda Dillon, Susie is overwhelmed with questions left unanswered. ItΓÇÖs bad enough to know your husbandΓÇÖs been murdered, but even worse when youΓÇÖre universally pitied (and quietly mocked) because of the sleaze factor. None of it makes sense to SusieΓÇönot a sexual liaison with someone like Dorinda, not the ΓÇ£better not to discuss itΓÇ¥ response from JonahΓÇÖs partners. With help from her tough-talking, high-style grandma Ethel, who flies in from Miami, she takes on her snooty in-laws, her husbandΓÇÖs partners, the NYPD, and the DA as she tries to prove that her wonderful life with Jonah was no lie.
