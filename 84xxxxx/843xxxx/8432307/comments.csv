can you upload
IRREVERSIBLE of monica bellucci"
,jalucian,2013-05-05T08:09Z,"Already had 9 Songs in the works and I'll keep that list to work from. Thanks. Didn't find Identification of a Woman on IMDb, however. Was considering doing Gia (Unrated) and Showgirls, but pretty decent 720p's are already out there for those two. I'd also like to do the uncut version of Irréversible, but there are no 1080p or 720p sources I can get my hands on. Motorcycle Diaries 1080p, The Man Who Knew Too Much 1080p, and The Naked Gun 720p will be out next."
,jalucian,2013-05-05T08:52Z,"Also not listed on IMDb: The Image (1975) and The Demoniacs (1974),  but I grabbed sources for Jade, Color of Night, Belle de Jour and Monamour. "
,jalucian,2013-05-06T00:31Z,Vertigo is already up (you probably are aware) and The Man Who Knew Too Much will be up within 2-4 days.
,jalucian,2013-05-06T00:36Z,"Already have 3 off that last, getting 5 more. Found a couple that I didn't initially see on IMDb. The Demoniacs and The Image - getting both those as well. Thanks for the list - exactly the kind of stuff I like to do."
,jalucian,2013-05-06T12:58Z,"After watching Jade, I've decided not to do that one. For one thing, the director's cut was only released as a VHS version, but more importantly, it just doesn't have the shock value of Monamour, which I also watched and decided it to move it to the front of the list immediately. If memory serves, Indecent Proposal also wasn't quite controversial enough for my taste. Color of Night might be a little too tame as well, I'll have to review it again. I kinda hate to skip Jade since it was written by the same guy who did Basic Instinct, Sliver, and Showgirls, but it just doesn't have the shock value of Monamour or 9 Songs. Those two are definitely do's. Currently ones from your list that I already have or will be getting shortly (and will do if they're controversial enough) are: Color of Night, The Image, Belle de Jour, Identification of a Woman, Salon Kitty and The Demonaics. I've watched a little of The Image so far, and it's leaning toward a yes also. Great list - keep those suggestions and requests coming!"
,jalucian,2013-05-06T16:20Z,Oh we are so doing The Image. It's even worse than Monamour!
,onlyHD,2013-05-08T10:13Z,"Hi Jalucian,

        You are few of the uploaders, who do requests most. I hate myself to load you with huge requests. I was embarrassed after requesting this list and due to some work, i was out of home for past few days.

After making back to home now, i checked your page thinking how did you take it on this list. But you take it in such friendly manner (really surprised and can't believe you like them) and the best part of all is you expect even more from me :)

I got no words expect you are INCREDIBLE and AWESOME !!!!

Keep ROCKING  !!!
