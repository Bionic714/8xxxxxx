All of the Warmachine and Hordes books published after the Forces of books.

Includes 
Wrath and Domination - The battle engine books
Colossals and Gargantuans - They contain their namesakes

Gargantuans is a reduced version that does not contain the new rules information, just model info and fluff. 


Free the information!

This game is awesome and I fully support buying all the books and whatever models you find most appealing.
