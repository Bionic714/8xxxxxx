,anterior2dasuperior,2013-05-04T09:26Z,"I need some help!  Does anyone know who sings the version of ""Fade Into You' that is playing during episode 3 when Ernesto is saying goodbye to Katie in the garden?  It was originally done by Mazzy Star and has been covered a lot, but this version on Ready for Love sounds amazing!  I used Shazam on my TV with my Iphone and it actually gave me the result: ""Music from the show Ready for Love"" but there's no music to purchase online at iTunes or anywhere else that gives song details.  I checked YouTube and Poppy does a version that is close but that's not it.  If anyone can find it out from one of those music on tv sites or anywhere else please post it here cuz it's been killing me!  Thank you so much!  By the way, all of the new episodes of Ready for Love are now being released on NBC.com and aren't on TV anymore, but the episodes also show up On Demand for my cable service.  Thanks!"
,flowerbabie9,2013-05-05T05:34Z,"Hello there,
If anyone has access for Episode 5 (Part 2 - the continuation of episode 4), if you could please upload it? I am from Canada, and unfortunately, cannot stream from NBC, Hulu, or even purchase from amazon or itunes.
Thanks so much - hope you can keep the future episodes coming.

,flowerbabie9,2013-05-05T05:36Z,"Hello there,
Thanks so much for the upload. I was wondering if you might be able to upload Episode 5 (and future episodes)? The reason is because I am in Canada, and cannot stream directly from NBC.com, Hulu, or any of the American sites. Thanks so so much."

,flowerbabie9,2013-05-08T05:59Z,"Thanks so much, q2323! Episode 4 part 2 is playing right now - doesn't seem like tunnelbear will last long enough to play another episode (out of data/memory), so hopefully someone might be kind enough to upload Episode 5 for me :) Many thanks."
