Storyline:
Otto is working at the grocery when he loses his temper and quits.
Befriended by a Repo Man, Otto sees vehicle repossession as a kind of modern buckaneering.
He is attracted by the adventure and the 'who gives a damn' attitude of the other Repo men.
At the same time a package is taken from a government lab that has strange effects on anyone who sees it.
It is hidden in a car which the government lists for reposession with a hefty reward.
