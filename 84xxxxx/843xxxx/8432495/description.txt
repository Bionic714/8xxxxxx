Martina McBride (born July 29, 1966) is an American country music singer and songwriter. McBride has been called the Celine Dion of Country Music for her big-voiced ballads and soprano range. 

McBride was signed to RCA Records in 1991, and made her debut the following year as a neo-traditionalist country singer with the single, The Time Has Come. Over time, she developed a pop-styled crossover sound, similar to that of Faith Hill and Shania Twain, and has had a string of major hit singles on the Billboard country chart and occasionally on the adult contemporary chart. 

The Way That I Am, was the title of McBride's second album. (wikipedia)
