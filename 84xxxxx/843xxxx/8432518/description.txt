Big City was recorded in a two-day marathon recording session that produced enough songs for this release, plus HaggardΓÇÖs 1982 release, Going Where the Lonely Go. The songs continue HaggardΓÇÖs often-used themes surrounding the struggle of the working man amid the complexities and challenges of urban life. (wikipedia)
