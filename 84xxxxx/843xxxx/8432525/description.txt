Montgomery Gentry is an American country music duo composed of vocalists Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry, both natives of Kentucky. The duo is known for its Southern rock influences. Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the duo evokes the sound and spirit of Southern rockers like Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Marshall Tucker Band, and Charlie Daniels, painting themselves as rowdy redneck rebels who still hold small-town values.

You Do Your Thing, is their fourth album and has been certified platinum by the RIAA (wikipedia)
