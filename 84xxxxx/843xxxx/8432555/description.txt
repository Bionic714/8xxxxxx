tr108 had already uploaded season 1 of young justice and the first 7 episodes of season 2.  the link for season 1 is below, as I do not think that its necessary to re-upload it :)  

I was really sceptical about this show, but its actually really good! even though it has been cancelled the season finale provides enough closure, well at least I think so.  

Also, the 1st 7 episodes of this torrent are tr108's encodes so a big thank you to him!

Also, there aren't any adverts in this show rip, and most of my uploads will be advert free too

As always comment, seed and enjoy!
