Maynard Ferguson - 1989 - High Voltage 2

For a period in the mid-to-late '80s, trumpeter Maynard Ferguson broke up his usual little big band and had a funky combo, a septet with just two horns and a large rhythm section. For the second of his two High Voltage CD's, Ferguson primarily plays group originals (plus a slower-than-usual "Star Eyes") that comes across as fairly routine and predictable. There is nothing particularly memorable about this pleasant but unadventurous set of music. (AllMusic)
