Rod Steiger is ferocious as a scheming land developer in Francesco Rosi's Hands Over The City, a blistering work of social realism and the winner of the 1963 Venice Film Festival Golden Lion. This expos√© of the politically driven real estate speculation that has devastated Naple's civilian landscape moves breathlessly from a cataclysmic building collapse to the backroom negotiations of civic leaders vying for power in a city council election, laying bare the inner workings of corruption with passion and outrage.
