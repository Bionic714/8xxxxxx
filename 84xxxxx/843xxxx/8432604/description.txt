Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, May 2 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the latest efforts by the government to restrict liberty following the Boston false flag and the encouraging pushback by the American people who are resisting the move toward a police state in increasing numbers. 

He also takes a look at a Department of Homeland Security's move encouraging Floridians to spy and inform on each other. 

On today's show, David Schmecker, an honorably discharged Navy veteran with no criminal past, talks about having his gun permit revoked and his guns forcefully confiscated by police as part of a distressing move by officialdom to disarm veterans.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
