,theamdman,2013-05-06T07:12Z,"TE, is the best! I guess raid does the uploads to TPD?"
,ThatGuyWayOverThere,2013-05-06T23:06Z,"Thanks TeamExtreme! your UL's are amazing , great work!!!!"
,VStar101,2013-05-07T22:51Z,Can I use the multiplayer with people who bought the legict game?
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-05-08T02:09Z,"@killtheshit You can.

@VStar101 If there servers allow it."
,mirasxil,2013-05-11T16:21Z,"message: bad video card , what can i do ??"
,os74,2013-05-12T16:32Z,"I might be doing something wrong. I get ""Minecraft 1.5.2"" displayed in the debug info and the main menu, but the game doesn't act very 1.5.2-ey (i.e. the newer features don't seem to be in the game). Any ideas?"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-05-13T01:58Z,"@os74 There isn't any, only bug fixes and optimizations.

Please read the change logs on the launchers news."
,Beakerbee,2013-05-13T09:04Z,"Jeez, thanks!"
,os74,2013-05-13T11:44Z,"@TeamExtreme: My bad, I got confused by the snapshots. Is there a way to get those working in cracked Minecraft? I tried downloading the new launcher from Mojang, but (not surprisingly) it didn't let me log in."
,aqdv25,2013-05-14T04:43Z,Can you add mods to this torrent?
,LegoGamer,2013-05-16T02:32Z,how do you get it in premium mode?
,Grazaldt,2013-05-16T09:33Z,"Works wonderfully. Extremely quick download, no hassles in installation, official server's quite fun, has a helpful staff available most times. Just like TE has been for so long. :D Amazing, as usual."
,pacolovac,2013-05-16T20:03Z,"What happened to thepiratebay? They used to have a rating function, now it just gives another spam window when you click ""write comment"". 
And does anyone know how to fix the achievements getting reset every time I load a game?"
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-17T10:30Z,This torrent has been placed on Radical Studios with Rattle189's approval. Thank you and have a nice day.
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-05-17T13:58Z,"@xXxZombinexXx

I really don't give a sh*t about Rattle189 or his approval, he's an idiot who steals other peoples torrents.

Have a nice day."
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-19T15:49Z,"@TeamExtreme: Its not very nice to say that. He didn't steal it, and he made it by himself. If you don't believe it, don't. Just shut up and enjoy the torrent. Share share :3"
,Boldimore,2013-05-19T16:20Z,"@TeamExtreme
I am a huge fan of your guys.
I wanted to ask you if I could get permission to upload this torrent to my account, I will name you as the makers and I will provide a link to this torrent in the description.
Thanks in advance for answer!"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-05-20T02:04Z,"@xXxZombinexXx You do know the name ""Radical Studios"" is a well know AAA publishing company and has been for a long time, they have worked on movies such as Oblivion. Hell you may as well have called your self EA. 

Here at TE we create our own content instead of ripping stuff off others, Our MC launcher was self coded.

Like I said Rattle189 is an idiot. Have a nice day.


@Boldimore We really don't like people reposing our torrents on TPB because it splits up the seeding pool but if you want to upload it, I would recommend maybe adding a few mods and changing the title to that show it's a little different. 

Thank you for asking,  much appreciated."
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-20T06:17Z,@TeamExtreme: Don't you mean Radical Studios PH? Or RD Studios PH from WVSU? No? Okay. Have a nice day.
,PsYched.RoNNie,2013-05-20T16:26Z,****Do you need a premium account to connect in teamextreamserver ?? please HELP!!!****
,Boldimore,2013-05-20T17:12Z,"@PsYched.RoNNie, no you don't need a premium account."
,Boldimore,2013-05-20T17:13Z,"@TeamExtreme

,UberUltimate,2013-05-31T18:25Z,1.5.2 is fucking awesome!
,DannyJoe,2013-06-02T10:15Z,"I can see relate to pirating games from a multimillionaire company, but you should feel ashamed if you can't support independent game developers, its $25 and its worth it."
,Kurius_,2013-06-02T19:38Z,"Wondering if anyone else has a problem with reappearing blocks? Anyone know a way to fix this? 

Besides the blocks reappearing on me this is an awesome torrent, thank you TeamExtreme"
,TEH_UPLOADER,2013-06-05T15:13Z,"i bought it for 10€ but now i need a test accunt for my server, and i realy dont want to buy the game a second time for 25€ ._."
,Bloody_stone,2013-06-08T20:24Z,Thx
,Writer223,2013-06-09T10:10Z,"it works perfectly. :D but if anyone wants to make their own server this is what you need to do, just remove the spaces between the link.
"
[T],TeamExtreme,2013-06-09T16:19Z,"@DannyJoe You are an idiot.

Mojang have sold almost 11 million copy's of Minecraft on the PC alone, that's not even counting xBox or IOS...

Do some simple math and you will see there small team have made over 300 million dollars easily."
,xxtoolheadxx,2013-06-10T06:43Z,"Glitchy, doesnt work right. Win 8- 8Gb Ram nice custom build computer. Just glitches out.. Hopefully get fixed thank you"
