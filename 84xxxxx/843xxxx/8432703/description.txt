What's cool about it:
A gripping spy-themed storyline that will keep you entertained for over 60 hours
A great adventure gameplay with a mix of stealth, survival and action
An unusual example of adding a movie-like field to the game without sacrificing the game
Overview:
You are John Cord, an MI6 Secret Service agent who has been sent to Vologia, USSR, at the request of CIA, to help track down a missing agent. Captured by Nagarov forces, you are alone in a hostile country. You must escape, infiltrate, sneak and shoot your way through increasingly dangerous locations. Find out who betrayed you and get closer to the ruthless mastermind behind the plan to trigger a nuclear holocaust!

Enter the world of espionage and conspiracy in which intelligence and self control will be your only way out. Stealth or brute force... The choice is yours!
