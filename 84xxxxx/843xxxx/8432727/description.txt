What's cool about it:
Vast, open world to explore, much bigger than in the series' previous installments.
Non-linear story and sandbox-type gameplay create a really powerful feeling of freedom.
Atmospheric music and beautiful graphics work together to create many breathtaking scenes.
Overview:
Orcs have enslaved the human race. You are one of the more fortunate ones, still free to roam Myrtana. Freedom affords you the option to stay true to the throne of the deposed human king, serve the Orcish usurpers, or carve your own path. Every decision made will have an impact on the fate of humanity and the balance of power. The choice is yours to make and will influence all those living in the shadow of the Orcs.

Gothic 3 is as non-linear as an RPG can get without losing a sense of purpose. Its huge, living world holds many treasures, breathtaking locations, and dark secrets. It is a giant playground in which you have total freedom. Gothic 3 suffered from a rocky start due to some bugs initially after launch. This version of the game, however, is patched and updated and offers a vastly smoother experience that makes it much easier for you to get drawn into the engaging world and its many plots.
