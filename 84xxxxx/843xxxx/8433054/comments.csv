,MikeXRyan,2013-05-06T07:46Z,"This is a great new ""classic"" British comedy, sure to be picked up by PBS.  Great cast.  Fine acting.  I laughed and laughed and hope it runs for years.

Originally aired on April 29th.  Next airing should be May 6th (Monday).  Look for episode 2 then.  It is getting great reviews from viewers and critics.  A very gay comedy and fits in with today's sitcoms nicely.

(I ask myself, why doesn't America come up with a great openly gay series like this?  Answer: 50% of Americans are brainwashed by their own bigoted religions and those religions are determined to keep gay people in the closet - not to be heard or seen by their children.  Very sick and very stupid.)"
