First biography paragraph from All Music (by Jason Ankeny):

The most commercially successful female singer in British chart history, Petula Clark was born November 15, 1932 in Epsom, England. Trained to sing by her soprano mother, Clark embarked on a stage career at the age of seven; soon she was a fixture on British radio programs, and began hosting her own regular show, Pet's Parlour -- a series spotlighting patriotic songs designed to boost the morale of wartime audiences -- at the tender age of 11.

All Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):

The second Vogue Records anthology of Petula Clark's early 1960s French output is very different from its companion. On these 23 songs, Clark aims for a much more sophisticated sound, avoiding covers of American rock & roll in favor of homegrown French repertory. This is where her exquisitely sensual rendition of Sidney Bechet's "Petite Fleur" was cut, and it's only one in a string of finely cut musical jewels. The mood is cool and sophisticated throughout, as Clark proves herself a singer of superb control and delicacy, in settings that mix tasteful pop strings and light jazz -- she used to cite Peggy Lee and Ella Fitzgerald as major influences on her musical sensibilities, and this is the collection where that becomes clear, although the influence of Edith Piaf and other French singing icons is also evident.
