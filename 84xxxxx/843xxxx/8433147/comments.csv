[T],SCSA420,2013-05-04T09:41Z,CINAVIA content protection detected on LG BP620 3D BluRay player from USB and DVD +R DL disc and it stopped the audio playback. I had to use my Panasonic DMP-BD75 BluRay player (Cinavia Free) to play the file without playback problems. The quality is great but be just be aware that it does have Cinavia on it.
,pr0xZen,2013-05-06T03:01Z,"topk: I seriously hope you're kidding or trolling. The reason most 720p movies are not 1280x720 res, is because most movies the last 5-10 years are shot in a wider aspect than 1:1,78. They are, rather shot in 1:2,35 or 1:2,40. Wich means a resolution (in 720p standard - wich is defined by horizontal 1280p, not vertical 720p) is closer to ~533 or ~544 respectively. If you've been to the movies a few times the last decade, you'd notice this.

For you to get a 1280x720 picture of this, you would either have to: 1 - cut away alot of the picture on the sides, missing out on alot. 2 - stretch the image vertically, it would look aweful. or 3 - add black bars on the top and bottom of the image, just to fill the blanks. That would make the file alot bigger but the actual picture the same size - and makes no sense in doing. Your TV already fills in those areas with black bars, no need to add them just for a larger file size (wich we try to avoid).

Either blame the film industry for not filming in a different aspect, or get a 21:9 TV. Don't blame the encoders for the choices the movie industry makes."
,topk,2013-05-07T02:20Z,"@proxzen, I understand, you're right on this, but my main beef is with the lemmings going for the shitty small size rips

I love BOZX because he doesn't save on file size/quality of the rip. Now that I got a unlimited download for just extra 10$/month I am only downloading the biggest size/best quality rips and I hope people start speaking up and protest this download cap bullshit.

You're cheating yourself out of the entire intended experience by going for a shitty compressed rip of a HD movie"
,topk,2013-05-07T02:22Z,"Get yourself a cheap universal media player like WDTV or even just connect to your TV via HDMI and watch on the big screen and you'll realize what you've been missing out on!... Stop downloading shitty small size rips and go for the largest size! But first, COMPLAIN ABOUT DOWNLOAD CAPS"
,topk,2013-05-07T02:24Z,And another thing that really kills my butt is this retarded tpb comments system! You post a comment and then you have to reload forty times or wait who knows how long to be able to see your comment... or post another comment
,legio9,2013-05-18T22:28Z,"the TOP quality uploader BOZX does it again!

Perfect copy, as usual!

Thanks mate!"
,BIueShark,2013-06-03T01:47Z,@topk I especially hate how some uploaders do 720p or 1080p with friggin stereo sound. What the fuck is wrong with them?
