I used abbyy finereader to rip kaiser's double-paged copy in half, to make it more readable on a tablet screen.

It made numerous small glitches, throwing in odd letters between sentences and screwing up margins, line breaks, etc. but is still very readable.

It ain't perfect and purdy, but text is way bigger than what I started with now, so don't bitch and moan.

I made an editable word copy too, for anyone who wants to go through the tedium of editing all into perfect order. As far as I can tell, nothing is missing...just have to weed out lots of small glitches.

Enjoy!
