,Phatfish,2013-05-05T18:20Z,"You have to take a lot of acid before this start looking like a BRRip.

I don't know what the fuck is goin on with the scene. The picture is so bad that I want to believe there is something wrong with my computer.

First time ever I download a straight out shitty scen4all torrent."

Good quality movie apart from Cinavia protection.  Story is a normal action movie.  Not too bad but don't expect something groundbreaking.  Worth a watch if you're bored."

,Klee63,2013-05-22T08:02Z,"Another good violent movie from Jason Statham to be expected. The violence he inflicts sends the women who see him doing it swooning as per usual. Worth the download for seeing the fights but bald short men don't push my buttons, even rich ones. "

,Masta-Ro,2013-06-01T07:38Z,"Good Quality. Appreciate the effort.  I'm a Statham fan since LSTSB, but this was a stinky turd.  I couldn't finish it.  Film had a major identity crisis.  Terrible dialogue.  The Parker character was not developed enough for me to give a shit.  Just an ackward feeling movie.  "
