This feature will allow you to stream converted videos directly from DVD or Blu-ray discs. This will not require intermediate conversion and it will be much easier to watch video files on your favorite player.

There is no doubt that MKV format brings a lot of great features and advantages. To exploit this we can recommend MakeMKV and similar applications. Since Matroska is a container file format it will allow you to put more than one video, subtitle, information’s and audio file into one container and one file. You can pack everything in only one file which significantly simplifies everything.

Key features of MakeMKV:
- Reads DVD and Blu-ray discs
- Reads Blu-ray discs protected with latest versions of AACS and BD+
- Preserves all video and audio tracks, including HD audio
- Preserves chapters information
- Preserves all meta-information (track language, audio type)
- Fast conversion – converts as fast as your drive can read data.
- No additional software is required for conversion or decryption.
- Functionality to open DVD discs is free and will always stay free"
