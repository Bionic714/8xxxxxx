While working in his grandfather's antique shop, Tommy Preston finds the Aztec "Heart of Gold," an artifact empowered by ΓÇ£the blood of a thousand martyred Aztecs.ΓÇ¥ The object gives ΓÇ£strength and courageΓÇ¥ to those pure of heart and devoted to justice. Tommy only has to utter the words ΓÇ£Heart of GoldΓÇ¥ and gain his powers of super strength, flight and high voltage vision (x-ray vision). The heart's magic also keeps Tommy from being recognized while he is in Golden Lad form. Later on, Tommy is helped by partner named Golden Girl.
