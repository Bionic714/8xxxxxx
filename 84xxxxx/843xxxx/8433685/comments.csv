DONT HAVE TO START OVER AGAIN IF YOU WERE GETTING IT ALREADY

You can just delete the banned episodes folder so its like you never downloaded that folder and then redownload the new torrent while keeping the same files you already have and then have it do a file re-check with your torrent client and you will resume where you left off minus the banned episodes of course. Then it will be like you never stopped downloading and you will get the corrected banned episodes like it was the same torrent."
