Look, itΓÇÖs really really rare that I fall stupid in love with an album. It probably comes down to the fact that I just might hear more new music in a week than most people do in 6 months, but the point is, I can get pretty jaded. That said, Otis GibbΓÇÖs new album, Joe HillΓÇÖs Ashes, walked into my head, didnΓÇÖt say a single word and whooped my blogger jadedness and said ΓÇ£You will love me now!ΓÇ¥ And love it then, I did.

When I wrote about OtisΓÇÖ last album, When Grandpa Walked A Picket Line, I said, ΓÇ£if Todd Snider and Otis Gibbs could make a baby it would be the Woody Guthrie, Hunter S. Thompson and the Jack Kerouac of its generation.ΓÇ¥ At the time I was pointing towards OtisΓÇÖ political leanings and ToddΓÇÖs wit. Joe HillΓÇÖs Ashes has treated me to a brand new appreciation for OtisΓÇÖ pure songwriting ability. That coupled with his voice, a voice that invites you into its sunny 78 degree porch for Old Fashioneds and asks you to stay and spin yarns, makes this an album that immediately feels comfortable. As awesome as that is, had this been the first Otis Smith Gibbs album IΓÇÖd ever heard, IΓÇÖd have been more apt to juxtapose him with Seasick Steve.

Okay, IΓÇÖm gonna gonna go old school with yΓÇÖall. If you were reading this site back in 2k7 you were really well versed in my midnight drunken ramblings sans an editor or a sober eye prior to posting so you should be (albeit: rusty) used to thisΓÇªThis album is fucking fantastic. I wanna be more ΓÇ£professionalΓÇ¥ about it, but I canΓÇÖt. ItΓÇÖs stupid how good it is. If I were still getting a regular paycheck that allowed me to go to bars, IΓÇÖd be passing CD-RΓÇÖs (yes, I do that) of this album out to people, saying, ΓÇ£This album is by a guy called Otis Gibbs and itΓÇÖs fucking fantastic!.ΓÇ¥ If they asked what it sounded like IΓÇÖd say, ΓÇ£Go home and listen to it, if you like it IΓÇÖll pass along similar artists.ΓÇ¥

So, Otis Gibbs ΓÇô Joe HillΓÇÖs Ashes. Fucking fantastic. Essential Listening.
