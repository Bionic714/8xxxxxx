Northern Ireland: home to Snow Patrol, RihannaΓÇÖs boob-based farm scandal, and what was, for 30 years until 1998, BritainΓÇÖs only fully functioning civil war. What the country really isnΓÇÖt famed for, though, is art-rock bands. YΓÇÖsee, art-rock just doesnΓÇÖt fly in this crunch-punk-loving province. And with their affectless post-punk and brittle C86 pop, Girls Names are about as quintessentially ΓÇÿNorthern IrishΓÇÖ as an Argentinian horse.

But listen as their debut unfolds, and youΓÇÖll see ΓÇô in their menacing beauty and dread stillness ΓÇô a band whose dark disposition has everything to do with Northern Ireland.

Since the ceasefire, a new breed of artists have rejected the Ash-helmed grunge era in favour of a less simplistic vernacular better able to capture an emotionally damaged country as it heals. If noise-lords LaFaro are Belfastian defiance incarnate, and Two Door the gleaming face of The New Northern Ireland, then Girls Names are the countryΓÇÖs troubled heart. ΓÇÿThe New LifeΓÇÖ is the very sound of being haunted by your past, tapping into the angst of a population struggling to move on. ΓÇ£How can we ever begin...ΓÇ¥ sings Cathal Cully on the title track, ΓÇ£...born to the bomb?ΓÇ¥

ΓÇÿThe New LifeΓÇÖ charts the bandΓÇÖs expansion from macabre garage rockers to full-blown goth act. Draped in CullyΓÇÖs spectral baritone, "Drawing Lines" is The Wipers reduced to an ominous shimmer, while "A Second Skin" pits vampiric downstrokes against terror-speeding arpeggios. ItΓÇÖs their death-obsessed garage rock writ panoramic ΓÇô the sound inching on "Hypnotic Regression" towards the bombast of mid-ΓÇÖ80s stadium goth. Crucially, though, they never concede to caricature. ThatΓÇÖs because ΓÇÿThe New LifeΓÇÖ is about real life, laid bare. Austere and mistrusting of dark fairy tales, this is goth with a post-punk soul.

Songs persistently subvert fancy in the name of realism. On "Notion", atonal notes and dark FX embitter the sweet C86 melodies, while the remorseless synth-whirr of "Occultation" undercuts a resemblance to The CureΓÇÖs grandiose "Disintegration". And rather than a ΓÇÿsoaring finaleΓÇÖ, the eight-minute closer simply glares atop an unchanging guitar line. The title implies a yearning for better times, but if Girls NamesΓÇÖ cinematic sweep has a romantic quality, more often than not they use bigness to dwarf CullyΓÇÖs voice against giant, lonely vistas.

ΓÇÿThe New LifeΓÇÖ is a must-listen. Not only for its seductive power, but because it feels unprecedented. Never before now have the doomy stylings of post-punk been used in the context of Northern Ireland. ΓÇÿThe New LifeΓÇÖ sounds like a gag loosened, a voice finally unsilenced.
