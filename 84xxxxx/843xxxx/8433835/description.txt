MathType is a powerful interactive equation editor that lets you create mathematical notation for word processing, Web pages, desktop publishing, presentations, and for TeX, LaTeX, and MathML documents.

Works with Many Applications and Websites

* Apple iWork '09: MathType lets you add equations to 
  documents, presentations, and spreadsheets in Pages, 
  Numbers, and Keynote.

* Microsoft Office 2008 and 2011: MathType lets you add
  equations to documents, presentations, and spreadsheets in 
  Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

* Apple iBooks Author: Add and edit equations in the ebooks
  you are authoring and make the math accessible to people with 
  visual disabilities.

* Many Other Applications and Websites: MathType also
   works with over 600 applications and websites, including:

- Yahoo Mail, Gmail, Hotmail, Mac Mail, Microsoft Outlook
- Mathematica, Maple
- InDesign, QuarkXpress
- Blackboard, Moodle, WebAssign
- Wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha
- Evernote

* Many Ways to Work: MathType can add equations to virtually 
  any application or website into which you can paste or drag a 
  graphic in PDF, EPS, or GIF format or in LaTeX or MathML
  math languages. Check our Works With section for details on 
  how MathType works with your favorite apps and websites.

More Symbols, Templates, and Fonts

* More Fonts: MathType has hundreds more symbols and 
  templates than Equation Editor. Besides our exclusive Euclid
  math fonts, you can also make use of the 1000s of math 
  symbols in fonts already on your computer, as well as math
  fonts you can download from the Internet.

* Find Symbols: MathType's Insert Symbol dialog allows you 
  to explore the available symbols and insert them with a click or
  keystroke.

Three Ways to Create Equations

* Point-and-Click Editing with Automatic Formatting: Equations 
  can be created quickly by choosing templates from MathType's 
  palettes and typing into their empty slots. MathType applies 
  mathematical spacing rules automatically as you type.

* Type TeX or LaTeX: If you already know the TeX typesetting 
  language, you can type it into the MathType window or 
  directly into a Word document. TeX editing can be mixed with
   point-and-click editing so you get the best of both worlds. 
  You can also paste in equations from existing TeX documents.

* Type TeX or LaTeX directly into a Microsoft Word document: 
  With MathType's unique TeX Toggle feature, you can type 
  TeX directly into a Word document. When you are done, use 
  the TeX Toggle command to turn it into a typeset equation. If
  you want to edit it later, use TeX Toggle again to turn it back 
  into TeX to make your changes.

Saves Time

* Save Expressions in the Toolbar: Drag frequently used 
  equations and expressions to the MathType toolbar so they can
  be inserted later with just a click or a keystroke.

* Keyboard Shortcuts: MathType has customizable keyboard 
 shortcuts for virtually every symbol, template, and command.

Easier to Use

* Toolbar and Menu in Microsoft Word 2011: MathType adds a 
  toolbar and menu to Microsoft Word 2011, allowing quick 
  access to its features and powerful commands to do equation 
  numbering, produce great-looking math web pages, and much 
  more. MathType also works with Word 2008 but lacks the   
  toolbar and menu support.

Better Results

* Color: Coloring an equation can make it stand out. Use color
  to highlight part of an equation and focus your students' 
  attention on it. Show what changed in each step of a multi-step 
  procedure.
