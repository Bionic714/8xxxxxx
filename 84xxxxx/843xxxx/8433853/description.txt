Maynard Ferguson - 1990 - Big Bop Nouveau

Maynard Ferguson broke up his funk combo High Voltage around this time and put together a 15-piece straightahead group that emphasized swinging and big band-oriented charts. Although there is a throwaway "Maynard Ferguson Hit Medley," such pieces as "Blue Birdland," "Cherokee" and "But Beautiful" better showcase the remarkable trumpeter. The sidemen include Christopher Hollyday on alto. This is an excellent all-round showcase for MF but the CD from the now-defunct Intima label will be hard to find. (AllMusic)
