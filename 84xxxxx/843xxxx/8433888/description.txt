David Sedaris - Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls [2013]

From the unique perspective of David Sedaris comes a new book of essays taking his readers on a bizarre and stimulating world tour. From the perils of French dentistry to the eating habits of the Australian kookaburra, from the squat-style toilets of Beijing to the particular wilderness of a North Carolina Costco, we learn about the absurdity and delight of a curious traveler's experiences. Whether railing against the habits of litterers in the English countryside or marveling over a disembodied human arm in a taxidermist's shop, Sedaris takes us on side-splitting adventures that are not to be forgotten.


"Sedaris is a remarkably skilled storyteller and savvy essayist. He weaves together vivid images and sensations into a coherent whole that packs a serious emotional punch....Yes, David Sedaris is really that good. And based, on this latest collection, he's getting only better." 
---Heather Havrilesky, Los Angeles Times

"Artfully milked embarrassing personal incidents for literary laughs...There are plenty of well-cut gems, including one about an ill-fated adoption of some sea turtles that's both hilarious and touching." 
---Thom Geier, Entertainment Weekly

"Fresh....funny, whimsical, unexpected, and never obvious....Who would anticipate that an encounter with an Australian bird could be so damn touching?" 
---Sherryl Connelly, New York Daily News

"A find for the reader who appreciates a sense of humor....Sedaris, like the great humorists before him, hits a nerve with his wit, which brings the reader into intimate contact with the human condition." 
---John Henry, Fort Worth Star-Telegram

"America's favorite amusing essayist....Sedaris is so gut-bustingly funny and observant that everyone should give his personal essays a read, at least once." 
---Kate Erbland, MSN

"An acute observer and master of the quick, excoriating takedown, Sedaris claims new territory in this exceptionally gutsy and unnerving collection." 
---Donna Seamn, Booklist (Donna Seamn, Booklist )
