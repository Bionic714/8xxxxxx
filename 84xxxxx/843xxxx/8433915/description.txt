Maynard Ferguson - 1995 - Live at the Great American Music Hall 1973

I hate to write my own descriptions, you'll understand why after reading it:
A good '73 concert, released in two parts. Would've been better without the introduction on every track, in my opinion, but I guess I wasn't there. Still a highly enjoyable listening.

Track list:
Part 1
01 - Mother
02 - El Dopa
03 - Blue Birdland
04 - Maria
05 - Nice And Juicy
06 - 'Round About Midnight
07 - The Foxhunt
Part 2
01 - Macarthur Park
02 - Blue Birdland
03 - Blue Birdland (2)
04 - Take The 'A' Train
05 - All Right, Allright
06 - Country Road
07 - Hey Jude

Split with Medieval. Sorry.
Enjoy and share!
