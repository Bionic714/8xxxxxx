Seriously, not to sound like a turd, but that's your best option. You will save loads of time not having to wait for someone else to make the AVI. You will save loads of bandwidth getting the smaller x264 version. Trust me. The AVI version, if it does come around, will be twice the size. Would you rather download 2.7 GB or 5 GB?  Should be obvious...

Please, people, PLEASE, try to learn to convert formats for yourselves if you still rely on the old XviD format.

It's been almost 2 years since x264 started floating around regularly.  We see no reason to continue needing XviD. It doesn't take a high power multi hundred dollar piece of equipment to play x264 files. You can pick up a HDTV Media Player for ~30$ and it will play ALL common formats: mp4, mkv, mov, mpg, avi, mp3, wav, aac, etc. from a thumb drive (USB stick)."
