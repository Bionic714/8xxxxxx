,andyfukinj,2013-05-04T05:01Z,"topk & mgman771, stop your bullshit right now. What the fuck are you talking about ? YIFY doesn't upload crap, their stuff is usually the best out there. I know you got to try to hype your loser-ass website with the link, but you are both so full of shit it's ridiculous. Anyone who's ever downloaded YIFY stuff knows it's clean as hell. Try the 1080 file before you start running your stupid mouth. Not everybody has broadband/ DSL /whatever , the reason they post the lower-quality, small size torrent. You really piss me off with your ignorant statement about "" flooding the HD section""... Yeah flooding it with decent material instead of some jerk-off at the movies recording it with a camera... probably no cam recordings at your shit-ass torrent site. Go suck each other off you dumb fuckwads."
,Bloooddrunk,2013-05-04T05:46Z,"Please help me! 
VLC won't let me run this movie! This is the first in hundreds of times that something like this happens to me!

I'm not a noob, by the way, don't treat me like one! This is serious shit!"
,buenio,2013-05-04T05:50Z,Yify's upload is not crap and nice quality for the size  but the downside is yify's 1080p are more likely and slightly better to 480p when it comes to true bluray quality! but as I said his uploads are not crap.
,tall70,2013-05-04T06:36Z,"@ Bloooddrunk, maybe it came corrupted. It's little, just get it again and see.

First i was like no on 870 Mb, but man screens looks so good on this size. THanks."
,XenonKilla,2013-05-04T07:22Z,"Damn YIFY you have a bad day or something? First I downloaded the 1080p version that has a bad audio track. Now this version is cropped to shit. lol

,topshotta4200,2013-05-04T09:46Z,"To everyone bitching about or defending yify's rips as with pretty much every yify rip nowadays.  BOTH are right, first of all just because the resolution is 720 or 1080 doesn't necessarily mean the quality is good.  Hence why we now have 720p cams, which are garbage.  I can spin around in a circle with my cell phone taking a 1080p video and it will look like trash.  The bottom line is YIFY rips are decent  but only for the size.  I wouldnt consider them close to full HD.  If you can't tell the difference them you need glasses.  YIFY's small sizes comes from lower bitrates and lower audio quality, ie. its not 5.1.  Therefor fast moving scenes are far inferior to full HD as well as very detailed scenes.  Pixels in a large detailed scene can clearly be seen in YIFY rips.  Lastly why people get so pissed off is because so many people cant really tell the difference therefore true HD content lacks the seeders they deserve.  To the people that think YIFY's releases are flawless if you saw and heard a rip side by side with a blueray you would easily see how inferior they are.  Then again some people just don't need such detailed rips hance why I'm here, still way better than the dvdrip days!"

,RafVne2,2013-05-04T11:31Z,"@topk
Yify's group encoding guys get an AMAZING Quality for such a small file size.
if you want get 1080p release. A bit bigger size, but that is almost perfect quality.

For me personally I always go with 720p and is good enough for moi'. Unless a movie itself calls for it. (you know some great sfx etc.)

YIFY uploads are really gr8 cosidering their small size..........

Not suitable for large HDTVs."""
