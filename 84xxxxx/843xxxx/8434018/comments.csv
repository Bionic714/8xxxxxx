,gmvilela,2013-05-03T10:49Z,"Oh, man, I forgot to add New World Order. I'll make a torrent for it when I come home later today. Sorry."
,gmvilela,2013-05-03T10:51Z,"Though now that I see it, New World Order isn't a part of the Supreme Power storyline of the 2000s. I'll still make a torrent for it later today."
