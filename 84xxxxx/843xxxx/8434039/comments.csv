,Mahaloth,2013-05-04T19:42Z,"I get the same error as Ehsan_danger4 and I have updated to 1.03. No fix there. 

Anyone know how to fix this?"
,miked2138,2013-05-08T23:31Z," odd game indeed, this update fixed all my problems,, if it didn't fix yours, try 1.04 that seemed to fix several people. oddly enough 1.04 made my game not even load but this one worked great.,, 
 thx gh0st"
