""Psychoblast is set around two people who share a tragic past. Taryn St. Jude and Brian Burke both experienced the deaths of their families in the same airplane crash. Now, when Brian sleeps he his consciousness is transformed into a nearly all-powerful entity known as Psychoblast. Taryn was hired to locate Brian, but in doing so becomes drawn into his world. And once she has located him, it seems everyone—from a rich schizophrenic named D.S.X. Machina to a would-be dictator called Colonel Blicero—is after him and the powers his mind possesses."""
