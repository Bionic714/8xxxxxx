Next up, our FCUP series is 'Psychoblast'. It was written by Steven Grant and illustrated by Robb Phipps. It's about a dude with telekinetic powers. If that sounds underwhelming, blame it on the internet. I searched high and low just to find out that much!


Each of my First Comics uploads contains a .txt file called 'First Missing'. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!

Thank you creators and scanners! Get it, seed it!
