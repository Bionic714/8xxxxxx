,Assassin31,2013-05-08T13:51Z,It has Virus in its Start8 activator patch buddy
,trzrj,2013-05-12T10:07Z,"Microsoft Securities Essentials, on Win 7, found no virus. Assassin31, most likely a false positive from your Anti-virus program."
,Jenson100,2013-05-12T20:44Z,It is a false positive as trzrj said.Most software cracks come up as a virus but there are clean.

One does not simply use a patch and complain about virus."
