All mods are renamed according to guide."
,emolol,2013-05-03T20:04Z,"Please note! Install only using STEP original guide. Some of the mods require BCF files wich you have to make manually (in this pack there are, however, BCF`s from STEP installation guide)"

,emolol,2013-05-10T18:56Z,yes
,Valamyr82,2013-05-11T16:41Z,"This is pretty cool of you. Thumbs up.

What would be even cooler is a pre-packaged patched and STEPed Skyrim torrent tho I realize that'd be a bit more work, it would make an amazing base install."
,redrice,2013-05-12T15:25Z,Are the textures 1024*1024 or 2048*2048?
,redrice,2013-05-12T15:47Z,Nevermind. Found out those were the lite textures.
,emolol,2013-05-12T16:08Z,"All mods are chosen according to this guide http://wiki.step-project.com/STEP:2.2.5

Check ""Baseline"" column"
,redrice,2013-05-12T17:26Z,And all you have to do is overwrite everything in the Skyrim Mods folder and install using Wrye Bash right?
,emolol,2013-05-12T23:19Z,"Not really, there is few mods that require some tweaking (create BFC for them). You have to do this manually, check guide"
,redrice,2013-05-13T21:22Z,OK figured it out. Keep uploading these:)
,emolol,2013-05-13T23:36Z,good to hear
,djnforce9,2013-06-11T14:54Z,"It normally takes an UNGODLY amount of time to gather these mods and assemble them into STEP so it's really nice to find it all nicely assembled into a single package. Can't be done on the official channels since they are too concerned that one of the mod's authors will complain or something. 

Anyway, going to wait until a Step 2.5.6 bundle is assembled since they seemed to make some rather noteworthy changes."
