,Synthesist,2013-05-03T19:49Z,I don't get it.  Why are these archive issues upped one at a time.  Why not a package all at once.
,Synthesist,2013-05-03T19:59Z,"Thanks, curious as to why these archive issues are being released one at a time.  Wouldn't a package of issues be easier?"

[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T21:52Z,"they're new high-resolution scans, and DobisP.R. is releasing a few each week, and blackcanary posts them as DobisP.R. releases them.

if you look at blackcanary's uploads, you'll see that she does package scans as a set when it's appropriate. (spider-man chapter one, legion of super-heroes, etc.)"
[V],blackcanary,2013-05-04T01:14Z,"Synthesist, like STFmaryville said, I upload them as DobisP.R. releases them.  I'll usually upload a pack that either covers an entire run, a story arc, or something appropriate.  Hope you're enjoying these. :)"
