[V],J.R.Dobbs,2013-05-03T22:12Z,i made a mistake in my Notes. There are actually no spoken words missing before audio begins. It starts during opening credits. i also made sure it was in sync all the way through to the end :)
,augypimp1,2013-05-04T10:35Z,does anybody know how this looks whats the a/v on it please reply
,NoN-D,2013-05-04T11:38Z,"Out of sink the whole movie by about 15-30 seconds. 
Unlike what uploader says. If your gonna go to all this effort at least do it right :(
If it was in sync it would be a decent cam"
[V],J.R.Dobbs,2013-05-04T18:39Z,"@NoN-D I've watched it all the way through twice, and it is in sync. Maybe you are referring to a different torrent or maybe it is the player you used. I just checked it again on both VLC and Windows Media Players, and it is definitely in sync!!"
,ScottyD7421,2013-05-05T03:25Z,"Thanks for uploading J.R.Dobbs, much appreciated.

V/7
A/7

Video is pretty good for a standard cam in that the picture is clear although dark scenes are very dark. As stated there is a flicker which some may find too much to watch.

Audio is good as well for a standard cam. I found no syncing issues at all unlike @NoN-D and could for the most part understand what they were saying. 

All in all i would say definitely download if you just have to see this movie or else wait for dvd/blu-ray.

Cheers"
,bast0573,2013-05-05T06:03Z,Definitely out of sync. Probably the worst sync jobs I've ever seen in my life!!! about 30-45 seconds off!! Tried Windows media player and my Xbox 360.
,pink50,2013-05-05T08:21Z,"yawn,boring movie...almost fell asleep"
,NoN-D,2013-05-05T12:28Z,"I must apologize, It was out of Sync on Win-Media Player, Gom Player, Real Player, Utorrent Player but In sync in Media Player Classic and VLC, 

Good Cam Rip too, 
Audio/Video both 7-8 for a Cam :)

Once again, sorry Dobbs!"
