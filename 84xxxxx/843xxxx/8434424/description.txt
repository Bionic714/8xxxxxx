NOTES
This is really decent for a cam, so don't be put off by the issues listed.
The audio is missing from the first 28 seconds, but there is only like
one spoken word during that time which is easy to figure out. And
TommieCook says about a 1:30 missing from video. Also there is a slight
flicker throughout. The audio is really good for a cam, converted it and
synced back up to video nicely. Definitely a watchable cam :D

Two samples included. Enjoy!
