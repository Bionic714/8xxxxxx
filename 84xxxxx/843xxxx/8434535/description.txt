2013 live release from the Hard Rock heavyweights. Whitesnake, the legendary Rock 'n' Roll legacy founded and formed by renowned singer/songwriter David Coverdale, released their latest studio album, Forevermore, in March 2011. Then they embarked in a world tour which touched North America, Europe and finally Japan where they had the highlight performance at the Loud Park Festival on October 15th 2011. That special night in front of thousands of fans has been captured for this unique live release where the band shines, no holds barred, with one of their most heartfelt, melodic and musically muscular performances in many a year.
