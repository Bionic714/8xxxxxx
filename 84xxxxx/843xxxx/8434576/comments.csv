I can't help you."
,kaoticlegion,2013-05-11T07:42Z,"Downloading now, already have a previous version. Tried using the updater but kept getting the ""Error getting details"" message. Is that fixed with this one?"
,aoxo,2013-05-11T08:46Z,"Like I said 3 posts ago, no the updater doesn't work.  Game doesn't seem to work either...it crashes when loading a map for me.  The last version loaded a map at least, despite the LUA errors lagging the game..

I'm not sure what the deal here is to be honest.  durka, the uploader, has his name branded on the ""updater"".  Every one of his other uploads seems to feature an updater.  Yet the only suggestions made are ""full off antivirus -> run updater -> run game with admin privledges"", followed up by, ""I can't help you"".  Anyone that asks why it doesn't run with AV or asks about positive detection gets, ""delete it and download another"".

Since the last version durka released didn't work I thought I'd give it another try...pointless.  If you try this and it works..and the updater works...comment and let us know.  I would appreciate being proven wrong.  If you try this and it doesn't work, and the updater doesn't work, then stop seeding it ffs."
,kaoticlegion,2013-05-11T10:08Z,"Finished download, turned off Trend Micro, and allowed both Gmod and the Updater through Windows Firewall. Still getting the same error message with the updater. If you can't find a fix for it and can't say anything besides ""I can't help you."" then you need to stop posting these."

If you have problem with updater: full off antivirus! Try install game to other dir.

,kaoticlegion,2013-05-13T08:18Z,"I'm pretty sure I said in my last comment that I turned off my antivirus AND allowed it through Windows Firewall. Still didn't not work. Instead of telling people the same redundant things, actually try to find a fix for it so that people won't have issues next time."

I can't help you. Download and install another builds (other authors) or buy it in steam. Good luck."
