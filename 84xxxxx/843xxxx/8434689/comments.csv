,marvelnerd76,2013-05-03T15:15Z,can't wait to check this out. I love reading these golden age/silver age classics now that I'm older and wiser. The stories are far more clever than when I used to look at them when I was young and ignorant.

i always found it interesting that dc chose to kill off don but not hank, and then that the kesels (under mike carlin's watch) decided to make the new dove a woman. i think it weakens the concept and allowed the readers to think that a pacifistic hero ""had to be"" a woman.

my favorite hawk & dove story of the last 20 years was the one-panel phrase ""don hall of earth, at peace"" when a black lantern ring tried to resurrect him.

mike baron's mediocre revamp attempt and the new 52 reboot were awful."
