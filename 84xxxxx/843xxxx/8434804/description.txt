The highly successful jazz musician C.K. Dexter Haven was divorced from wealthy Newport, Rhode Island socialite Tracy Samantha Lord, but remains in love with her. She, however, is about to get married to a bland gentleman of good standing, George Kittredge.

Spy magazine, in possession of embarrassing information about Tracy's father, sends reporter Mike Connor and photographer Liz Imbrie to cover the nuptials. Tracy begins an elaborate charade as a private means of revenge, pretending that her Uncle Willy is her father Seth Lord and vice versa.

Connor falls in love with Tracy. She must choose between three very different men in a course of self-discovery.
