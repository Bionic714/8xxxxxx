I had searched the net far and wide for "clean" edits of The Roots' discography.

Having failed to locate any I opted to create my own "non-corporate" edits of their

albums. While not perfect it allows fans to enjoy their music without the overt use

of profanity. Enjoy!


Studio Albums:

The Roots - Organix (1993)
 
The Roots - Do You Want More (1995) 

The Roots - Illadelph Halflife (1996)
 
The Roots - Things Fall Apart (1999)
 
The Roots - Phrenology (2002) 

The Roots - The Tipping Point (2004)
 
The Roots - Game Theory (2006)
 
The Roots - Rising Down (2008)

P.S. This is my second attempt at uploading these files.
