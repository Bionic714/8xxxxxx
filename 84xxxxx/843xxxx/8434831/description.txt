The film revolves around four male teenage friends in New Orleans, Louisiana: Matt, Zack, Jacob and Justin. As a celebratory routine, the boys purchase a bong and use that bong only when one of the four have sex for the first time. The boys are beginning to lose their virginity and Matt is the last one. Matt, as it is learned throughout the film, is the adopted brother of Zack after Matt's mother died from cancer when he was 9. Matt's father had drug issues and while still involved in his life, does not play a major role in it. Matt has been with his girlfriend Nicole for almost two years and the two decide to lose their virginity together on their second anniversary. Zack decides to videotape the entire process and it is portrayed as a documentary-type film.
