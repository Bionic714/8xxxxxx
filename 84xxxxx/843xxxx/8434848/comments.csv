Wouldnt uploading the MP3s be easier than converting the stream too. 

Thanks"

No, it's fine. I don't mind constructive criticism :)

I know that the quality is worse. However the way I see it is simple. Most of the guests that George or other hosts have on the show are on the phone. Since phones have an 8K quality either way, this (40 kbps) vs the original mp3s (64 kbps) are going to sound the same as far as phone quality. :)
Yes, hosts do sound a bit artifacted. It does suck a bit, but the tradeoff is that you get a more bassy and full-featured George rather than him being solo. Also, sometimes they'll play other recordings on air, such as movie clips, which they will not include in the MP3s.
I would edit the shows to c combine both (for example, paste bumper music in the original mp3s), however it would be a harder process. I might consider uploading both versions (untouched mp3s and stremed versions) in the future if demand asks for it. :)

Hope this helps!"

The original mp3's are much better."
