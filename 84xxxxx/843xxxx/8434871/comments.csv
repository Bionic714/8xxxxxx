goes to show hes new to UFOLOGY scene

but he does have a good compilation sometimes
and does a good edit on the zoomed and filtering then other groups do so hes tops with the video edit side of things"
[V],psspss,2013-05-03T17:17Z,"and hes right the video the cars parked the wrong direction to be UK..

looks like somewhere in europe

and the lights look too fake overlayed .. if something was happening more people walkign by would look up and it would of been on the news in UK"
[V],psspss,2013-05-04T02:22Z,"some leecher on over night halted it huh

,bmnott,2013-05-04T05:36Z,so um ur a ufo fan. me 2. what's ur fav ufo stories? i like alien mysteries.
[V],psspss,2013-05-04T05:43Z,:O comments seem a little flaky wont accept it all the time have to keep clicking
[V],psspss,2013-05-04T05:49Z,"theres 2 great stories the flatwoods monster

and the one about the guy climbing up the tree
name slips mind

both these sounded very similar with robots emitting gas

I say out tech has improved in 60 years for humans  so UFO tech should improve too.. maybe why the crafts have changed over the years and also the space suits.. now they know the planet as well no longer need these heavy metal suits

so now we can film them.. but now they have active cloaking skins.. LOL

just think if they had mobile phones with 8megapixels back int he 50s well late forties..
there was a wave of great stories between roswell and the 1950s

1956 was the new roswell crash of shag harbor"
[V],psspss,2013-05-04T05:55Z,"these ones might worth getting.. non xvids though

perhaps when I get them I make them xvid-ing for older players

but running out of data quick here.. which means i soon be left silent until a reset

,bmnott,2013-05-04T21:03Z,"which one is the flatsword monster.

i like some episodes of ancient aliens. 

makes me feel like there is something greater out there."
[V],psspss,2013-05-05T08:14Z,"3.. of them

first watch 1953 report the original investigator 
on radio describing it

then watch stanton on

then listen to stanton and the other guy researching it on the c2cam which gives more details that came to light since the 1953 one"
,bmnott,2013-05-05T18:06Z,"personally i wish there were documentaries and reenactments of more obscure paranormal stories from the loveland frog in Ohio to the little aliens in France reported by brother and sister.

i would like to learn how to manipulate occult forces for my own gain"
[V],psspss,2013-05-06T14:59Z,"what the chinese man was talking about UFO secrets in china was interesting of the large silver ufo

[V],psspss,2013-05-08T03:36Z,"

weird or shat is back.. heres one with a Alien UFO feel for some reason cappers are calling it S02 I think its cos usa were slow to air them.. canada aired s03 last year 

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8430224/Weird.Or.What.S02E01.Alien.Encounters.HDTV.XviD-AFG

I prob source them myself and rename them to S04 and air dates"
[V],psspss,2013-05-08T03:49Z,"
actually I already shared all them HQwebrips
last year or year before

life after death is
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6758834/Weird.Or.What.S01E12_(Host_William_Shatner)_-%5D%5B_(Reincarnation__

with new titles

so the UFO one would be S01E11
I think they got renamed anyhow"
