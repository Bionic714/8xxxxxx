First biography paragraph from All Music (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

British singer Sandie Shaw had a string of girl group-styled singles in the mid-'60s before she retired in the early '70s. Shaw was discovered by pop singer Adam Faith in 1963, who led her to his manager, Eve Taylor; she released her debut single, "As Long as You're Happy," the following year. It didn't hit the charts, yet her next record, "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me," hit number one in the U.K.; the single hit number 52 in the U.S., yet Shaw was never as big a star in the States as she was in the U.K. For the next three years, she had a string of hits -- most of them written by her producer Chris Andrews -- that kept her at the top of the charts. In 1967, Taylor began to move Shaw into cabaret territory; the approach proved a success when the Bill Martin/Phil Coulter song "Puppet on a String" hit number one. She recorded one more Coulter song, "Tonight in Tokyo," before returning to Chris Andrews. However, none of her further work with Andrews resulted in hit singles. Released in early 1969, her English version of the French "Monsieur Dupont" managed to crack the Top 20; it would turn out to be her last hit.

All Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):

This 26-song Sandie Shaw collection is one of the better compilations of the singer's 1960s-vintage work, though it's also a bit strange in that it doesn't follow any chronological order that one can discern. Opening with 1967's "Tell the Boys," the tracks "advance" to 1964 and then back to 1967, and, in addition to obvious hits such as "Puppet on a String" and "There's Always Something There to Remind Me," listeners get a liberal smattering of French- and Italian-language sides by the singer, including "Viva l'Amore con Te." Despite the chronological acrobatics, this disc is one of the better compromises that one can choose in the event that the four-CD set Nothing Comes Easy is a bit out of one's reach. The sound is excellent for its age, although more recent reissues may have an edge for those to whom state-of-the-art digital transfers matter, and the thorough annotation by Spencer Leigh more than makes up for the age of the release.
