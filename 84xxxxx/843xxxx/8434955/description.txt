First biography paragraph from All Music (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

British singer Sandie Shaw had a string of girl group-styled singles in the mid-'60s before she retired in the early '70s. Shaw was discovered by pop singer Adam Faith in 1963, who led her to his manager, Eve Taylor; she released her debut single, "As Long as You're Happy," the following year. It didn't hit the charts, yet her next record, "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me," hit number one in the U.K.; the single hit number 52 in the U.S., yet Shaw was never as big a star in the States as she was in the U.K. For the next three years, she had a string of hits -- most of them written by her producer Chris Andrews -- that kept her at the top of the charts. In 1967, Taylor began to move Shaw into cabaret territory; the approach proved a success when the Bill Martin/Phil Coulter song "Puppet on a String" hit number one. She recorded one more Coulter song, "Tonight in Tokyo," before returning to Chris Andrews. However, none of her further work with Andrews resulted in hit singles. Released in early 1969, her English version of the French "Monsieur Dupont" managed to crack the Top 20; it would turn out to be her last hit.

All Music Album Review (by Thom Jurek):

For starters, this Sequel edition features no less than 56 tracks, making it a whopping collection. It includes every recording Brit superstar Sandie Shaw recorded for Pye between 1964 through her biggest hit "Puppet on a String," in 1967. There are two complete albums here, a boatload of singles, rare EP and live tracks, an alternate mix of "I'd Be Far Better Off Without You," gloriously remastered sound, a foldout booklet with cool pictures and a full bio, as well as complete discographical information. Given that this is provided at a budget price -- two import CDs for the price of a single domestic one -- there is no need to debate. Anyone interested in the female singers of the era, from Jackie DeShannon to Cher to Dusty Springfield, needs this set -- and badly. After listening to the first half of this, there can be no doubt as to why everyone from the British Electric Foundation to Morrissey wanted her on their records in the 1980s.
