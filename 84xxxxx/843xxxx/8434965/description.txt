Description:
-------------
SolidWorks gives you choices of 3D CAD software, simulation, design and product data management, plus Product Documentation software. No matter the size of your company, you can always have the right tools you need to design better products.
3D CAD Software
The 3D design software SolidWorks helps you design better products faster. When you have an idea for a great product, have the tools to design it in less time and at lower cost. These are some of the features included:
Simulation design
With powerful simulation tools SolidWorks ┬« design, you can easily submit their designs to the same conditions in which you will see in the real world. Improve product quality while reducing costs and testing interactive prototypes.
Product Data Management
With SolidWorks Enterprise PDM (Product Data Management), distributed design teams can manage product data, share design information, automate workflow and improve collaboration between engineering and manufacturing departments.

Software 3DVIA Product Documentation
3DVIA Composer uses information from your 3D models to incorporate design changes directly seamlessly product documentation, to create updated materials, interactive and printed accurately.

Benefits:
------------
The ease of use allows you to be productive faster
The intuitive interface provides access to the powerful functionality
Views and presentations accurate 3D details
Reduced design time and product development
Elimination of map reading errors
Designs communicate easily during the design process.
Intuitive tools for constructing 3D models from your data from AutoCAD
Free Productivity Tools for users who come from using 2D.
With SolidWorks eDrawings, design concepts can be easily exchanged with external vendors, suppliers, customers and other users of CAD
It simplifies testing and design analysis.
The constant analysis is part of the design process of SolidWorks CAD software.
Performance with large assemblies
