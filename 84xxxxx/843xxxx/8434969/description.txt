First biography paragraph from All Music (by Chris Woodstra):

Despite having several moderate hits in both the country and pop charts, Sandy Posey was never fully embraced by either audience and is far from being a household name.

All Music Album Review (by Chris Woodstra):

The Best of Sandy Posey is a 14-track collection covering Posey's first recording period for MGM, including the classic forgotten hits "Born a Woman," "Single Girl," and "I Take It Back" -- oddly, all three peaked at number 12. Posey's mid-'60s songs, almost all depicting a woman helpless without -- or alternately, trapped with -- "her man," were slightly out of touch at the time and are artifacts now, but the slick pop-country arrangements have a timeless charm. Posey would have later success in the country charts in the '70s, but those hits are unfortunately not represented here. Though the album appears to be a straight reissue of MGM's The Best of Sandy Posey, this package actually expands on it by three tracks.
