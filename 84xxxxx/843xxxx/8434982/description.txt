A pregnant Ratna loses her husband, eventually gives birth to a son, Raju, in a hospital where she is treated by renowned Dr. Anand. Four years later, Anand re-enters their lives and starts becoming a frequent visitor. This does not auger well with Ratna's mother-in-law and Bela, her husband's sister, who make her life miserable, eventually forcing Anand to stop visiting. Shortly thereafter Anand gets married to a nurse, Maya Verma. Maya is a spendthrift,does not get along with Anand, and eventually finds out that she cannot conceive. When Anand's dad passes away, he leaves considerable wealth to Anand's child, including a monthly allowance of Rs.10,000/-. Maya initially plots with an advocate, S. Prakash, who is Bela's husband, who had assisted her in getting married to Anand, to try and prove that her late father-in-law was insane, and when that fails she and her aunt, Nurse Sarla Verma, concoct a plot that Ratna's son is really Anand's biological son, leading to their lawyer filing.
