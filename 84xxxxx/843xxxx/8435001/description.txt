Life on Meditrine Island is luxuriousΓÇªbut brief.
Marla Neuborn has found the best post-grad job in the world ΓÇô as a 'Lamplighter' working on Meditrine Island, an exclusive idyllic paradise owned and operated by a consortium of billionaires. All Lamplighters have to do is tend to the mansions, cook and clean, and turn on lights to make it appear the owners are home. But the job comes with conditions. Marla will not know the exact location of the island, and she will have no contact with the outside world for the duration of her stay.
Once on the island, Marla quickly learns the billionaire lifestyle is not all it is made out to be. The chief of security rules Meditrine with an iron fist. His private police force patrols the shores night and day, and CCTV cameras watch the Lamplighters relentlessly. Soon Marla will also discover first-hand that the island hides a terrible secret. SheΓÇÖll meet the resident known as the Skin Mechanic. And sheΓÇÖll find out why so few Lamplighters ever leave the island alive.
