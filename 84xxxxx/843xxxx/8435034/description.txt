Maynard Ferguson - 2005 - Plays Bill Holman's Arrangements: I Have But Two Horns

Until the early 50ΓÇÖs, Maynard Ferguson's fantastic technique was often said to obscure every other aspect of his work. With the tracks at hand, he revealed himself as a fine all-round musician, band leader and brilliant soloist, both in trumpet and valve trombone. Bill HomanΓÇôwhose works can be considered as some of the most representative of the West Coast school of jazzΓÇôonce said, "I've always tried to write things that sound like jazz, not like Bach revisited." Thanks to his arrangements and to the exceptional musicians who perform them, Ferguson expresses himself in a way he had never previously found possible.
