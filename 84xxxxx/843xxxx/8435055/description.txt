
In a city where information is heavily monitored, agile couriers called runners carry sensitive information on foot via the rooftops and skyways. Usually the police leave them alone Â– they have bigger fish to fry Â– but now something has changedÂ…

Play as Faith, the best and most agile of all runners, in an adrenaline-fuelled race to save her sisterÂ’s life as she unveils a bigger plot involving the whole city and the runners. MirrorÂ’s Edge is an action-adventure game that revolutionizes the genre by introducing a full body experience with dynamic 1st person movement and combat, in an immersive modern-day universe and with a socially charged storyline.
