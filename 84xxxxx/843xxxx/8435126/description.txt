HI-LARIOUS FILM! 

This is a film which slipped under the radar, I Honestly don't know why.  Christoph Waltz is in this film too (think Django) and he's very good in it! 

Fun Fact: It was entirely shot in one take!

PS: I wont be uploading many films, only ones which haven't been uploaded by either Hombasas or arctictpb or des961
