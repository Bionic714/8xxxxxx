,emcpower,2013-05-04T22:53Z,That was great! Thanks for the time you put into it. Looking forward to part 2!
,Quintary,2013-05-11T02:31Z,"I'm uploading part 2 right now, should be online soon"
,Quintary,2013-05-11T16:37Z,"I can't get part 2 to upload, every time it takes an hour or two just to upload the file, so I walk away and come back to my computer to find the PB upload screen but it's all blank and there is no sign that my torrent has been uploaded. 
What am I doing wrong?"
,Quintary,2013-05-11T16:51Z,"ok never mind. I got it.
Part 2 is here (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8463149)

And thanks emcpower! I'm glad you enjoyed it. Please share it with the world. I hope I can inspire other people interested in editing to do their own cuts. My next project will be trying to make a movie about Tyrion, my other favorite character, but that one will a lot more complicated because his story weaves in and out of other stories on the show so I will have to make more creative decisions to cut some things or possibly include some other things.

Interesting to see them all together... Flips one's perception a bit to see them removed from the larger context as well.

Thx!"
