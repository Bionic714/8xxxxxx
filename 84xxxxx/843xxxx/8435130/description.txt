If you feel, like I do, that Daenerys Targaryen is the most interesting character on Game of Thrones then you will appreciate this. I cut together all of the targaryen scenes from the first season into a single movie. 
I used iMovie to cut it all together into a 90 minute movie. I used avis from pirate bay, converted them to mov files, cut it up in iMovie and then converted it back to avi, so the quality is not great. I did this mostly just as an exercise in basic editing and to decide if I like iMovie (I don't, I'm going to use Final Cut for part 2). 
Look out for part 2, coming soon.
