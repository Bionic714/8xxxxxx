Balsam Range's third project, Trains I Missed, plays to the five-man bluegrass ensemble's vocal and instrumental strengths. Buddy Melton takes the lead on songs like "Trains I Missed and "Hard Price to Pay." Caleb Smith wrote and takes the feature vocal on "The Touch"; he also has the lead vocal on a song written by banjo player Marc Pruett, "A Heart that Won't Stop Loving You." Tim Surrett takes the lead on a classic Kingsmen quartet song, "Gonna Be Movin," with all four vocalists providing Gospel quartet harmonies.
