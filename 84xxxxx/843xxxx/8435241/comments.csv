[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-03T21:47Z,"wow this is amazing, your organization is impeccable! thanks Zlenny"
,Zlenny,2013-05-03T23:52Z,Thank you @STFmaryville. How are you (or bf) enjoying the Amazing Spider-man torrent? I'm thinking of doing the same with Wolverine but I hate the character so I need incentive for that one. 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-04T04:23Z,"that was a great torrent. i read back through all the 1980s issues i missed when i was a kid (i started reading amazing around #350).

hey if you want my advice, do what you love, and don't feel obligated to do the most popular characters!"
