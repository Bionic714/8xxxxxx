Uncanny X-Men, originally published as The X-Men, is a comic book series published by Marvel Comics since 1963, and is the longest-running book in the X-Men franchise. It featured the adventures of the eponymous group of mutant superheroes, a group of teenagers led and taught by Professor Xavier.

The book was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, met with a lukewarm reception, and was eventually cancelled in 1970. Interest was rekindled with 1975's Giant-Size X-Men and the debut of a new, international team. Under the guidance of David Cockrum & Chris Claremont, whose 16-year stint began with August 1975's Uncanny X-Men #94, the series grew in popularity worldwide, eventually spawning a franchise with numerous spin-off "X-books", including New Mutants, X-Factor, Excalibur, X-Force, Generation X, the simply titled X-Men
