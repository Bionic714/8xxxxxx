                        Taming Text - 2010kaiser
                        ========================


Taming Text is a practical, example-driven guide to working with text in real applications. This book introduces you to useful techniques like full-text search, proper name recognition, clustering, tagging, information extraction, and summarization. You'll explore real use cases as you systematically absorb the foundations upon which they are built. Written in a clear and concise style, this book avoids jargon, explaining the subject in terms you can understand without a background in statistics or natural language processing. Examples are in Java, but the concepts can be applied in any language.
Written for Java developers, the book requires no prior knowledge of GWT.
