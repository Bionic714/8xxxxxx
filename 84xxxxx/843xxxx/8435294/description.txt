"The Brave Monkey Pirate" by Hayes Roberts

The Brave Monkey Pirate, a children's book about a monkey pirate who has to go to the hospital and get a shot, but finds something magical that helps him be brave.

The book takes a whimsical approach to the very real childhood fear of getting shots (Roberts wrote the book with the input of his kids!). However, what you'll notice immediately are the wonderfully delightful illustrations of the little monkey's journey to a faraway land. It makes you want to, quite literally, dive right in.

Read this book to your kids before their next doctor's visit or to yourself before a big presentation. The 5-year-old in you will be glad you did.
