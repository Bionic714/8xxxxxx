Imperfection, 1

Noelle Evans has lived with a vicious scar down the side of her face since she was in a car accident ten years ago. She doesnΓÇÖt know what it is like to be touched, desired, or loved.

Isaac Welch is rich and stuck in a rut of loveless sex with gold-digging women. The moment Isaac meets Noelle, sparks begin to fly. He is intrigued by this startling beauty who has helped his brother.

What started as a game soon turns to blinding passion. Isaac tries to fight his growing feelings for Noelle, but she is about to learn the truth about their meetings. Will she ever be able to forgive his betrayal, or will Isaac be left with only the memories of his time with his Scarred Beauty?

Be Warned: anal sex, spanking.


Seed and Enjoy!
