V/8
A/5 for the first 40 minutes then i'd rate a 7 for the remainder. 

Picture is extremely good for a cam copy. There is some camera adjusting in the first minute but after that it is great. Unfortunately the audio is very hollow and hard to hear but it comes semi good around 40 minutes in (more clear).

By far the best copy of have come across so far.
