,Paindrain,2013-05-05T18:54Z,"Kawamito The hack is not a softmod, thankfully it is not a modchip either, it is a usb addon that tricks the WiiU into thinking it is a legit wiiu bluray drive, if I understand correctly, either way, its in production and is called the WiiKeU "
,R0YB0Y,2013-05-06T15:34Z,"Tnx Stifmeister..
was hoping U or Someone could please give us a link on how to hack WiiU to play WiiU Backups..

,ClipperCigars,2013-05-07T04:17Z,"Sigh... Remember the days when people like wanna-be pirates made the effort themselves to learn about how to do what they wanted to do instead of carrying on like spoiled rotten entitlement twats expecting to be spoon-fed every god damned thing. 

Playing games for free is not a god given right. It's a privilege for doing the work. Just like everything else from driving a car to being an open heart surgeon. You don't get to do them just because you ""want"" to. 

Instead of going to Piratebay, try going to google or bing and using a common sense search like ""how to play backups on wiiu"" and f'in read. If that is too much trouble for you, than you sure in hell don't deserve the rewards. Besides, googling and reading is the easiest part. If you can't manage that, you won't be able to utilize any information given to you anyways. "
,Neked,2013-05-07T05:19Z,"EXACTLY ClipperCigars. Nicely said. :)

If you cant read you wont know how to run these anyway so why are you even bothering downloading it?

I'm hoping the WiiKeU will let you back up your own games then I can put all I own on the HDD so they will be faster to load and less strain on the laser just like I did with the Wii. :)"
