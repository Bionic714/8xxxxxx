The award-winning action RPG is back, bigger and better than ever
 Torchlight II takes you back into the quirky, fast-paced world of
 bloodthirsty monsters, bountiful treasures, and sinister secrets - and, once
 again, the fate of the world is in your hands

Torchlight II captures all the flavor and excitement of the original game
 while expanding the world and adding the features players wanted most,
 including online and LAN co-op multiplayer. Torchlight II is fast, fun,
 and filled to the brim with action and loot. Adventure solo or online with
 your friends

Key Features
 Multiplayer - Play co-op with your friends via LAN or over the Internet for
 free. No subscriptions, no item sales. Our new matchmaking service lets you
 find friends, start new games, and join existing games. And, as always, you
 can play single-player offline as well

Customizable Characters - Players will create and customize a character from
 one of four brand new classes. Each class can be played as either male or
 female, with customized cosmetic features and looks to make each individual
 character stand out. All new skills and loot give loads of opportunity for
 unique character builds

Moddability - TorchED, the Torchlight II editor, will give players the
 ability to create their own mods, adding even more content to the world.
 Have your friends download the same mod and play together. TorchED will be
 available as a separate download very shortly after launch

New User Interface - Torchlight II boasts a new and improved user interface,
 designed to be easier than ever for new players to pick up and play. This
 intuitive interface ensures you can focus on playing the game the way you
 want to

Open World - We're not only in the town of Torchlight anymore Explore vast
 overland areas and multiple hub towns, fight through rain, snow, day and
 night. Our level randomization ensures new layouts, paths, loot, and
 monsters every time you play

New Game Plus - In New Game Plus, the game's not over until you say it is.
 Once you've beaten Torchlight II's primary campaign, you can start again
 with the same character for a significantly greater challenge. You'll keep
 all of the skills, gold, and gear you worked so hard for
 Pets & Fishing - These popular features make their return in Torchlight II
 in improved form. More choices, better effects, and your pet will still
 make the run to town to sell your loot so you don't have to
