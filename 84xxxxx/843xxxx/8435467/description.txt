What's cool about it:
Possess anyone you want and make them do your bidding
A grim Cyberpunk atmosphere with a touch of the divine
Save humanity from the Devil using your brains and your enemiesΓÇÖ brawn
Overview:
Bob is a working-class angel ordered by God himself to go and clean up the putrid, disgusting, sleazy, and infested world of the future. He has been given the power of possesion so that he can sneak up on any person, animal or genetically engineered being and leap right into their souls!

With your help, Bob can then use their bodies, their weapons, or even their bare hands to strangle, cripple, impale, and incinerate the cities of sinners sent to stop you from finding Satan himself. Hiding in their souls, Bob can use these sinners' bodies against their will as armor (to take pain for him), or he can use them for camouflage (to hide inside them) and pretend to be just another twisted citizen in the Messiah world...

The rules are up to you - enjoy the freedom.
