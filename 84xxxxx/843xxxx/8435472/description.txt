What's cool about it:
Wreak temporal havoc in 4 distinct time periods: ancient Greece, medieval Norway, near-future San Francisco, and high-tech Japan in 2455.
Incredible sidekicks as they provide cover fire, watch your back, and provide helpful feedback to assist you in your mission.
Pulse-pounding multiplayer action with two equally exciting modes of play: classic Deathmatch and Jewel Quest, a variant of capture the flag.
Overview:
In 2455 A.D. , Kage Hishima used the magical powers of the Daikatana, the most powerful sword ever forged, to alter time and establish himself as supreme ruler. You are Hiro Miyamoto, one of the few people on Earth who remembers what really happened. The burden of saving the world, your version of it, has fallen unto your shoulders. YouΓÇÖre not alone as your friends, Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara, travel by your side. You must gather weapons, overcome all obstacles, discover deviously concealed secrets, and battle a bewildering array of foes. Use your resources wisely as youΓÇÖll need all the help you can get. Are You Ready?!

From the rock star designer, John Romero, comes the legendary, in more ways than one, Daikatana (ΓÇ£long swordΓÇ¥ in Japanese). Run ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ gun is the norm here as you blast your enemies to oblivion with over 24 glorious, bad ass weapons. On top of the sweet, sweet guns, you are armed with the Daikatana--a weapon that grows in power the more you use it. Go on a wild time-tripping ride and make your enemies ΓÇ£Suck It Down!ΓÇ¥
