First biography paragraph from All Music (by William Ruhlmann):

As a solo artist, Diana Ross is one of the most successful female singers of the rock era. If you factor in her work as the lead singer of the Supremes in the 1960s, she may be the most successful. With her friends Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, and Barbara Martin, Ross formed the Primettes vocal quartet in 1959. In 1960, they were signed to local Motown Records, changing their name to the Supremes in 1961. Martin then left, and the group continued as a trio. Over the next eight years, the Supremes (renamed "Diana Ross and the Supremes" in 1967, when Cindy Birdsong replaced Ballard) scored 12 number one pop hits. After the last one, "Someday We'll Be Together" (October 1969), Ross launched a solo career.

All Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):

When it was released in 1974, Motown's Diana Ross and the Supremes Anthology was the most comprehensive compilation yet issued on one of the 1960s' most popular groups. A 35-track triple LP, it superseded the 1967 double-LP Greatest Hits, including 17 of that album's 20 tracks, as well as the 1969 Greatest Hits, Volume 3, all of which was repeated. All 27 of the Supremes' R&B hits between 1962 and 1969 were featured, as well as 28 of their 30 pop chart entries. That represented a formidable chunk of the decade's biggest hits, among them the chart toppers "Where Did Our Love Go," "Baby Love," "Come See About Me," "Stop! in the Name of Love," "Back in My Arms Again," "I Hear a Symphony," "You Can't Hurry Love," "You Keep Me Hangin' On," "Love Is Here and Now You're Gone," "The Happening," "Love Child," and "Someday We'll Be Together." The lengthy album also found space for some of the group's musical experiments, devoting a five-song side, dubbed "Versatile Stylists," to material culled from the albums A Bit of Liverpool, The Supremes Sing Country Western & Pop, We Remember Sam Cooke, The Supremes Sing Rodgers & Hart, and Diana Ross and the Supremes Sing and Perform "Funny Girl." They made for an interesting interlude, but the heart of the matter remained the Supremes' brilliant interpretations of the Holland-Dozier-Holland hits of the mid-'60s, which were all here. 

[The Diana Ross and the Supremes Anthology (Motown 794) was released as a triple LP containing 35 songs in May 1974. In August 1986, Motown issued a 50-song double CD under the same title (Motown 6198). Nine years later, the label again revamped the Anthology idea for a 52-track double CD (Motown 0511) released on September 28, 1995.]
