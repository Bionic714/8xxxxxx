First biography paragraph from All Music (by William Ruhlmann):

As a solo artist, Diana Ross is one of the most successful female singers of the rock era. If you factor in her work as the lead singer of the Supremes in the 1960s, she may be the most successful. With her friends Mary Wilson, Florence Ballard, and Barbara Martin, Ross formed the Primettes vocal quartet in 1959. In 1960, they were signed to local Motown Records, changing their name to the Supremes in 1961. Martin then left, and the group continued as a trio. Over the next eight years, the Supremes (renamed "Diana Ross and the Supremes" in 1967, when Cindy Birdsong replaced Ballard) scored 12 number one pop hits. After the last one, "Someday We'll Be Together" (October 1969), Ross launched a solo career.

All Music Album Review (by William Ruhlmann):

The Supremes were signed to Motown in January 1961, and the 25th anniversary of that event provided the hook for yet another compilation. This one is a triple-LP/ double-CD set, one half of which, or 20 tracks, is given over to the group's biggest hits of the Diana Ross era, from "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes" (1963) to "Someday We'll Be Together" (1969). The other half of the album consists of previously unreleased material from the same period. Motown used to cut tons of songs on its major groups compared to what was released, and here we have outtakes from the Rodgers & Hart album (initially planned as a double-LP), from the never-released Disney Classics album, and from other sessions (some of the tracks later reworked into released songs), plus movie and promotional appearances, including an interview and commercials. All of that makes this a good album for collectors to seek out, though there's nothing revelatory. (Originally released in March 1986 as a triple-LP by Motown as Motown 5381, 25th Anniversary was reissued in on October 14, 1986, as a double-CD by Motown as Motown 6193.)
