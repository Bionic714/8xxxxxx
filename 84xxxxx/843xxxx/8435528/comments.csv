[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-04T01:03Z,"definitely not forgotten....

but still working to break out of the red and sit in the black long enough to make the necessary purchases.

still needing to get narnia 3... and the last 2 underworlds finished up... not to mention harry potter 7 part 1"
,surek666,2013-05-04T01:33Z,Thank you!! I was looking forward to this movie with great quality :D

@dhjudasx:

Thanks for the movie Transformers (2007). Just downloaded this movie transformers (2007) and watching now on big TV screen.

Question: Why is the video quality looks like a bit grainy image like in darker scenes, i see a lots of burry images. Is the physical blu-ray disk comes in same video quality like movie 300. And also there is no bass effect in sub woofer LFE channel. The 5.1 channel audio is also so low quality like yify rip."
,buenio,2013-05-04T03:08Z,Please upload The 2 Expendables and All Bourne Movies!

,onlyHD,2013-05-04T07:52Z,Thank you very much judas !!!
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-04T08:33Z,"rajakumar

Some of that is indeed due to the bluray disc, and high compression making it difficult to do a good high compression job without really pumping up the bitrate .. would be better with 10 bit encoding though.

as for the sound... the 5.1 audio is fantastic, and actually among the loudest when played back in both 2 channel and 5.1"
,rajakumar,2013-05-04T14:13Z,"
So have you now increased the bit of the audio on upcoming releases. What is your next movie releases. You are still uploading all old movies, no any new 2012 - 2013 movies now."
,mi.tom,2013-05-04T17:54Z,thank u so much....judas.Much appreciated.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-04T19:01Z,"rajakumar

Audio bitrate has no reason to be increased.. 192kbps 5.1 2 pass HE-AAC/LC v2+ I've stated several times is already unable to be discerned from AC3 448-640kbps 5.1. There is no value to increasing it unless I attempt to get close to the master/Raw LPCM audio qualities.

I've posted the list of movies, they range from 1950's all the way up to 2012/2013. What will be posted next is entirely random to a certain extent. This will not change in the future.

What I post is what I post, repeated requests for specific things will not change things much at all, and it definitely won't if I don't even have the movies on bluray.

It costs a LOT of money to buy each bluray... something I do not have any at all atm making it impossible for me to upload movies I don't already have in my possession let alone new ones recently released."

,LowDef,2013-05-04T20:24Z,"hey judas quick idea, ever thing of renting the blu ray at redbox or check it out on bluray? instead of buying it"
,dalesteyn,2013-05-04T20:28Z,"loving it...one of the best animation movie ever..fantastic movie,touched my heart!!!
i have  requests for you provided you have time for it...can you do 1080p rip of HEAVENLY CREATURES(1994)(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110005/?ref_=sr_1)
 and SENSE AND SENSIBILITY(1995)(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114388/) ???
there is no affordable rip of these movies at the moment..so please let me know if you'll be able to do it...appreciate your work...hope one day you will concentrate more on foreign movies... :)"
,LowDef,2013-05-04T20:49Z,"hey judas have you ever thought of redbox, or a local libaray, that way you dont have too pay $20 a movie"
,buenio,2013-05-05T07:56Z,@Judas i think you should increase your video bitrate from 2250 to 3000kbps and your 5.1 audio from 192 to 448 kbps because we don't care for the file size we care for quality over quantity. Just a Opinion :D
,Murukai,2013-05-05T21:24Z,"guys seriously quit nagging the man he's ripping encoding and uploading movies on his free time, its not his job. and for people asking for higher bitrates READ his reasons and if you have read them then go to another torrent because his uploads are obviously not for you. In short he encodes for highest quality for the smallest size. also, if you like his torrents SEED them."
,htlywho,2013-05-05T21:44Z,hey judas du u hav mission impossible series 
,nisemeru,2013-05-05T23:50Z,"Thanks, mate! you rock! Love your work. :) Looking forward to whatever you've got up next in the queue, whenever you're able to share it. Keep up the amazing work, but be good to yourself."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-06T04:33Z,"in regards to bitrate..


increasing video bitrate by 750kbps will have no significant impact on animation.... and very little to no impact on the common film... while it would likely show a slight improvement for 1080p film that is actually 1920x1080... rather than 1920x816.... most of my tests have been relatively fruitless.. i'd have to crank the bitrate quite high before it would be nearly completely indistinguishable from a bluray...

as for audio bitrate... unless I want to try and replicate the dts-master or DD TrueHD or even 6 channel lpcm raw audio formats.... there is no advantage to bumping up the audio bitrate on a 2 pass loosely enforced bitrate encode using aac 5.1... using the above 3 as the source audio. HE-aac/lc v2+ is a super high efficient audio format... a 192kbps (if you view media info for my encodes, I don't think a single one actually ever falls below that of 225kbps average and frequent spikes to 275-325kbps is common so 192kbps isn't an accurate value but I give it as it's my base setting used)... as I was saying 192kbps aac5.1 2 pass he-aac/lc v2+ is equivalent to that of 448-640kbps AC3/dts/dd.



As for the redbox or renting... no such places exist here... even block buster and rogers rentals have been out of business here for nearly 5 years or more. And when I say here.. I mean the closest ones were 100 miles away at the time.

Either I buy.... or don't...

I have to drive 100 miles just to see a movie in a theater... so the kinda tells you how often I actually go to a theater... think it's maybe once a year kind of thing. come to think of it.. the last movie I watched in the theater was dark knight... with the joker.... so it's been quite a few years lol."
,buenio,2013-05-06T12:30Z,@Judas thanks for the info 1 more question judas are your fast and furious released are ripped from this and source??? http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6658929/The_Fast_and_the_Furious_1-5_(2001_-_2011)_1080p_multisub_[mkvon
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-06T16:58Z,"I never use any downloaded source... I've neither the bandwidth/speed required nor the wish to use such.

Every SINGLE ONE of my encodes come DIRECTLY from a physical bluray disc I have in my bluray collection, every single one of them.

This is the ONLY way to guarantee 100% that it's the best possible flawless encode I could do with the best audio and video with given settings.

This is also the reason my encodes usually have a huge edge because they are not simply fast encoded rips that are used as a source by 99% of the other encoders doing a similar job that download the 6-12gb sources.

Everything I do is entirely my own work... I rip the bluray disc... I encode it... I manually do up the subtitles.. and I pack it. I even do the uploading of the torrent manually."

That was in response to someone making several claims about how a 1080p movie was not 1080p but was 720p or 800p due to being 1920x800..."

[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-22T04:16Z,"rajakumar

Hulk plays fine on all my devices and tvs I've tried..

LG seems to be the most unreliable for playback sometimes.

I clearly show in the description what the individual video bitrate and audio bitrates are set to. They are VBR however so they aren't likely to be EXACT. In fact I've stated repeatedly that the AAC audio is rarely ever that low and usually for the 5.1 track average 225 and peak at over 300."
