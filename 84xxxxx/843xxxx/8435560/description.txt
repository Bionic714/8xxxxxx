Now I know what many of you are thinking....
.
Paramount never released this one on 3D Blu-Ray so after years waiting for a 3D Blu-ray copy, we decided to just go ahead and make it. 
For many, this completes their 3D Blu-Ray disc collection and is the only movie worth spending the time it took to make this. 
Streams were taken and re-encoded to AVC/MVC files from a 3DTV Capture and packaged with the Master Audio only from the Blu-Ray. 
Subtitles rounded up off various releases globally. 
No it does not have a Main-Menu or Title Screen, its Auto-Play 
.
This is a 3D Blu-Ray Disc so before you waste your own bandwidth and/or complain on a torrent as special as this one, please know and understand what an .iso type file is first.  
.
Yes this plays in 2D or 3D and is 1080p AVC/MVC Encoded left + right eye Stereoscopic Real 3D.
