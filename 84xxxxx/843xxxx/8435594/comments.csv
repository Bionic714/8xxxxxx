--

A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new vault
hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the
evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion
weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for
revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living
planet.

Key Features:
All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes
including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into
the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield
any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill
to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine
guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if
that s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are
multiple classes to choose from!
Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online
and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in
and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of
that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other!
World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of
Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil
surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe
-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also:
he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)
87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust
after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much,
much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!
Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of
Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the
dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you ll
be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!
Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in
Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers
and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the
new enemies in Borderlands 2.

,NumbedChaos,2013-05-04T00:23Z,"Thank you so much, RELOADED and Stifmeister. This update is exactly what I was waiting for. It was a pain applying each update and DLC alone."
,rylgmr06,2013-05-04T01:03Z,There already was an update like this one. RELOADED only made it their own ;)
,rylgmr06,2013-05-04T03:03Z,"You better can get BlackEcho's release of the same! Because:

- RELOADED forgot to add the Pre-Order DLC (POCollectors, POPemiereclub and POGamestop)!!
- Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage is English only
- Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty is English only 
- Sir Hammerlock's Big Game Hunt is English only
- Everything else is multilang, including the Mechro and Psycho Char. 
- RELOADED's Crack has a new save location.
- You need to add the DLC ID's manually for the RELOADED's Crack 

So, that's why! No offense, RELOADED. You're doing a good job ;)"
,noekk,2013-05-04T03:14Z,"This is a shit release. You need to have Steam running in order for it to start, and you *can not* use the Steam registry trick like you can in the better Borderlands 2 releases. I doubt it will work on Windows 8 as well, although I'm not sure about that because I'm not installing the Steam advertising trojan just to run this piece of shit."
,dimonakid,2013-05-04T17:51Z,"I can Asure you that the REG file for Steam Works Like A Charm!

Just Run The REG (& add it to Registry)
 Play!

DOWNLOAD STEAM REG File:"
,wroth91,2013-05-04T20:03Z,"Works great on windows 7, used it to upgrade my previous setup by skidrow, does NOT require steam to be running but does run well with steam, did have to add some of the dlc ids manually  (mostly costumes) but that is my only complaint"
,sath123,2013-05-06T17:03Z,how do you add the dlcs manually?i can say ihave the psycho character installed bcoz i se his class mods for sale ingame and the game gives me a message that i need a latest update for me to run the game properly.SO PLEASE TELL ME HOW DO YOU ADD THE DLC IDsMANUALLY  FOR THIS RELOADED VERSION like rylgmr6 mentioned?
,onepeace25,2013-05-09T15:16Z,im a bit confused; do we place it inside the 2k file or the borderlands 2 file?
,jadrdc,2013-05-09T17:24Z,Can i install only the update because i already have everything else?
,jadrdc,2013-05-11T16:44Z,I don't have the new character Krieg the psycho. Why? If someone could help me i'll be gratefull.
,TheWalkingHell,2013-05-13T19:31Z,"the only complain i have about this is that you cant change the language and you're force to be named ""RLD!"". I dont really care about the language but if someone knows  how to change the name (i've already tried the name changer and the skidrow.ini but it doesnt work), i will be very gratefull!"
,cpanda,2013-05-18T07:47Z,So I downloaded and installed and now I can't seem to be able to access my old characters. I still have the saves and everything so I'm not sure how to direct my game to recognize my old saves. Help thanks
,mochajag,2013-05-23T15:56Z,"""Dummy File: This is not the .exe you're looking for."" I keep getting this error. I've tried launching it from the launcher and the game .exe, but nothing is working. Ran both as administrator. Nothing. I heard that the game had problems for other people on Windows 8, but it never had a problem for me. Please help."
,light001,2013-05-26T12:59Z,"Hey if you guys are stuck trying to figure out how to get your old save files back, You go to My Documents> My Games>Borderlands 2>Willow Game> Save Data.  
IF you just updated there should be 2 folders, with a long list of numbers,look at the date created. Find the older one and drag all the stuff from that one into the newer one and yes replace the 1 file or w/e then ur good 2 go. But again this is  Light, and im still wondering how to change my name from RLD! in the main menu for multiplayer purposes over hamachi, any feed back is great sky_hack@hotmail.com"
,light001,2013-05-26T13:11Z,"Ok so i found out how to change your name from RLD!   its in the steam_api.ini file, open it up scroll to the bottem, see the name and change it, Any feed back send 2  sky_hack @ hotmail.com"
,surinen,2013-05-27T02:27Z,how to unlock dlc? I do not have mechromancer pack avaible - I've seen info about adding dlc ID but how to do it?
,wrecktem,2013-06-01T02:36Z,"This works, but you will need to fix your save files. Another comment here explained how, go to the Saved Data folder and copy the contents of the older folder into the newer one.

Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is included, but it's useless, for you cannot gain experience or level up past 50 with this update."
,wrecktem,2013-06-01T05:02Z,"This does not work the way it says.

I installed Borderlands 2
I installed this Update
I cracked using the game's cracks
I cracked using the update's cracks

I've tried every variation of cracking and installation, this is a bad torrent. If you install from scratch, then apply this update, it will NOT work. Just do every DLC individually."
,BluBlaBlu,2013-06-10T11:10Z,Is this one working with the purchased version from Steam?
