Your personal trainer, Shaun T, will push you past your limits with 10 workout discs packed with plyometric drills on top of nonstop intervals of strength, power, resistance, and ab and core training moves. No equipment or weights needed. Just the will to get the hardest body you've ever had. 

The secret to these mind-blowing results: MAX Interval Training.

The result: burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour and get the most insane body in 60 days. 

Shaun T's Max Interval Training techniques are a step ahead of every other fitness program as it is designed to get you a lean, muscular body in such a short amount of time. The Insanity Workout is a difficult workout, but the results are bar none.
