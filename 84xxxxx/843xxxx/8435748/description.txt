The life of a young Chris starts getting out of control at the moment she is drugged by the petty thief. But something bigger and more important is about to happen. It is involuntarily involved in the life cycle of the microscopic world that gives life to plants, animals and all nature. During his extraordinary journey that Chris finds a kindred spirit in the face of a lonely Jeff. Like her Jeff was involved in a situation that could hardly explain. Sharing the same life they are trying to find their place in the world and re-organize their lives. "Color flow" is the latest film by actor-director Shane Carter, who successfully transports the viewer into the heart of human consciousness and makes him think over each image on the screen.
