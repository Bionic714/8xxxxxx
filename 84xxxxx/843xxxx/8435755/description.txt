GameBase is what's known by the emulation community as an "Emulator Frontend". It is basically a program that makes
running games on various emulators very easy, so that you don't have to remember lots of command line parameters and
config settings. GameBase is also the Official Frontend for the GB64 Collection of Commodore 64 games!
Once you've downloaded the GB64 database and screenshots, you can use GameBase to view all the games, listen to sid
music and even launch games themselves in various C64 emulators.

Each game in a GameBase database can store more than just a game or rom file. It can also store a music file, game docs,
screenshots, and really any other files you wish (these are referred to in GameBase as Extras). For example, in the GB64
database, each game-entry in the database stores not just the game file, but also a sid-music file. You can add such extras
as game docs, a magazine review, a cover scan, an mp3 remix, a link to a web site... the list goes on.
All these Extras are conveniently accessible in GameBase via a simple drop-down menu directly under a game's screenshot.
