,grampa05g,2013-05-07T15:20Z,Hi Sparaml. Does your launcher work on xp sp2 ? Cause everytime I try to open it I get this ERROR http://s12.postimg.org/k6x9t819p/error.png
,Sparaml,2013-05-17T19:07Z,Get the latest java version.
,NULUSIOS,2013-05-22T10:15Z,"Not an issue yet, but potential issue later.
Original launcher has updated to V0.8.1.
Do you plan on an update or just waiting of new release will need that?"
,AbdoZaghloul,2013-05-26T01:58Z,"When playing with snapshot 13w21a there is a sound problem
At first the sound is good but after some time playing, there is no sound at all
What is wrong ??

P.S, snapshot 13w18c is working great"
,NULUSIOS,2013-06-08T15:07Z,"New versions (13w23) no go.
Launcher has reached version 0.8.3.

Help?"
