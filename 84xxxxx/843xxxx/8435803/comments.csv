[V],Gh0stNet,2013-05-04T09:35Z,People this is most likely have been uploaded by the developers as a joke with piracy bug! so don't download it and also don't trust what other user say as developer have made several accounts in tpb so only download it if some TRUSTED or VIP users uploads it here

,TymonTheThief,2013-05-04T11:04Z,"I honestly wouldn't give two shits about a crappy junk game like this. But when you troll the community and use statistics that YOU CAUSE as grounds to bitch and moan, you make more enemies than you convince. I'm usually in the market of piracy to try shit out WITHOUT bullshit restrictions at my own pace, to make an actual educated decision on if it's worth paying for or not. If it is not worth paying for, then I trash it. If it IS worth paying for then I actually do buy it! There are exceptions to the rule of course. I generally say fuck any big business developers, like adobe, Microsoft, EA, and so on, because they fuck their customers over enough that I don't feel a twinge of guilt at all repaying the favor in kind. Now, the same thing could be said about this shitty game which is a ripoff in of itself. I actually plan on pirating it when the real version of the game comes out, just out or principle. Anyone who intentionally fucks with people, deserves what is coming to them. Funny thing is, if you didn't pull this bullshit stunt, I might actually have been a paying customer instead."
[V],Gh0stNet,2013-05-04T12:40Z,I just checked this torrent's content with the original installer and its the same.so you can download it without the fear of the stupid DRM Bug.
,TacticalSheep,2013-05-04T13:39Z,Shitty game. Great torrent. Works like a charm.
,idleloss,2013-05-04T14:19Z,"It's funny the devs are so adamant about anti-piracy measures, because the game itself is a ripoff of a successful Android game."
,faraday0,2013-05-05T00:04Z,"i won't buy this game. why? read:

on the official blog, main dev posted an interesting message regarding piracy. apparently, he injected a code into program that sends him data whether you have a pirated version or not. in other words, dev confessed he's gathering our private data, enough to identify every one of us, without telling users beforehand. so yeah, he basically mocked people who pirated his game in his blog in a needlessly overweening manner.. he's a huge asshole. i hope his shitty little company goes bankrupt really fast. don't buy this game."
,aedziex23,2013-05-05T02:50Z,"@faraday0

So what? He cant do anything with the data He collects, except show pointless graphs of how many ppl pirate games... Nothing we already know. He got tons of publicity and ppl are buying his game now.

Simple solution is to block the game exe in your firewall."
,faraday0,2013-05-05T09:51Z,"@aedziex23, naturally he can't use the data he collects in any way other than informative purpose and he knows it. but note, whenever some program actually collects data from your computer, you usually get a legal notice requiring you to accept or decline.. that's what big companies do to avoid any legal trouble in future to protect their asses.

what really annoys me is the fact that he uses the info to create some silly graphs to show how he apparently gets cheated by gaming community, especially if when he's obviously stealing ideas from a game we all know. 

most games i've bought in my life are indie games. I always support small companies, because they usually create innovative non-mainstream games that I love so much. but Game Dev Tycoon? no. never. not with such attitude."
,aedziex23,2013-05-05T12:22Z,"@faraday0

Yes, good choice not to buy the game. But like I said, if those 93% of users who pirated the game used a firewall to block the connection were wiser, then none of this publicity would of happened. I guess there will always be a large population of non-savy internet users who do not know what a firewall is for and fall victim to legal threats or slime like these developers.

Apparently the developer was ""inspired"" by Game Dev Story, but you can clearly see some aspects of the game are stolen. This was debated several times on the official forums and the posts were censored and taken down by the developers... 

He got what he wanted in the end and that was FREE publicity, He's already talking about a sequel so the game must be selling well. btw the game is so overated if you ask me, it's broken in so many areas and not moddable. The slime developers wont get a penny from me either."
