Dr. Constance Petersen (Ingrid Bergman) is a psychiatrist with a firm understanding of human nature - or so she thinks. When the mysterious Dr. Anthony Edwardes (Gregory Peck) becomes the new chief of staff at her institution, the bookish and detached Constance plummets into a whirlwind of tangled identities and feverish psychoanalysis, where the greatest risk is falling in love. A transcendent love story replete with taut excitement and startling imagery, Spellbound is classic Hitchcock, featuring stunning performances, an Academy Award┬«-winning score by Miklos Rozsa, and a captivating dream sequence by Surrealist icon Salvador Dali.
