,keeganzo,2013-05-04T03:28Z,I sure wish you'd upload a smaller file for these programs...they're only 20 minutes long and I can't fit 190MB into my download schedule for JJ since I only get 45-50 kbps speeds half the day....the other half is 0...is there anyway you can up a small file for JJs...I'd love to watch these...thanx

There is no where else to get these episodes from to my knowledge so I am just happy to be able to get them.
If the up loader has to spend time making them smaller he probably won't bother and stop up loading all together, and we don't want that."

,keeganzo,2013-05-04T08:43Z,Yes..I agree RossPat...I'll just live without JJ then...I'm an American living in a 3rd world country and am lucky to have any internet at all ... speeds are just a bit fast than dial up so I have to be very selective about what I download....20 min. vid at 190 MB doesn't qualify...and I don't wish to ruin the JJ experience for others
