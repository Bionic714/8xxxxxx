,dalesteyn,2013-05-04T06:11Z,"just a suggestion,can u please increase the video bitrates of those movies which won't be encoded in 1080p [NOT UR FAULT,SOURCE MATTERS :(]
i have no idea if increasing the video bitrate helps it (720p movies) to look better on bigger screen(such as 26""-30"")..again i'm saying i have no idea if it happens...but IMHO as there will be no 1080p rip(LIKE NIXON,GIA unrated)in the near future atleast,so  you might give it a thought..idk that much about encoding,just a theory came to mind so wanted to share coz i think unlike many uploaders you actually try to listen to us...anyway thnx for this one.... :)"

if possible can you upload robert de niro's

,jalucian,2013-05-05T09:05Z,"dalesteyn my suspicion is that you're right, and that 720p with a 2250kbps bit rate is going to look better on a bigger screen than a 1080p with a 2000kbps bit rate. If I started doing that I'm sure sure I'd get a few questions (why are your 720's no smaller than your 1080s - I can hear it now) but if our theory is correct, then it makes sense to, at least on movies that there is no 1080p version. 

You see for a long time I had thought that a 1080p needed 2.25x the bitrate of a 720p to have equal quality. I thought this for two reasons: One, YIFY's 1080p's are always, on average, 2.25x the bit rate of his 720p's. Two, the math bears this out in terms of total number of pixels: (1920x1080) vs (1280x720) = 2,073,600 / 921,600 = 2.25. But then I noticed that my 1080p's still looked perfect on screens much larger than my 720s were able to look perfect on.  So apparently, for some reason I cannot explain, total number of pixels don't have any bearing on the bit rate. However, if I've been wrong about that all this time, YIFY's been wrong about it even longer, because his average bit rate ratio between his 720s and 1080s is almost exactly 1:2.25."
,dalesteyn,2013-05-05T13:16Z,thnx for the response jalucian...the whole encoding thing is so hard to understand(atleast for me)....even you guys are experimenting daily to get it right....that's why i really appreciate your work...thnx again for your view...hope it(our theory) will see the light one day :)
,jalucian,2013-05-07T15:46Z,"Already decided to implement it, dalesteyn. First 720p encode with the new improved bit rates will be The Image, which will posted Thursday or Friday. I've decided that if there are no good 1080p sources and I have to go with 720p, I'll use the same bit rates I do on the 1080p's so that they'll look just as good on larger screens. If, however, it's something I'm releasing both 1080p and 720p versions, the 720p version will be around 1000kbps instead of 2250 to keep file sizes down for those with smaller screens. The Naked Gun, which was only available in 720p will be the last 720p without a 1080p counterpart to be done in the lower bit rate range. It will be released some time after The Image even though it was encoded first, so don't wonder why you're seeing a lone 720p with a lower bit rate after The Image. Thanks for the suggestion dalesteyn!"
,dalesteyn,2013-05-07T17:51Z,"thnx jalucian for implementing it and dat too so quick..the idea made sense to me,very happy that you've also realized it.This is a great news for us,who watch movies on slightly larger screen...no more worries!!! :)"
