With the movie Iron Man 3 out this weekend, it's a great time to put together a torrent of Iron Man graphic novels.

Several of these have been posted in the Comics section before (some of them by me), but a few of them may be new to your collections.

I've renamed the files by the year the book was published, for the benefit of the random Robert Downey, Jr. fans who stumble in here.

Hey movie fans, if you're new to comics, you can read all of these except one using free comic book reader software. Two of the most popular are CDisplayEX and ComicRack. The other one is an Adobe .PDF file.
