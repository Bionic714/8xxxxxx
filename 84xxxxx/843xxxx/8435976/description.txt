Simple Minds are a Scottish rock band who achieved worldwide popularity from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s.

In 2012, Simple Minds released a box set called X5, it covered their first five albums.

This collection of CDΓÇÖs is the next five albums and continues on from where the X5 box set left off.

Like the X5 Box Set, I have used the re-mastered versions released in 2003.
