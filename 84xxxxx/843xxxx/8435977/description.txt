"An eccentric but talented writer with a great jazz-pop voice. Though the stylistic collisions in her singing sometimes result in confused mannerism, Snow is a true original. Unfortunately, since the debut LP, the confusions have dominated." ***
- Stephen Holden, Rolling Stone

"Although the rumors of a major new artist that began after the success of "Poetry Man"--still her sappiest song, although the lyrics here aren't what they call creative writing--originated with fuzzy-minded mongers, I'm pleased to report that her trademark melismatic quaver hasn't degenerated into a gimmick, and I acknowledge that this is a good record of its type. I just have my doubts about how good a jazz-folk mood-music record can be. Money isn't all that's "worthless/When your music's mirthless"--sometimes the music is as well." B
