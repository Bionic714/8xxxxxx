[T],vonRicht,2013-05-06T17:35Z,"Oh KurosawaFan, you are correct there aren't any extras in the torrent.

It's a mistake that I wrote 'Yes' in the info. I didn't realise it was wrong before you made me aware of it.

Very sorry for the inconvenience, mate. :(

I can't change or edit the torrent info, cause TPB hasn't got their edit feature up and running. "

,hellboy1119,2013-05-07T23:05Z,vonricht please tell me what is the source of this rip???? EUR BD or the American Bluray coz the American only will have the best video quality compared to the RUS/EUR releases
[T],vonRicht,2013-05-07T23:49Z,The rip is from a CEE disc.

That's bullshit. I see you never had a movie in more BD versions, well then prove it, don't just claim. Often I've seen better transfer then US in FRE, GER, POL, RUS, Sony or others. 
You may say though that 40 % of the US transfers are better then other versions, 20 % of the US transfers are worse and 40% of BD-s are just equal in quality.
Besides the differences are almost impossible to notice, or is just a matter of taste (more pixelated but more detailed or less pixelated but less details, or more blueish etc..)"
