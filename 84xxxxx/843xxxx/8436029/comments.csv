,azybuzza,2013-05-05T04:26Z,"think u gotta check your player, works just fine for me"
,azybuzza,2013-05-05T04:28Z,it's an .mp4 if that helps ;)
,ladancerly,2013-05-06T09:34Z,I too have audio but not video - playing on Windows Media Player? 
,azybuzza,2013-05-09T02:07Z,"Works in my windows media player, I have some K-Lite Codec Pack installed, maybe you're missing codec to play mp4? If u can't play it in wmp, you should try VLC. That's all the advice I have ;)"
