,stewgriffin,2013-05-07T12:17Z,"Hi lokii_187.  Please continue to seed.  I'm only 20% of the way there, but will continue to seed until there are at least 10 other seeders."
,vashtii,2013-05-07T15:24Z,You have to give it time! 27GB is a big file and it will probably be a few days before the first downloads complete.
,lokii_187,2013-05-07T17:02Z,"I continue to seed all my torrents until they reach 10 seeds as well, just to ensure they do not become lost forever on TPB. Good call on the size of the torrent though, please first people to finish rank the quality as i cannot do it myself with any scrupples lol "
,stewgriffin,2013-05-09T10:41Z,"Agree with above - it's the size that's he problem.

I'm still downloading - current progress is 60%, which is the maximum availability amongst the swarm at the moment.  Meaning no-one as more than me and no-one will be able to seed until Lokii seeds another 11.4Gb.

Sorry Lokii it looks like you need to hang-in-there a bit longer, but with 131 people in the swarm at the moment - when the extra GB is available there should be tens of seeders.  This is a popular torrent."
,bundschu,2013-05-09T21:49Z,"Same situation here. I am stuck at 63% and now most of the time it shows 0 seeds or 0 of 1. 

If we could just get the rest I will seed for a long while. It's just a huge file. But a great one."
,lokii_187,2013-05-10T18:59Z,"Sure is a great one, had to share. I will continue to seed for a long time, no worries :) I couldn't sleep at night knowing I left any of my Bay-Brothers (or Sisters) with only a fraction of an Epic torrent such as this!! Cheers all, Live long and _____ ;)"
,stewgriffin,2013-05-11T10:08Z,"Latest update.

Utorrent is showing 

292 peers (wow)
72% availability in the swarm
7.6GB remaining

I'm guessing there's a whole bunch of us with similar numbers.  As soon as this hits 100% availability there's gonna be 50+ seeders and things will get a lot faster for the rest. It's going to be another week at this rate.  Should we start to run a sweepstake/book on how many seeders there will be within 1 hour of hitting 100% availability?  :^)"
,bundschu,2013-05-12T21:14Z,It's.......getting.......closer.  Over the three quarters mark.
,stewgriffin,2013-05-13T17:33Z,"Latest Update 82% availability,  339 Peers.  Hang in there everyone!"
,Cyborg2112,2013-05-14T10:52Z,Thank you for your supreme effort.  It's a 5 year mission...
,lokii_187,2013-05-14T18:55Z,"Sorry it is not faster all, I'm working on obtaining access to a server which should speed things up exponentially for my future torrents. I just adjusted a few setting specifically for this torrent for now though, hopefully you all noticed the increase, if only a wee one.  "
,stewgriffin,2013-05-14T23:43Z,"Cyborg 2012 - 5 year mission! - LOL

Captains Log:
We're at 86.5% availability
378 Peers
At this rate should be 100% within 4 - 5 days 
4GB remaining"
,johnny31874,2013-05-15T04:58Z,87% and barely going anywhere. please seed!!!!
,lokii_187,2013-05-15T05:40Z,"I think you missed the boat on that one Johnny boy... But its cool, so long as when your download completes you help the needy and seedy with me brother!!"
,stewgriffin,2013-05-15T10:05Z,Patience Johnny the Dilithium Crystals cannae teek any more.........
,lokii_187,2013-05-15T16:25Z,"Aye Aye Stewie, she can barely take it, I need moor power... Switching power from AV-Shields to auxiliary fibre-optics :p"
,stewgriffin,2013-05-15T23:55Z,"Over the last 23 hours we've gone from 86% to over 91% availability.  If Lokii can continue to seed at this pace we'll hit warp speed in 48 hrs.

I have had a look at the files within the torrent that are complete and quality all looks good."
,bundschu,2013-05-17T03:08Z,He's dead Jim.
,stewgriffin,2013-05-22T07:23Z,"Captains log, supplemental.

So after 24 hours of reaching 100 % availability we were at a peak of around 166 seeders.  We're now hovering between 50 and 60 seeders. I couldn't help noticing today we've got 494 Peers.  Well-done Lokii a popular and healthy torrent.  

Anyone wondering if the wait (to download 28GB) is worth it, I've checked-out a number of episodes on big screen TV from each of the 3 seasons and quality is good, no issues found.  All episodes nicely labelled with title.  A very professionally crafted torrent by Lokii."
,aleistersenna,2013-05-25T05:30Z,thank
,landstoff,2013-05-25T21:48Z,"Hey lokii_187,

It seems to me, that the episode order is wrong in your torrent. At least for season 1. I guess you made the order based on the production number, not on the Date when the episode was on air.

Check this:
http://epguides.com/StarTrek/

Can you confirm, or is there a misunderstanding?
Thanks, mate."
,landstoff,2013-05-25T21:54Z,"Hi lokii_187,

It seems to me that the episodes are in the wrong order in your torrent. It is based on the episode's production number, not on the date when it was on air.

Check epguides dot com. 

Can you confirm it, or do i misunderstand something?
Thank, mate"
,lokii_187,2013-05-26T05:02Z,"I am very glad you brought this topic up, you are technically correct, although I listed them this way because Gene Roddenberry stated years ago that Production order is a more accurate depiction of his vision; and I wanted to pass this along to viewers. Since there was no continuity among episodes, there's no specific reason for the broadcast order that was used, aside from post-production delays and the network's choice of the ""strongest"" episodes to lead in the seasons. In the later series, when broadcast order differs from production order, there's generally a valid reason for it in terms of story sequence (for instance, the two parts of ""Unification"" were shot in reverse order due to Nimoy's availability, but naturally broadcast order is the only logical one), although not always (like when four first-season VGR episodes were held back to season 2 and aired out of sequence). Production order makes more sense in terms of the gradual evolution of the sets, the costumes, the storytelling, and subtle aspects of the characterizations and relationships.

For instance, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" obviously belongs well before the rest of the episodes, due to the different crew composition, sets, uniforms, and equipment. And ""The Corbomite Maneuver"" has Kirk and McCoy talking about Rand as though her posting as Kirk's yeoman were still a novelty, so it's more logical as the first Rand episode than the fifth. It is completely up to you guys which order you decide, although if you have not watched them in this order I truly recommend it, you will not regret the subtleties missed through broadcast vs production order. Cheers all, sorry for any confusion but I hope this clears up any questions."
,WhoWas,2013-05-29T04:28Z,Keep seeding everybody! :)
,amajors2,2013-06-02T06:17Z,"Took me about a day to download. The picture quality of these are awesome.
I will seed until the 23rd century!"
,stewgriffin,2013-06-06T20:53Z,"Two weeks since we came off impulse power (single seed) and hit warp-speed (multiple seeds) and still we have 76 seeders !!!   Keep seeding, this one is going places. Impressive that amajors downloaded it in a day when it took us pioneers a month.  Good torrent Lokiii - thank you!"
,Synthesist,2013-06-10T10:52Z,"These are not the new CGI remasters.  Why has this not been mentioned?  I checked ""The Doomsday Machine"", the episode with the most new CGI FX, and it is the old broadcast episode."
,Synthesist,2013-06-10T11:25Z,"OK, this is 2004 while the remaster with new CGI FX was 2006."
