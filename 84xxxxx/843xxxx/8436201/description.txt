Book 1: Beyond Shame (Beyond #1) by Kit Rocha (September 16th 2012)

All Noelle Cunningham has ever wanted is a life beyondΓÇôbeyond the walls of Eden, where only the righteous are allowed to remain, and beyond her stiflingly restrictive existence as a councilmanΓÇÖs daughter. But only ruins lie outside the City, remnants of a society destroyed by solar storms decades earlier.

The sectors surrounding Eden house the corrupt, the criminalΓÇômen like Jasper McCray, bootlegger and cage fighter. Jas clawed his way up from nothing to stand at the right hand of Sector FourΓÇÖs ruthless leader, and heΓÇÖll defend the OΓÇÖKane gang with his life. But no fight ever prepared him for the exiled City girl who falls at his feet.

Her innocence is undeniable, but so is their intense sexual attraction, and soon theyΓÇÖre crossing every boundary Noelle barely knew she had. But if she wants to belong to Jas, first sheΓÇÖll have to open herself to the gang, to a dangerous world of sex, lust and violence. A world where passion is power, and freedom is found in submission.

Book 2: Beyond Control (Beyond #2) by Kit Rocha (March 19th 2013)

She refuses to be owned.

Alexa Parrino escaped a life of servitude and survived danger on the streets to become one of the most trusted, influential people in Sector Four, where the OΓÇÖKanes rule with a hedonistic but iron fist. Lex has been at the top for years, and thereΓÇÖs almost nothing she wouldnΓÇÖt do for the gangΓÇªand for its leader. Lie, steal, killΓÇöbut she bows to no one, not even Dallas OΓÇÖKane.

HeΓÇÖll settle for nothing less.

Dallas fought long and hard to carve a slice of order out of the chaos of the sectors. Dangers both large and small threaten his people, but itΓÇÖs nothing he canΓÇÖt handle. His liquor business is flourishing, and new opportunities fuel his ambition. Lex could help him expand his empire, something he wants almost as much as he wants her. And no one says no to the king of Sector Four.

Falling into bed is easy, but their sexual games are anything but casual. Attraction quickly turns to obsession, and their careful dance of heady dominance and sweet submission uncovers a need so deep, so strong, it could crush them both.


Seed and Enjoy!
