Trying something new here, seeding it as a complete zip file through netkups (it will keep seeding even if I'm not). The zip contains the complete CD in Apple Lossless format, with ID3 tags, and high quality scans of the original disc sleeve (inside and outside).

Tracks 1 - 4 are the demo tapes for CBS records with Clive Parker from 'Spizz Oil' playing drums. 'Lost Patrol', 'Wake', 'The Crossing' and 'Echoes'  Produced by Adam Seef at CBS Studio. The early recordings are of very good quality. The live gig that follows the interview clip is Big Country's first show ever at the Glen Pavilion at Dunfermline, (playing to a home crowd, mainly Skids fans)  It's raw, but quite listenable.
