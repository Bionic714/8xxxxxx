Friday, May 03, 2013 10:47 AM
Glenn, Pat and Stu are live from the NRA national convention for day 2.
  Glenn discusses updates about the shooting that happened at the Houston National Airport
  by the loan gunman with questionable motives and a strange suicide note.
  Also, more government wasteful spending as the DOD decides to buy "green" jet fuel
  for the air force at a rate more than 15 times the amount of normal jet fuel.
  Plus, Jerry Falwell Jr, chancellor of Liberty University to discuss the arrest of a young student
   over his gun rights.
