,deejoy,2013-05-08T23:34Z,"Or instead of being a dick . .  you can research the problem and find the answer......When you install, stop at the options section (where it mentions the High Resolution Texture Pack, Shortcuts, etc.) and look at the top option that says ""GUI"", click to expand and change to English. Problem solved."

in order to change the language:

1. open the sleeping dogs file location

2. Scroll down, you will see a file called LumaEmu

3. open it

4. change language to 'english'

5. save file, run Sleeping Dogs"
