,swine666,2013-05-05T20:10Z,"Ryan Gosling is so dumb! At the beginning of the film he is presented with a baby of some trailer trash bitch and instead of DNA testing the dubious legacy like nobody's buisness to see whose it is, he takes it for granted and starts going after banks! "

,page04z,2013-05-10T06:41Z,"such a stupid movie. seriously, early in the movie it takes a ridiculously stupid curve, with the introduction of a new character who suddenly becomes the main protagonist? wtf is that all about."
,WinVery.com,2013-05-10T20:37Z,Ryan Reynolds did a movie in a box.  
,Phatfish,2013-05-11T03:57Z,"A - Ok

V - Ok

M - Pretty good. In desperate need of editing down though. It's a bit slow. Also the chase scene is so over the top ignorant that it's kind of hard taking it fully serious after that. One police car vs. a stunt rider on 500cc+ bike, bitch please..."

,drotte,2013-06-01T08:05Z,"I know it's a goofy request but any chance of getting Monster Jam World Finals, broadcast May 24th 2013 on Speed HD? Need this desperately and DRM is kicking my ass."
,7175,2013-06-01T20:21Z,"@cryotoxic86 - Roflqueef I know, I use the online ratings and 1mdb demography breakdown as the main determining factor in how I judge a movie I haven't seen. Male average rating>female average rating has consistently shown to be a good movie: in some way intellectual (raises 1 or more questions in your mind), dark, captured 'organic' violence, grounded anti-superficiality, the vagina anomoly: female who thinks for herself and is attractive(Jennifer Lawrence), etc.. 

Anyway, I actually payed to see this movie, and it's excellent, you just need an open mind and Gosling Syndrome, the movie is not good or bad but Gosling. Don't expect Drive, more like (Drive + Blue Valentine)/2 + (Silver Linings Playbook - Jennifer Lawrence)*(Depakote)/2."

I am so sick and fucking tired of this cunts crap ..if you have not noticed he is more then just TV team as well he uses about 6 fucking accounts with all the same stolen torrents to push his fucking bullshit fucking crap website....
