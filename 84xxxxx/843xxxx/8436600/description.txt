A definitive, primetime guide, The Space Age: Nasa's Story
offers a fresh look at an amazing organisation and
mankind's quest to understand the universe. Blending
stunningly restored footage with revealing, insightful and
engaging interviews with the people who were there - the
astronauts, family members and journalists - this is an
epic story of the heroes, the triumphs and the tragedies of
space exploration.

Starting with NASA's beginnings in the Cold War, the BBC
science series follows the iconic moments of space
exploration from the race to get the first man in space to
the first steps on the moon. And with triumph and
achievement comes risk and disaster, as the series follows
the white-knuckle suspense of Apollo 13 and the tragedy of
the shuttle Challenger.

Intelligent, inspiring and accessible, The Space Age is a
complete history of mankind's journey into space.
