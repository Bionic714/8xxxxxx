What's cool about it:
Great, dynamic cutscenes with outstanding camera motion
A gripping detective mystery that will keep you hooked right until the very end
Memorable characters with believable personalities
Overview:
Two separate murder cases, in two separate lifetimes - so similar in the smallest of details that one could believe they were performed by the same person. Impossible! One of the crimes took place 75 years ago, while the other just happened! Is someone copying an old serial killer? Or is it remotely possible that the same murderer is still alive and committing more crimes?

In this thriller adventure, you'll play as Victoria, an FBI agent, in modern Chicago as well as her grandfather, Gustav, P.I. in Prague in the 1920s. Explore Chicago and Prague and solve puzzles while preforming investigations in two time periods.
