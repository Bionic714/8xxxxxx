,topalkur,2013-05-04T14:07Z,"I just read an arstechnica article on the developer's piracy stunt. Smart and funny, but I just want to say something. 
I very rarely buy a game without playing the full version first and when I did I was left mostly disappointed. Definitely wouldn't gamble with an obscure developer. I have nearly 200 games on Steam."
,urretado,2013-05-04T23:36Z,"Yea, also read about the version released here on TPB having a part in the game where your company starts getting hurt due to piracy.

Can someone confirm this is said version or not?"
,tjuicee,2013-05-06T05:12Z,"My Girlfriend played this DL for about an Hour and 1/2 and received the ""Pirated"" message. She only received it once and hasn't received it again (yet). If anyone else can please confirm and we can remove this Torrent, That'd be great...

Long Live TPB!"
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T08:48Z,"Just wiped out the foldedr:
C:UsersyournameAppDataLocalGame Dev Tycoon

Then I installed the game, the readme in program files reads ""Game Dev Tycoon DEMO v0.9"" which is not promising. I'll play for a bit and update with a screenshot."
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T11:17Z,"This is also a broken copy of the game, screenshots for proof.

Started and got achievement for buying the game:

[V],Gh0stNet,2013-05-06T11:49Z,"Go troll some where else Metalzulu this is the legit version and you only get this thank you message 
http://i.imgur.com/c9eSYlp.png (which you posted) only in the legit version.."
,Deborg,2013-05-06T17:50Z,"Metalzulu , so wheres the problem? The screenshots are all legit , the 4th is a rip off to ur game not piracy... Just sue em , and continue playing . On the Dev released torrent , u would geth a completely different massage with a sad face."
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T23:43Z,"Yeah, sorry Gh0stNet, you're right. I'm on year 28 with 200 million. Thank you for uploading the only good copy and I'm sorry for saying it's broken!

THIS COPY IS LEGIT!!!

Screenshot for proof: http://i.imgur.com/KmG9JqU.jpg"
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T23:44Z,"@Deborg

I realized that after getting to year 20 or so with millions that it wasn't actually broken. I misread the screenshots as being the pirated message since it's basically the only message I've received."
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T23:46Z,"Also, Gh0stNet, I received the thank you message in the first copy that I downloaded and I went bankrupt about seven times due to piracy on that copy. I think the only difference is that the message after so many successful games says ""illegal"" instead of ""pirated"" in the real version.

Either way, thank you for your hard work."
,nklh4x0r,2013-05-07T18:55Z,man i love this game
