Maynard Ferguson - 2007 - Dancing Sessions

This release contains the complete contents of the original Maynard Ferguson big band LPs Plays Jazz for Dancing and Let's Face the Music and Dance, plus three rare bonus tracks taken from the same sessions and previously issued as singles or on compilation albums. The two albums presented here, recorded in 1959 and 1960, come from the zenith of this orchestra and present Maynard Ferguson's vision of dance music at a time in which dancing and Jazz were undergoing serious decline. By 1950, Swing music seemed a thing of the past. Modern Jazz focused on small formats or big orchestral scores which targeted concert halls as opposed to dancing establishments. Most of the dance scene had been taken over by Rock 'N' Roll and R&B bands. 26 tracks. Jazz Beat. (Amazon)
