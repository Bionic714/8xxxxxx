[T],analogreflections,2013-05-04T15:07Z,"You're most welcome. :) I'm 32 and in my time taping music to cassettes was the best thing :)
I still have lot of music on tapes, not so many records though. I don't remember when they used to put these, but it certainly bring back memories :) cheers, mate."
