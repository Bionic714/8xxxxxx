Internet Explorer is the most widely used browser in the World today. It supports the latest Internet technologies like RSS feeds, Ajax, ActiveX controls, and many more. This is a version which was designed to run on machines with Windows7 SP1.

The improvements to Internet Explorer are as much about what you don't see as what you do see. New Internet Explorer has a streamlined design, fewer dialog boxes to click through, more intuitive navigation, and many new features that speed up your web browsing experience.

Internet Explorer Key Features:

Fast and fluid
Built to take advantage of the full power of Windows 8 and Windows RT, Internet Explorer 10 starts and loads sites almost instantly. It brings a fluid responsiveness to the web that feels totally new. Everything you want to do on the web is a swipe, tap, or click away.

Perfect for touch
Truly full-screen browsing: Navigation controls appear only when you need them and quietly get out of the way when you donΓÇÖt. Internet Explorer 10 lets you flip ahead or back through your websites with the flick of a finger. Tiles and tabs for frequently visited sites are oversized for easy tapping. 

Easy
Smooth, intuitive controls work just as you'd expect. One Box is both address and search bar for speedier navigation. Pin your favorite sites to your Start screen and get to them as quickly as you access your apps.
