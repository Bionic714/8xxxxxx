Book Description

If you're a busy woman "on the go" with no time for gyms or eating right,
then this book by best-selling author Jennifer Jolan will show you how to lose all the weight you want from home,
and without changing anything in your diet.

The book is called: "The 1-Minute Weight Loss Cheat Sheet."

And that's exactly what it is -- a short guide on how to lose weight in just a few minutes per day.

Here are some of the secrets inside:

How to "rub" belly fat away with the palm of your hand! (Just rub your belly in this exact spot and you literally incinerate fat cells.)
How to speed-up weight loss and give your body a surge of energy simply by "tapping" your throat! (Sounds incredible, but it's real, and it's worked for thousands of women who wouldn't otherwise lose stubborn body fat!)
The REAL reason why so many women are not losing weight -- even if you eat right and exercise hours a day! (I've seen women go from a size 18 to fitting into size 8 jeans after learning about this.)
A secret way of using your shower to stimulate rapid weight loss in your body. (This is the fastest known way to literally "cheat" your way to losing a lot of weight very quickly you'll ever see!)
Hands down the best (and quickest) fat loss exercise ever invented. (Best part: it only takes 1 minute at a time each day and no special equipment or money!)
How to "breathe" fat out of your body. (Did you know you could lose lots of weight just by changing the way you breathe? It's true, and inside you'll learn exactly how to do it.)
How to eliminate an entire pound of weight with a brush! (Be one of the few who knows this trick!)
How to use your finger tips to "burn" away fat deposits after meals. (Doing this 6,000 year old Chinese health secret ALONE will lead to accelerated weight loss and also reduce gas, too!)
A crazy simple way (almost nobody knows about) to "dissolve" cellulite off your body while watching TV! (And believe it or not, there's NO exercise necessary to do this!)
