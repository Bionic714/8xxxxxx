,XebroLeazier,2013-05-04T16:00Z,Does it have to be the Gold Edition? or not Gold Edition but patched up 1.8 is ok?

[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-05-04T16:35Z,"@Breaksense: Its uploaded by an automated bot so everyone here gets a release directly after its been released.
And making a script that finds a cover and upload it to bayimg isnt so easy to fix, well if you can do such script to this bot, your welcome.
Or else, enjoy this as it is, you are getting everything here for free so why complain...

To everyone else: Enjoy! :D"

,dzoni87,2013-05-05T14:17Z,"For those who got ""Can't apply patch because MMH VI is not yet installed"" error:

You DONT actually need that Repack version of Gold. Those files are probably already cracked or altered in some other way, therefore prevents you to install the patch.

However there is workaround system, though a bit complicated. Download any Non-Gold edition of Base Heroes VI (TPB have plenty of those) and patch it manually all the way through 1.8 (you can find all of the patches at any online-based patch archive web site i.e. ""Patches scrolls"" etc.). Important: DONT crack it before installing ""Shades of Darkness"" or you will screw up the whole process. "

1. Right click on Might and Magic.exe or the short cut. 

2. CLICK properties, after that you well see some names like Security, Information, etc. 

3. FIND Compatibility, click , and then you will see something like compatibility Mode.

4. Click on, compatibility Mode.

5. In compatibility Mode, scroll and find the same OS your are using. If you have Windows 7, choice Windows 7. If you have XP, choice XP, If you have Vista Choice Vista. 


I really hoped it helped. If you use other language it will have different names. But I really hope you can take these words like ""compatibility"", ""Properties"" and translate it, if you have difficulty with something. Peace and fight for freedom "
