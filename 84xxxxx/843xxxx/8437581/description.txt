ΓÇ£An enthralling movie that truly deserves the word 'visionary,' this stylistic tour de force by Uzbek master Ali Khamraev is almost unclassifiable ΓÇö a mystic vision, an eastern Western, a pageant of colour and movement, a portrait of adolescence painted in broad, expressionistic strokes. A young boy gets a brutal sentimental education under the open skies of medieval Uzbekistan. Man Follows Birds moves from one sumptuous moment to the next ΓÇö rides through ecstatically coloured landscapes, a trio of friends waking up covered in apple blossoms, the hero imagining his beautiful and long-dead mother in images that have an abstract power and beautyΓÇ¥ (adapted from Film Society of Lincoln Center). 

ΓÇ£Mind-bending ... Man Follows Birds merits comparison with Paradjanov ... Khamraev is a towering figure, a wizard with landscapes (they all seem charged, often enchanted) and an instinctual genius with actorsΓÇ¥ 
(Kent Jones, Film Comment). 

ΓÇ£A Paradjanovian medieval pageant of boyhood under primal pressure ... Man Follows Birds is where the Uzbek art-film heritage truly beginsΓÇ¥ 
(Michael Atkinson, Village Voice).
