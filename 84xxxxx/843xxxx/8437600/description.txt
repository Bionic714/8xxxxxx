Description:
It is one hot summer day and Lily needs to cool off. She sees that her neighbour is enjoying the day in his pool, so she asks if she can partake. He is more than willing to let her use his pool, but only if she does something for him in return. I hope she doesn’t do anything I wouldn’t do.
