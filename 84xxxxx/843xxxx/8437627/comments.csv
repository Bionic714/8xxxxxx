These 540p torrents take up time and useless space. C'mon man, get with the times!
Cheers as always Nepotu. Sad to see my boys bow out today, but their comeback in the 4th to go on a 20-0 run to get within 4 was a Herculean effort. "

And no mark_phil, we don't need 540p torrents. They take up time and space. Get with the times and buy a HD TV man!"
