Blair Dyson found her dream manΓÇöthe sexy, wealthy and powerful Trevor BakerΓÇöa real-life version of all the alpha males she read about in countless romance novels.

But the relationship is nothing like those books led her to believe it would be, and now she wants out. A stunning discovery of one of TrevorΓÇÖs secrets gives her the push she needs to make the final break.

Free of Trevor, she vows to focus on her rapidly advancing career and to put men to the side for a while.

Or could it be the right time? A casual arrangement with Sam might be exactly what Blair needs as she reclaims her life.

Before long, she finds keeping things casual with Sam more complicated than she expected, and erasing Trevor from her life more difficult than she hoped.
