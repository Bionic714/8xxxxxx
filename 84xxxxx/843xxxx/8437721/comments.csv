,TruWING,2013-05-05T17:02Z,"@YIFY - I really love your torrents! But I have an issue with the fact that NONE of yours ever have 5.1 sound. Why is this?

I read in another one of your torrents someone complaining about the exact same thing. And how they tend to avoid your torrents because they always lack 5.1 sound. I tend to agree with them. "
,MiCoRRiz,2013-05-05T20:19Z,"@TruWING totally agree with you man, i oftenly avoid yify torrents and choose some from asianplanet or JYK just because the sound =/

but i prefer yify video quality, if he used 5.1 it would be no doubt the best!"
,MiCoRRiz,2013-05-05T20:20Z,"*often, not oftenly -.-"
,as00270,2013-05-12T15:46Z,"Image quality absolutely fantastic for this size
IF ONLY ... the yify group could finally move to 5.1. sound ..."
,M_Dudikoff,2013-05-17T08:54Z,i concur.. but the size for a br rip is just so nice. under 4gb is the magic no.
