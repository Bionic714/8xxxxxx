,swampmatt,2013-05-11T02:42Z,"Very nice image quality, but I wish I would have noticed that 

this is hard coded with ENGLISH subtitles. 

If they are speaking english, why do you need to also read english? I found myself READING this movie instead of WATCHING it. I'll have to watch more closely to be sure I don't get any more like this. Detracted from the movie BIGTIME. :("
