,TunaHead,2013-05-06T05:26Z,Be careful with this application guys. It will delete files without confirmation.

Maybe there's something in settings that you can turn off?"
,Altaraz,2013-05-06T16:57Z,"Instructions:

- Install BitDefender

- Create an exception for exe files (in order to prevent issues with the activator)

- (If necessary) extract the activator

- Reboot into Safe Mode

- Copy activator and paste it into the program’s installation directory (Local Disk>Program Files> Bitdefender 2013)

- Run activator as Administrator; select language, settings, click Activate

- Reboot normally

- Alter settings to your satisfaction; there should be no issue(s) with continually updating the product

P.S: As for issue(s) with files, it is important to tell the program what you want it to do/not to do. Go through the settings of each Module (Antivirus, Privacy, Firewall, etc.) and modify those settings to your satisfaction.

P.P.S: For those having issues booting into Safe Mode in Windows 8:

- Press ""Windows Key"" + 'R'

- In the box that pops up, type in: msconfig

- Click Enter

- In the next box that pops up, click the Boot tab up top

- Look for the Safe Boot option, and check the box beside it

- Below that option (in this case), select the Network option

- Click Ok

- When prompted, click Restart


To Reboot normally:

- Follow all previous steps; only this time, deselect the Safe Boot option, then click Ok, followed by Restart"

After I follow your instructions the Activate button is not clickable only reports and settings. Am I doing something wrong or is the activator no good any more "
