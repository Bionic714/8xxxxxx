,bcgarant,2013-05-04T23:25Z,when should we expect HDTV rips of this show?
,alienoar,2013-05-05T05:58Z,"this is a netflix original so I don't think there will be any ""HDTV"" rips coming unless they license it to a network"
,bcgarant,2013-05-05T19:49Z,House Of Cards was netflix original too and had HDTV rips so i assumed this might eventually too
