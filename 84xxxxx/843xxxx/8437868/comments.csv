,pythonista99,2013-05-04T17:00Z,This looks VERY interesting !  I only hope it all works out and you can maintain an initial seeding.
,Robin1966,2013-05-04T17:32Z,"Many thanks my friend.

Will seed a ratio of 1 : 1 as always!"
,spenkie2,2013-05-04T19:15Z,"pythonista99, don't worry. I will. "
,The_Abee,2013-05-06T17:06Z,"Well, I guess I'll have to bookmark this torrent, coz there's a tons of material that I'll be needing in future. Thanxx a ton man!. Appreciated. :)"
,tyl3rdurd3n,2013-05-06T20:23Z,This... is useful. Thanks. :) 
,pythonista99,2013-05-10T18:52Z,I'm afraid my original concern was spot on.  This thing has died.  Very sad indeed.
,spenkie2,2013-05-10T20:06Z,No it didn't.. what are you talking about?
,pythonista99,2013-05-10T22:23Z,"I realise this is a big torrent, but it's 6 days on and there's exactly 1 seeder and 200+ leechers.  That's not a good sign.  I've only selected about 5 or 6 topics, and nothing has come down for over 40 hours.  That looks dead to me."
,spenkie2,2013-05-10T23:18Z,"I'm uploading with 100kb/s, which is all I have. I've uploaded 47GBs by now. About 70% of the pieces I upload to peers are circulated. Therefore,  it will take about 4 more days before the first new seeds will appear. 

It might take a while, but this doesn't mean that this upload is dead by any means. "
,pythonista99,2013-05-11T07:46Z,"Ah - thank you for that explanation.  With any luck, and considering the quality of the material, the quality of the leechers will be high too and this will go on to become an epic torrent.  Thanks."
