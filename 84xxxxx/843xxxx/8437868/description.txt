This is the complete set of Open Yale Courses. These courses are also freely available http://oyc.yale.edu/. 

The torrent is useful because now you don't have to go to a separate webpage for every session of a course and separately download the mp3, but you can have them in one go. Furthermore, I provided some meaningful tags and filenames for the mp3 files. Should save you a day. 

You can use these audio courses as audio books on any mp3 player.

All courses are recorded in a bitrate of 128kbps, in stereo. Also note that a couple of courses are zipped. I had to do this because otherwise the torrent could not be uploaded because of too many files on some torrent sites.
