Follow the instructions to make your own .avi.

I'm trying to promote this so that 1) you'll get a better quality .avi compared to some others who post re-encoded .avi files and 2) so that others don't have to use all of their limited bandwidth just because most of you won't/don't/can't convert to .avi.

If you took the time to figure out torrents it is HIGHLY recommended to take some time to figure out how to convert formats.

Kind of goes with that old saying: Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for life. 

Learn to fish.

[T],trialNerror,2013-05-10T00:24Z,"I used the original audio from YouTube FLV files for season 3. It works on my comp (tested with VLC, Media Player Classic, iTunes, and QuickTime), PS3 (streaming and via USB), and on a cheap little portable media player, so figured it wouldn't be an issue.

But there appears to be an issue as when I try to convert the audio track to any other format it bogs down the encoder and shows a VERY small file size (750 KB) for the output file. Hmmm. 

Might be on to something at the moment for a fix, but if what I'm doing is what it takes to make it work, it's not going to be a really simple easy quick fix. Well, it can be, depending on ones own technical PC skills. ;)"
