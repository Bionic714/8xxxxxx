SCSA 420's scum, all videos are poorly recorded (some even include commercials on TV) and sounds are out of sync ... scene4all it's a lot better."
[T],SCSA420,2013-05-06T06:57Z,"NO fucking commercials on any of my releases jackass!!! WHO has the Pirate SKULL next to their name (I DO) and who doesn't??? (YOU) Oh and if you're too much of a lazy ass to install the proper video and audio codecs on your PC for 60 FPS video playback don't blame me if your slow ass pc can't play it. Sure is funny but ALL my 720p HD releases play on LG, Samsung and Philips BluRay players, pc's, mac's, iPad's, iPhone's, Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4 smartphones, PS3, Xbox360, etc. Also its not my fault since you're the one who is actually the SCUM you F'N loser."
