,SirPeterRussel,2013-05-04T21:38Z,THE REPEATED TITLES (COMPARED TO CHESS LITERATURE 1) HAVE FULL ANNOTATIONS THIS TIME
,beatles94,2013-05-05T14:52Z,What program do you use to open it. I use shredder and it's old so it can''t open these file. 
,SirPeterRussel,2013-05-06T09:43Z,"I use Chessbase 12 and Chessbase 11. The chessbase programs are preferable to Fritz concerning the work with so many databases. The databases are archived, so extract them first, than open them with Chessbase. The easiest way is to drag the PGN, or the CBV, or the CBH file to the databases window of Chessbase.
OK?"
,beatles94,2013-05-10T16:05Z,Thank you. Sorry. I'm not so good with computer things :D
