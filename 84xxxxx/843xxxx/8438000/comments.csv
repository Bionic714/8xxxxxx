,JoeyBats19,2013-05-06T21:34Z,I used to watch all the files I got from 'EZTV' on my ipod. When I go to add them now it says it cannot be played on my ipod. If anyone know what I could do it would be greatly appreciated. Did something on my end change or is it the file?
,animalmcburger,2013-05-13T05:09Z,"JoeyBats19, the file is already an mp4 so it should play just fine.  If it keeps giving you that error, download a video converter and convert the file from mp4 to mp4 again.  It should let you.  I'm sure the file that comes out on the other end should play just fine.  Whatever the problem is, finding it is going to take a lot longer than just converting it.  You could also convert it to a .mov"
