,webkilla,2013-06-08T00:41Z,"I'm having a problem running the game. It install without any error messages - but upon running the game it sort of loads up, but then it just gets stuck on a black screen. Using win7 64bit gaming rig. I'm guessing some kind of compatibility or graphics issue? How to fix?"
