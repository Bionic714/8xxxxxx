The seventh and final "Road" movie with Crosby, Hope and (in essentially a cameo role) Dorothy Lamour. Joan Collins is the duo's comic foil and not at all into the "shtick" of these films. But many other things are way off too. Made a decade after the "Road to Bali," the picture features the comic duo looking much older and not doing much more than walking through the old routines. It's the one picture in the series not made at Paramount ... or even in the US. It was done in England. Peter Sellers has a lengthy cameo at the beginning of the film.Later David Niven turns up and a couple of Rat Packers crash the party the end. Mostly, the film is just a long fizzle. The laughs are few and far between and the film's intended spoof of the James Bond spy film genre rarely pays off.
