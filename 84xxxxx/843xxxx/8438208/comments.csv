But why waste their bandwidth when there are better distribution networks for sponsored media (aspecially considering this is a way to get a bunch at once)

When available, I used the divx/xvid option at highest quality, otherwise I used the mp4 (still highest), so if the torrent is dying you can always download some episodes from there and revitalize it."
