,rassouli5,2013-05-05T18:58Z,@peyotlman This version of StageLight doesn't even have a demo! 
,peyotlman,2013-05-06T10:36Z,I have installed this version and it say it is an 30 day working demo and after that you have to buy a key.
,rassouli5,2013-05-06T14:54Z,"@peyotlman Damn it >:(

I wasn't able to instal it because my laptop doesn't have enough ram for this!"
,Napoleon7,2013-05-07T06:37Z,"Dude! Thanks a lot! I just brought this for $14.00 after downloading and and finding out it was a  demo version. People! Everyone claims that you can make music easy with their software, NOT! But, with StageLight you can actually make beats that sound good. "
