A few months ago, Linkin Park introduced StageLight; a new, easy way to create music. With the Linkin Park Edition of StageLight, you're given hundreds of exclusive sounds from Linkin Park's personal library to help you create your own unique music. The Linkin Park Edition is available on The Pirate Bay. StageLight is designed to be used by musicians at all levels. Beginners need not be afraid.
