Protect your digital photos with uMark. uMark is a powerful batch watermarking software. It enables you to add visible watermarks to your digital images and photos. Be it your company name, logo, copyright notice or EXIFproperties - uMark can add all! You can set a custom font and color, adjust opacity level and transparency, and insert special characters like ┬⌐ and ┬«. The watermark can be placed anywhere on the image, using customizable presets or exact x/y positioning.

uMark supports multiple image formats and lets you convert your images from one format to the other. With uMark you can also rotate and tile your watermarks. Once you have designed your watermark, you can save the settings for later use. uMark can add itself to the Windows Explorer right click context menu for images so that you can add watermarks to the images directly from Windows Explorer. uMark saves watermarked images in a separate folder so your originals remain unchanged.
