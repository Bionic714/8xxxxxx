A unique and comprehensive explanation of serial murder, this book draws on the years of dedicated research of Dr. Julie B. Wiest. The book examines connections between American culture and the incidence of serial murder and draws clear and well supported conclusions. Dr. Wiest presents six empirically supported arguments that have the potential to revolutionize how serial murder is understood, studied, investigated, and brought to light, including a sociological context as to why most identified serial murderers are white males. This text is suitable as a reference as well as a textbook for serial murder, serial violence, and criminal profiling courses.
