Scam school.

Neat tricks to scam free drinks (or as the host, Brian Brushwood calls it "social engineering")


In case of no seeders; They can also be downloaded from http://revision3.com/scamschool/episodes

But why waste their bandwidth when there are better distribution networks for sponsored media (aspecially considering this is a way to get a bunch at once)

When available, I used the divx/xvid option at highest quality, otherwise I used the mp4 (still highest), so if the torrent is dying you can always download some episodes from there and revitalize it.
