,FastxNxDeadly,2013-05-08T05:34Z,"Thanks for the upload -- I hope this Torrent get more seeders soon.

For anybody who is thinking about getting this:
GET IT. I downloaded one and it wasn't Version 1046. Everyone plays on 1046... I'm not kidding.
Putting in the patch on other people's uploaded games do NOT work. So hopefully more seeders come on this one.

Thanks-- Like KiiBa said.. Be patient and this will have many Seeders in no time."
