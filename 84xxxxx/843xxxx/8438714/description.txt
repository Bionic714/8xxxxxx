Bio Excerpt from All Music:

The Dovells are best known for a handful of early-'60s dance hits, including their biggest one -- "The Bristol Stomp" -- number one (according to Cash Box) and number two (Billboard) on the pop charts in 1961, climbing its way to number seven on the R&B charts as well. They went on to have four more dance hits, three of which charted in the Top 40, giving them five different charters to five different dances in a little over a year during 1962, including "Do the New Continental" (number 37), "Bristol Twistin' Annie" (number 27), "Hully Gully Baby" (number 25), and a Top 100 charter, "The Jitterbug" (number 82).

Album Review:

Philadelphia's Dovells, led by singer Len Barry, grafted a doo wop vocal approach to light frat rock/R&B backing to create their own little genre, fueled by their ability to come up with a song to fit just about any dance craze that hit in the early '60s. Their biggest hits, "Bristol Stomp" and "You Can't Sit Down," are instantly recognizable, even if hardly anyone can come up with the name of the group that did them. This two-disc, 64-track collection has perhaps more Dovells than anyone could ever need, and if it gets a bit repetitive at times, it also shows a resolute group struggling and adapting to stay in step with the times. The above two hits are here (this set actually includes the entire You Can't Sit Down album), along with tracks that sound like the Beach Boys ("Dragster on the Prowl"), the Four Seasons ("What in the World's Come Over You"), Southern soul ("Little White House"), or a vocal group auditioning for Motown ("Lockin' Up My Heart"). In between are countless ramshackle, doo wop-inflected R&B songs that make up in energy what they lack in sophistication. Again, this is probably more Dovells than most people would ever need, but they're so much fun that this collection works even when it really shouldn't.
