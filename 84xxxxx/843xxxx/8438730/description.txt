All Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

The Knockouts and the Genies were doo-wop groups based in the New York/New Jersey area in the late '50s. They each had their biggest hit single -- The Knockouts' "Darling Lorraine," The Genies' "Who's That Knocking" -- in 1959, and followed it with a handful of similar-sounding releases. Neither group really had national fame, but they each made a couple of good records that should be of interest to hardcore doo-wop collectors. And that's the reason why this disc is of interest -- despite its uneven material, haphazard packaging and indifferent sound, it has a couple of gems from both groups that makes it worth seeking out.
