Doug Watkins Quintet ΓÇô 1960 - Soulnik (1994) FLAC

Bassist Doug Watkins only led two recording sessions before his death in 1962, and this set (which was cut for New Jazz and reissued on CD in the OJC series) has sometimes appeared under Yusef Lateef's name. Watkins doubles on cello (an instrument he had reportedly only begun playing three days earlier) during the set with Lateef (who triples on tenor, flute, and oboe), pianist Hugh Lawson, bassist Herman Wright, and drummer Lex Humphries. The quintet performs three standards, Watkins' "Andre's Bag," and a couple of Lateef tunes. The use of oboe and cello on some numbers makes the date stand out a bit from the usual hard bop sessions of the period and straight-ahead jazz fans will want to get this CD.
During the eight years between his arrival in New York city and his tragic death on an Arizona highway, Doug Watkins (1934-1962) was one of the most sought-after bass players in modern jazz and contributed to countless Prestige sessions. For his debut album as a leader, however, Watkins switched to cello. HeΓÇÖd borrowed the instrument only three days prior and actually played it for the first time at the date, yet his technical facility and melodic creativeness on it were as assured as is work on the larger axe. Down Beat reviewer John Tynan described the disc as a relaxed and free-blowing date vastly enlivened by the presence of Yusef Lateef, who doubled on flute and oboe.
