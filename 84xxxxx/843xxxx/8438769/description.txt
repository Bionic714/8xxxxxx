1. Talent Show -- 7th Season. This was one of the last live
shows done in between the filmed shows, and Jayne has a cameo.
Oh and it's a fake talent show!  A parody if you will (or even if you won't).

2. Jack goes on a cruise and dreams he meets Jayne Mansfield.

This 14th Season show was a remake of a live show in the public domain
with Marilyn Monroe some 10 years earlier. Marilyn was dead by then
so they got Jayne instead. Good move!  Also it saved money that week because
it was a recycled plot....
