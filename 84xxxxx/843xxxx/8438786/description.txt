First biography paragraph from All Music (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

After the Spinners and the O'Jays, the Stylistics were the leading Philly soul group produced by Thom Bell. During the early '70s, the band had 12 straight Top Ten hits, including "You Are Everything," "Betcha by Golly, Wow," "I'm Stone in Love With You," "Break Up to Make Up," and "You Make Me Feel Brand New." Of all their peers, the Stylistics were one of the smoothest and sweetest soul groups of their era. All of their hits were ballads, graced by the soaring falsetto of Russell Thompkins, Jr. and the lush yet graceful productions of Bell, which helped make the Stylistics one of the most successful soul groups of the first half of the '70s.

All Music Album Review (by Ron Wynn):

When the Stylistics switched to Amherst in the '80s, their glorious "sweet" soul hits were repackaged on a couple of collections. This was a singular set covering their finest '70s numbers; another package split them into a two-part release. It's slightly improved in sound quality over the 1975 The Best of The Stylistics, and hearing Russell Tompkins, Jr.'s quavering falsetto at any time is a treat.
