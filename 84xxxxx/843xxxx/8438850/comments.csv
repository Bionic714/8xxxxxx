the pirate bay doesn't allow anyone to put the letters C-0-M after the word F-R-E-E, so when i typed out the 4 words for FCBD, it deleted them! did the same thing to another torrent of mine. how ... random."

[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T13:56Z,"hey phoenix genesis, i just read your comment under an old post. very insightful! i think that in any business, publishing or otherwise, marketing and promotion is one of the most important tasks a company has -- and often the most screwed up, unfortunately.

but hey, as readers we take the good with the bad. we can help promote comics to the next generation all the time if we make an effort. support local comic shops, donate unwanted trades to a library, show a kid how to use comixology... we probably do a better job promoting marvel than marvel does!  :-)"
