,lapis22,2013-05-05T03:50Z,not Japanese audio it is actually Korean.
,magee89,2013-05-05T06:28Z,"This is Japanese audio with fucking fantastic subtitles, even the ending music is subtitled.

Best quality out there. Not HD but gotta be at least 480p, quality is perfect as far as I'm concerned. I'm currently seeding at 300/kbps, best I can do sorry.

Also best shippuden movie ever."
