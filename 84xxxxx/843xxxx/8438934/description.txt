The Duke of Darkness was Danny ΓÇ£PaddyΓÇ¥ Sullivan, a police officer from an unnamed American city. When he was killed in the line of duty, Danny discovered that he continued to exist as an "Earth-bound spirit." He decided to continue fighting crime as the Duke of Darkness.

His powers include intangibility, flight, super strength, and the ability to perceive & battle ghosts and demons. Even though he's a "ghost," he is able to be knocked out by a bump on the head such as in his first adventure. The Duke of Darkness battles villains such as Professor Evil and Mr. Slumber, who attack people through their dreams. A police captain whom Danny once served under viewed the Duke of Darkness as a very mundane nutcase and kept trying to lock him up. Although Danny could escape at any time, he humored his former boss in between solving crimes.
