No. If you not trust - delete game and download other."

because of closed antivirus.

,DJ_DU2CE,2013-05-08T23:25Z,"Okay, thx bruss, no it works. But one big problem I have! The skins! I put all /materials/models/weapons (and /models/weapons and so on for the skins) in the custom Bruss.Ru folder ... but If I join a server, it loads and loads... but it´s not starting? Why!? And I have also skins for particles and so on, and I also put this folders in /custom/Brussorg.ru 
The game is starting but when I join a server...  loading loading loading.. after 30 min no changes!"
[T],bruss.aka.durka9,2013-05-09T01:22Z,"to DJ_DU2CE
Not all server permit using custom skins and other non standard content.
First, you must enter sv_pure -1 in console.
Second, connect to server who have sv_pure -1 or allow your content."
