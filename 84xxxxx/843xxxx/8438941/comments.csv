Grazie for the ul!"
,xenoFLASH,2013-05-05T03:40Z,"Today is May 4th. Also called 'May the Fourth'.
You lose your nerd license if you don't say this all day to everyone you meet. :)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-05T04:20Z,"Nooooooo it's not my bad pun! That's what Dark Horse called this. I promise!

They actually have a sale going on today for a butt-load of digital SW comics (and I think they're All Ages comics), and this was packaged in the bundles."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-05T04:22Z,"and yeah xenoFLASH, my wife told me about this earlier. she kept saying May the Fourth is Star Wars day. i said no it's FCBD. she said ""huh?""  :-)

also, $4 margaritas at the restaurant tonight for Cinco De Mayo weekend!"
,marvelnerd76,2013-05-05T05:21Z,sounds interesting...who am I kidding? if it's got Star Wars in the title I'm reading it. Thank for the upload. 
,smokey8,2013-05-06T08:37Z,May the 4th is actually a pretty common star wars thing. I'm surprised people didn't know about it. 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-06T18:40Z,"i loved star wars in the 80s and 90s but the expanded universe is so... well, expanded that i can't keep track of most of it.  :-)

the wikipedia page for star wars day says this may the 4th thing really caught fire in 2011. so 3 years..."
