An exclusive four-page digital preview of the highly anticipated comics adaptation of The Star Wars, George Lucas' original draft screenplay. Written three years before the 1977 film, this first vision of the galaxy far, far away introduces us to Jedi Annakin Starkiller, and General Luke Skywalker, as well as a six foot alien named Han Solo. Its a tale of fantastic adventures, daring escapes, "laser swords," and monsters, and is sure to read like no Star Wars you've known before!

May the 4th be with you!
