Lady Satan and her fiancé were victims of a German bombing while on a ship. It sunk, and her fiancé died, so Lady Satan took an oath to be the foe of the Nazis. Donning a mask and waltzing about in an evening dress, Lady Satan traveled unnoticed through the streets of Nazi occupied France as she fought the German invaders. In her third appearance she was a sorceress who fought against the occult instead of Nazis.
