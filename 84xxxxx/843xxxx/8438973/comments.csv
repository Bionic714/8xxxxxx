I've downloaded all of your torrents now, and they're always reliable!
I appreciate you taking the time to upload these!"
[V],QborT,2013-05-05T06:32Z,I figured with the state of affairs the world is in right now what we really need is anime involving humans being eaten by giant monsters to bring us all a little closer together.  Just spreading the love.

Thanks for another good torrent, I really appreciate what you're doing! "
,chakistar,2013-05-08T06:38Z,"Thanks QborT!

I'm buying the whole Attack on Titan series even if costs me an arm and a leg."
[V],QborT,2013-05-09T00:22Z,"chakistar, I'm pretty sure trading body parts for media still hasn't become acceptable (much like the act of media sharing).  You'll probably have better luck just using money, plus then you'll still have both arms and legs.

Also, no need to thank me.  All I do is share a little bandwidth.  All props go to [gg] for making these."
