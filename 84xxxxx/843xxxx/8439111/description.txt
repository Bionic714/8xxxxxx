This unnamed hero operated from underneath the 1939 New York World's Fair in an underground lab connected to an underground river. He guarded the Fair and fought those criminals and racketeers who threatened it.

He later became known as "Fantoman." The Fantom was strong enough to bend gun barrels and also possessed great speed. He was also a skilled hypnotist and could tamper with people's memories.
He was also very hard-boiled and quite willing to torture enemies to get what he wanted, dedicating a room in his hideout for a collection of medival torture devices. His activities quickly spread beyond the World's Fair.
