,marvelnerd76,2013-05-05T04:07Z,I appreciate these FCBD issues being put up! Thanks for all of your uploads! Loved your Iron Man graphic novel pack. 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-05T04:16Z,no problem-o marvelnerd76. did you like this cartoon/comic mash-together thing? my favorite panel is the one where hulk does a kick and the sound effect is KICK!
,marvelnerd76,2013-05-05T04:56Z,Marvel/Disney is needs to hire more editors or quality control. Cartoon looked promising but this comic is bringing down my excitement. Kids are gonna be offended by this.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-05T05:20Z,"yeah, i have to wonder if this was a way to get away with not hiring an artist, if the parent company owns the animation artwork already. bad form.

i'm not surprised this comes from an editor who was stephen wacker's assistant editor.  :-)"
,marvelnerd76,2013-05-05T05:44Z,I do have to give it some credit for making me laugh...Red Hulk giving a Booyah battle cry....almost had soda coming out of my nose...sound effects are priceless 
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-05T13:03Z,"yeah that's some goofy, fun stuff. i think the cartoon will probably be a good thing. (unfortunate that the red hulk in the comics is in a mature readers book, and there's no she-hulk or skaar books that could receive a bump.)"
