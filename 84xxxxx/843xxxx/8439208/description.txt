Great job pissing away the annual opportunity to actually put out a good FCBD kids' offering. They couldn't even write a proper sales text for freecomicbookday.com ("It's out action...") And I know you get what you pay for, but perish forbid the #1 company in the U.S.A. creates some new comic fans...!  --STFmaryville
