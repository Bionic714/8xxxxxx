Free sewing patterns are a great resource for those learning how to sew, especially easy patterns with uncomplicated stitches and minimal measuring. This sewing eBook includes 20 different free sewing patterns from super-simple to intermediate, including pillows, clothing and bags. Because every sewer needs a pincushion or two, we start off this collection with three unique pincushion crafts. Pincushions are a great way to use up scrap fabric and add a little color to your sewing room.
