,xenoFLASH,2013-05-05T04:41Z,"Oh, yeah. That's the stuff."
,marvelnerd76,2013-05-05T05:09Z,Even more? Awesome!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-05T05:24Z,"also hope to see scans of judge dredd classics from idw, the worlds collide tie-in (sonic vs. mega man) from archie, and the avatar offering, a mature readers title written by christos gage!"
,Ahlat,2013-05-05T18:43Z,Thank you STFmaryville. Is piracy considered illegal if the product was free originally?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-06T03:39Z,"as i understand it, no. it must take profit away from the owner (in this case, publisher)."
,longxdivision,2013-05-09T17:38Z,Any word on that Judge Dredd issue?
