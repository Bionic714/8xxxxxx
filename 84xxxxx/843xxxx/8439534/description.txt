Contains:

TRIBAL WARFARE - The original "Age of Reptiles" series, four issues, published in 1993.

THE HUNT - The second series, five issues, published in 1997.

THE JOURNEY - The third series, four issues, published in 2009.

THE BODY - A short story published in "Dark Horse Presents" in 2011.

As luck would have it, everything but the short was recently re-released in an omnibus trade volume, so the "collecting" was a rather minuscule affair in this case. Heh.
