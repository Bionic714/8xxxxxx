I guess you never saw the re-scans done by ""theProletariat-DCP"" (at 1680px) - those were perfect!"

My pleasure.

And you guessed rightly - cheers for the pointer! Whichever non-digital scan I had before downloading this Empire version, it wasn't anywhere near as good as theProletariat's. Now, I can't quite decide which one I like better: This one has better definition (despite the lower resolution), as per the norm for digital versus non-digital versions, but that one has considerably more sumptuous colouring. Bah. :P"
