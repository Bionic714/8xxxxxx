Rod Reilly, son of a millionaire steel tycoon Ed "Emerald" Reilly, was bored of his playboy lifestyle, so he decided to become a crime fighter. Assisted by Slugger Dunn, his ex-prize-fighter valet and best friend, Firebrand used his fighting prowess and skills with a lariat to fight crime. He also has vacuum cups for climbing the buildings in New York. He was engaged to Joan Rogers, a wealthy socialite.

During his early adventures, Firebrand was wanted by police for crimes he did not commit. Like many other heroes, he left a signature item wherever he stopped crimes - in his case, it was a lit torch.

Notes

    While the golden age version of Firebrand is public domain, all subsquent versiosn used by DC comics are NOT. DC Comics used the character briefly in the mid-1980s in All-Star Squadron. Eventually, Reilly's sister took up the name and costume, after finding she had fire-based costumes.
    DC has also used the name for another hero, not related to the above one, in 2008's "Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters".
