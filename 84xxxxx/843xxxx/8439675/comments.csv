,sextits,2013-05-08T08:15Z,"hmmm Portable Ops just goes to black screen right after snake starts talking in opening cutscene :(

does this work for anyone else or is this game confirmed not to work?? Or is there an updated version coming soon?? This is honestly the only psp game i want to play, and have been wanting to play forever and could nolt justify buying a psp for only one game, id buy it on psn but i think those are actually psp games, they need to explain there shit, it pisses me off and now i get to fuckin cutscene opening and fucking black screen, ffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"

,celol619,2013-05-12T06:49Z,"I made a mistake. Prinny save works, but only on internal HDD. All psp games works on external hdd too, but anyone saves. Games which save are essencial, install on internal hdd."
,jayyroxx,2013-05-19T18:03Z,"Anybody made Monster Hunter to run ? 
Im still stuck, thank you.
