                                Release Notes 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Here we go with another pack for you, some are Remasters and others are Mini's 
but all work 100%. I tried to use PSP Remastering with all new games first due to 
the upscaling and full screen capabilites but if that failed I fell back on the old method 
as it would make some games work unlike the PSP Remaster PKG's. I am trying to do 
as many request as you guys send to me but some simply do not work. So I will keep 
trying as methods evole so if you don't see the game you want now there are 73 now 
you can play (two were repacked but now fixed, sorry. One had to be PSP Remastered 
the other was a hiccup making the last PKG file) anyhow I am well on my way to pack 4 
so it will be up soon after this completes. So Till then I hope you enjoy!! Also on Remasters 
open your XMB duuring a game and go to settings and choose "Game Settings" and turn 
on the upscaling as well as full screen for Remasters. 

All retain their orignal Content ID given by Sony so 
no conflicts will happen during install and all can be installed at one time no 
problems there. Saves work on all games and test using Rebug 4.30.2 CFW but will 
work on any CFW. 

I have been told however 3.41 & 3.55 saves will not work but 
any 4.XX CFW they will save just fine. I made this pack as I had so many I 
needed to catch up and by the time this is seeded hopefull the next pack will be 
ready. So stick with it and you will get some great games to play on your PS3.

                                              ##Notes## 

Monster Hunter Freedom Unite - PSN PKG used so freeze is gone and all  extra downloads/quest work from game even on banned PS3. 

The 3rd Birthday - Loads to a black screen simply press X button to get into the game and works flawlessly after that. 

Ultimate Ghosts'n Goblins - PSP Remasterd to fix the 2x speed that happens when converted to a Mini. If anything it runs a tad slow and removing full screen option seems to help get it "just right" but hopefully the updates to the emulators in 4,41 OFW will fix a lot of these issues and maybe we could even "inject" into a 4.30 etc. CFW like we do to disable Cinavia. 

Star Ocean First Departure - Still a "Mini" but it does not black screen anymore. Not sure what happened with the re-PKG'ing after updating art as it worked on my PS3. Anyhow it is fixed and working now. 

Metal Gear Games - All have 3D enabled 

Tales of the World - Radiant Mythology - Was converted from a "Mini" to a "Remaster" version and now it works all the way through after character creation. 

Castlevania The Dracula X Chronicles - Has GFX glitching when the level loading signs come up but during actual game play it run flawless. So nothing will effect the actual game play at all. Just a little lag like on the Dreamcast with Echelon's rip of Skies of Arcadia if anyone recalls that. I have also patched out the border when Symphony of the Night is unlocked. This is how it was programmed but thanks to helpful folks I wa sable to patch it out. Now if it works I do not know as I have not had enough time to make it that far but I did decrypt and and re-sign the binary so in theory the two other unlockable games should be just fine.
