Otherworld
----------

Otherworld is an erotic business management/stat raising flash game, similar in design to Slave Maker, Sim Brothel and Whore Master. 

The player is first given their choice of background, assistant, and what goals they wish to pursue in life (which decides the conditions that must be met to "win" the game.) Once these decisions are made, the player works to make money by buying girls at auction, training them to improve desirable stats and then reselling the improved girls for a profit. 

There are several shops to visit, selling a wide variety of items to aid the player in their training. In addition, the player may undertake quests set to him by various NPC's in the game that can be rewarded with money, items, or even unique girls.
