First biography paragraph from All Music (by John Bush):

Richard Newell grew up in Canada listening to the blues. He learned to play the harmonica as a teenager and joined the Barons in 1961, releasing a single called "Bottleneck." In 1966, Newell left the band (then renamed Son Richard and the Chessmen) to join the Midknights, but then began playing with Ronnie Hawkins, who nicknamed him King Biscuit Boy. After playing with Hawkins for two years, he joined Crowbar and released Official Music (as King Biscuit Boy & Crowbar) in 1970. He recorded solo material sporadically throughout the '70s and '80s (including 1982's Mouth of Steel and Richard Newell A.K.A. King Biscuit Boy in 1988). Poor health due to alcoholism stunted his career through the 90's and on January 5, 2003 Newell succumbed to the disease at his home in Hamilton, Ontario.

All Music Album Review (by Keith Pettipas):

Born in Hamilton Ontario, Richard Newell's musical career began in the early 60's as a teenager playing the harmonica in teen bands, theBarons in 1961 (later renamed Son Richard and the Chessmen) and then with the blues styled Mid- Knights in the mid 60's. He became noticed while playing with Ronnie Hawkins as one of the Hawks, who nicknamed him King Biscuit Boy. After playing with Hawkins for two years, he left to go it alone but joined Crowbar band made up of ex Hawks) and recorded his debut album entitled Official Music (as King Biscuit Boy & Crowbar) in 1970. Official Music was released on the Daffodil Records label in Canada and Paramount in the U.S.A. to critical acclaim . Of the eleven songs on the album, eight are standard blues covers of songs by such greats as Willie Dixon, Bill Broonzy, Otis Redding,Sonny Boy Williamson, given a unique treatment by Newells' harmonica playing. There are also original compositions written by Newell and performed in a classic blues style. Official Music charted in both the US and Canada and a single taken from the album,"Corinna Corrina" was a minor hit in Canada for King Biscuit Boy and Crowbar in 1970. After the release of Official Music, King Biscuit Boy and Crowbar parted ways. This budget priced reissue by Unidisc does not contain any bonus tracks but faithfully reproduces the original album graphics and liner notes.
