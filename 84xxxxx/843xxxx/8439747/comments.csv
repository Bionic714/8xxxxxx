Didn't you think about getting current and using x264 (AVC) codec instead of XviD?
It would cut the file size in half. There is x265 (HEVC) codec on the market already, so x264 is quite old, but widely used in the industry."

,Muhfucka,2013-05-11T04:08Z,Something like a 700 mb 480p x264 would be the bomb. But thanks.
,Muhfucka,2013-05-11T04:09Z,guldkrona you can play x264 on your computer for free. Download the K-Lite codec pack.
[T],skJGZV6z,2013-05-12T09:07Z,"Yeah thanks for the feedback, on the format choices:

These choices all stem from my hardware availability and input signal characteristics. Xvid isn't the most efficient kid on the block anymore, but it has become the lowest _common_ denominator available (easy play for all). And it suits the limited quality of the content just fine.

That said, all of this will change someday, when I get better hardware (both input and output)."

Who the h*ll want to watch tv shows and movies on the computer? I want to be able to play it on my tv."
