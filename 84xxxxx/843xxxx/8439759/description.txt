In this biographical portrait, California-based pastor Greg Laurie tells the story of how he came to find God in his own words, tracing his transformation to a life-changing encounter with a group of young Christians in high school. Since that day, he's gone on to spread the word to thousands of others through his Harvest Christian Fellowship mega-church as well as the church's Harvest Crusades ministry. 

Lost Boy is a story of redemption. It has been honored with awards at eight international film festivals. The film shows how God saved a young man whose mother was married and divorced seven times before he was eighteen, and has used him in a mighty way to reach millions of people since then.
