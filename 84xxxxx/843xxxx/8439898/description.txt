 : Web frameworks are playing a major role in the creation of today's most    :
 : compelling web applications, because they automate many of the tedious     :
 : tasks, allowing developers to instead focus on providing users with        :
 : creative and powerful features. Java developers have been particularly     :
 : fortunate in this area, having been able to take advantage of Grails, an   :
 : open source framework that supercharges productivity when building         :
 : Java-driven web sites. Grails is based on Groovy, which is a very popular  :
 : and growing dynamic scripting language for Java developers and was inspired:
 : by Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.                                            :

 : Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon is the first introductory book on the :
 : Groovy language and its primary web framework, Grails.  Griffon is also    :
 : covered. While Grails is the Web framework for building Groovy Web         :
 : applications, Griffon is the deskop framework for building desktop Groovy  :
 : applications.  Could Groovy be the new Java?  It's light, fast and free    :
 : (open source).                                                             :

 : This book gets you started with Groovy, Grails and Griffon, and culminates :
 : in the example and possible application of some real-world projects. You   :
 : follow along with the development of each project, implementing and running:
 : each application while learning new features along the way.                :
