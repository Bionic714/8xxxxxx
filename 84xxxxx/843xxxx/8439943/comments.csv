,hopedeny,2013-05-05T21:28Z,you people know that this game was released by the devs and its broken intentionally right?
[T],The_Duck1,2013-05-05T21:51Z,What OS do you have?
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T07:13Z,"I just deleted the Game Dev Tycoon folder from ""C:UsersyournameAppDataLocal"" before installing this game and I received an achievement in game for buying the game.

I'll comment in a few hours with a screenshot letting everyone know if it's real or fake."
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T08:37Z,"Alright, just played for a bit, I got this message, which I got the first time I played the game, too.

Then I got the message about someone making mods for my game, which I got last time too.

Then, just when I thought I was doing well, BOOM.

Yep, this is the copy of the game with the anti pirate message. I'll try a couple more, because I'd like to play the game all the way through before purchasing it as soon as it becomes available on Steam. If I cannot do that, I won't be buying the game at full price."
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T08:39Z,"And to think The_Duck1 doesn't only have a pink emblem, but also has uploaded torrents to TPB for 2+ years. Oh well."
,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T08:41Z,"This is a broken copy. I received this pop up after a short time playing the game.

,Metalzulu,2013-05-06T23:53Z,"I appologize for the comments. If you receive a message saying people are playing an ""illegal"" copy of your game and not ""pirated"" copies, your copy is good. I'm sorry The_Duck1! D:"
