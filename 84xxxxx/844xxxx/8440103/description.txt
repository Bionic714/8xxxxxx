The Seven Sisters were always present, and almost always came out on top.

Since that notorious meeting at Achnacarry Castle on August 28, 1928, they have never ceased to plot, to plan and to scheme. At the end of the 1960s, the Seven Sisters, the major oil companies, controlled 85 percent of the world's oil reserves. Today, they control just 10 percent.   

But they would not have counted on the rise of a new, strong and hungry China, with an almost limitless appetite for oil and energy. Today, the US, Russia and China contest the control of the former USSRΓÇÖs fossil fuel reserves, and the supply routes. A three-handed match, with the world as spectators, between three ferocious beasts ΓÇô The American eagle, the Russian bear, and the Chinese dragon
