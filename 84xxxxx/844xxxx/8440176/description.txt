When it comes to bad anime reviewing I've seen and listed all of the fallacies. The Sage avoids all of these and instead takes the harder yet more virtuous path of avoiding bias and sophistry; the payoff of his choice is immense and well deserved. The lines he speaks, his neither dour nor furious demeanour and talent for finding logical flaws in the anime he reviews make for an excellent combination.
