This is not a book about advanced SQL. It is not a book about the Oracle optimizer and diagnos-
tic tools. And it is not a book about relational calculus, predicate logic, or set theory. This book is
a SQL primer. It is meant to help you learn Oracle SQL by yourself. It is ideal for self-study, but it
can also be used as a guide for SQL workshops and instructor-led classroom training.
