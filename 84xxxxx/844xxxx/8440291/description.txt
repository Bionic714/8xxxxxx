Dr Andrew McLeod is a recently widowed academic who researches alternative religion. Following the death of his wife, he moves to a new post in Edinburgh. During his studies, he comes across an ancient book the "matrix aeternum". The narrative moves forward at a cracking pace, with a mysterious cult, its leader an Edinburgh solicitor, the action moving from Scotland to North Africa and back again.

Truly gripping and streets ahead of Stephen King. One o9f the best book serialisations I've heard in a long time.
