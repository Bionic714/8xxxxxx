--------------------
This will fix a variety of Google Play, Google Talk related errors, like authentication errors, RFC errors and will reset the primary Google account.


Get rid of Primary Account, use ES file explorer, 
Enable Root Explorer and Mount R/W.  Go to local, then up to root folder, click the data folder, click the system folder.

Hold down the left click on accounts.db, choose delete.

Go to Settings, Applications, Manage
Go to the ALL tab at the top.

Scroll down to
Google Play Services
Click ""clear data"" button

Go back and repeat for the following:
Google Play Store
Google Services Framework
Talk
Talkatone
Download


Restart BlueStacks by right-clicking the system tray icon, and choose restart.

Open GMAIL, add your Google account!

Enjoy!

,js99912,2013-05-10T04:43Z,"Try using ES task manager and killing all running tasks.  Bluestacks provision 768MB RAM, you need to free some.  You can increase it to 851MB in the by modifying the registry key memory at
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/BlueStacks/Guests/Android

Set the value of MEMORY to decimal 960, then you get 851MB, I dunno why 960, but it works.

,js99912,2013-05-13T04:05Z,"hmm, we are not able to recreate that issue..  After loading BlueStacks, go into task manager and kill any HD-whatever processes, and load the addon again.

the SD version has limited app support because of ARM, but what it does run, it's very fast!
