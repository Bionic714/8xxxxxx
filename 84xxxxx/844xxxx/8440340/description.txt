Welcome to Android for Windows 2.0

This is a complete Android 2.3.4 running environment that runs on Microsoft Windows.  We have taken the hard work of the developers, simplified things and implemented all of tips and tricks in one robust, powerful and fully 
complete operating system.  We at Trip9d0zen are proud to pass on all of that development to the end-user.

Account Setup
-------------
..Sign up for a Google account and Voice number by googling /google voice/.  You will get to pick out a phone number pretty much anywhere in the US. If you wish to create a brand new Google ID, this would be the time.  The biggest pain is remembering ones many Usernames/Passwords and signing everything in.  
..Launch Android for Windows, Sign in to everything, it does run
better after your accounts have synced and settled down.
..Sing in to Google Play, GMAIL, FB/Twitter
..Create accounts/Sign in to Dropbox, box, Google drive and SkyDrive

Icons
-----
Quit BlueStacks.  To get the More realistic Android Icons for Home, Back, etc, got to the TOOLSImages folder, Select all and copy.  Go to C drive , programfilesx86 or just programfiles if you donΓÇÖt have one. Right click on BlueStacks and Paste, when asked to Overwrite and at permission say yes.

Virtual Keyboard and X-Mouse included in tools.

DRAWBACKS
---------
This is not a good Video Player.  Youtube works OK but you may have to 
UNCLICK HD everytime. Play Videos in the Windows environment, 
COPY/PASTE links in and out of android using SlamHammerSmith.exe.  
Best of both worlds, sort of the beauty of it.

Enjoy
