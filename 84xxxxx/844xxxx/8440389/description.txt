The New Blood series have been a showcase of consistent growth and musicianship within Hospital Record's sister label Med School - a label set up to give intelligent, intricate and underground electronic music a platform from which to shout. Previous years have seen the inclusion of now household names sitting alongside equally talented but lesser-known artists, each release offering the best in new, breakthrough bass-driven dance music. From the outset of Anile's haunting "Another year" to Barefoot's chilled dubstep in "Rising & Falling"; rising star Etherwood's beautiful "Unfolding" to Mr Sizef's crisp electronics in "The Second Before Snow Turns Into Water", this LP has all the Med School hallmarks fans will be searching for. Worth a purchase to simply to hear something outside of the ordinary. Long live Med School.
