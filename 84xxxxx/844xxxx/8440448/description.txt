Still in 1971, Vangelis played several sessions in the London Marquee Studios, some of them together with guitarist Argyris 'Silver' Koulouris, violinist Michel Ripoche, bass guitarist Brian Odger and drummer Mick Waller. For some reason the recordings were never released at the time, and lay shelved until 1978, when Charly Records suddenly released the music under the name 'The Dragon'. Apparently this release wasn't approved by Vangelis, as he successfully went to court to get the album off the market.
