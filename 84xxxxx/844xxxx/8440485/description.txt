As a child, Rano is separated from her family; her parents long dead, her elder sister raped and murdered, and her brother mistakenly believed to have died on that same terrible night. Rano is raised by a smuggler and grows up to be a thief. Her life of crime leads her to Dr. Ashok Roy, who believes patience and love can cure criminals. But Detective Raj Kumar is also on Rano's trail, and he believes in merciless justice. But what neither realizes is that he is also her long lost brother.
