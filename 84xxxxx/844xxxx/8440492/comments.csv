,HDRoy,2013-05-11T22:06Z,"It would be pretty much amazing if you uploaded R126, a thousand thank you's for this!"
,xist646,2013-05-12T04:26Z,"If I use this to try out the software, will my save (capx) be able to transfer over to the latest builds if I buy a license?"
,LavaWave,2013-05-12T08:58Z,"This hacked license cannot work with any version above R119, so sorry and I couldn't find another hacked license anyway

Xist646 I suppose if you build your game with R119 it should work on any version above R119 of Construct 2 without problems"
,Leechers_gonna_leech,2013-05-16T08:23Z,"i found R126 license. but encrypted with RAR Password which can be unlocked through survey and shit. i have no luck with those surveys. i am brute forcing to unlock it. if i got it and really works, i'll tell you guys."
,LavaWave,2013-05-16T18:04Z,"@Leechers_gonna_leech Don't bother, over 95% the ones with survey's are fake and/or scam, I've found many of those sites which are there only for the poor guy to end up paying for them to receive nothing in the end"
,yr937,2013-05-26T21:41Z,"license for r130 (tested not to work with r132, not tested with any lower releases)

(pastebin site)/qm2PBwD9

it should go without saying, feel free to update this torrent with the file :)"
,yr937,2013-05-26T21:50Z,"not sure if my other comment showed up, but the license file is on pastebin and tpb doesn't allow me to post URL's :("
,LavaWave,2013-05-28T09:39Z,"Thanks, I'l give it a shot :D"
,LavaWave,2013-05-28T10:01Z,"It works, I'l put it up soon :D"
