,V8_Man,2013-05-05T19:47Z,I'd never be able to see these without you... Many many thanks
,geenotreally,2013-05-06T11:43Z,"Thank for the quick upload smcgill1969. Could you verify if this is an upscaled iPlayer stream capture like your earlier upload Motogp.20130421.USA.Race.720p.mp4 ?
""***NB: Due to channel swapping by the BBC I did not manage to record this from a satelite broadcast, rather from the iPlayer service - There was no HD broadcast so this has been upscaled, it's OK to watch though... ***"""
,geenotreally,2013-05-06T12:06Z,"sorry, did not mean to sound like a prissy, just wanted to confirm if it was an HDTV or iPlayer rip (which looks washed out on the 5 year old 64in plasma). "
,smcgill1969,2013-05-06T12:21Z,"@geenotreally - No, it's a full on HD capture. For some reason the BBC seems to bump MotoGP in favour of other sports sometimes & this screwed up my series link for the USA race... :(
"
,geenotreally,2013-05-06T12:57Z,Thank you for the quick reply sir. I prefer beeb to OneTV.
