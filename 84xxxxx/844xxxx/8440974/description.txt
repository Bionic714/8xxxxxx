NOTE - MP3s of "A Lover's Concerto" and Bach's "Minuet in G" have been included in the torrent so that viewers may hear them in context with the famous scene in the film when Mr. Holland explains the Ionian mode. I have included the original 1965 Toys version, and the (much better!) recent Kelly Chen version.
