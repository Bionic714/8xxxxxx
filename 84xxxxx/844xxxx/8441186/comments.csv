AVG says its clean. 15 mins download and smaller than GOG. Loaded in so far, but haven't tested for bugs.

It's version FEZ 1.04, so it should include bug fixes. GOG FEZ 1.0 save files work just fine. Didn't even have to move the files."
,RBPM,2013-05-06T04:22Z,its works perfect thanks!!
,ffhighwind,2013-05-06T10:41Z,Gamepad works now.... may require a reboot after installing I guess. Had some OpenAL errors on loading this time but that may be related to my hard drive.
,CyKo74,2013-05-07T13:06Z,in changelog it says it's a Version 1.02
,skhsic,2013-05-08T04:19Z,"cant get it to work with windows 7 64bit, crashs at start up! 

Does anyone make it ?"
,Krolnite,2013-05-08T06:35Z,"Does anyone know if this fixed the bug where on intel graphics cards it just crashes on launch?

Or if any version of the game so far fixes that."
,etogatz,2013-05-08T20:27Z,"@Krolnite
This version works perfectly for me on Intel HD  2000 (Celeron G530 CPU)."
,Krolnite,2013-05-08T21:46Z,"@etogatz

Thanks for the info. t"
,skhsic,2013-05-08T21:58Z,"there was a problem with nvidia optimus, just fixed it. Now it is working perfect."
,Krolnite,2013-05-08T23:57Z,"Despite the fact it should be working fine it crashed on launch and then wouldnt even start up again.

So whatever bug is preventing it from working with my pc its still in the code."
,berithpy,2013-05-09T08:27Z,For the intel crash on start bug update your drivers! it may or may not fix your problems
,Trismogestos,2013-05-09T12:56Z,V1.05 is out! Ca someone upload it?
,Wroat,2013-05-12T18:19Z,Any chance of uploading v1.05?
,Zev747,2013-05-13T00:14Z,"Fez crashes during loading.  Does anyone have any SPECIFIC advice for how to fix this (not just ""update your drivers"" - I don't know which to update)?"
,FlyinCoco,2013-05-29T11:59Z,"crashed during start up. it just said the game has stopped working. using windows 7 64bit, using intel driver too"
