Six young men are sentenced to prison, forced to live in brutal, overcrowded conditions with a group of rough and macho cellmates. This is the story of their incarceration and their struggle to survive in the Brutewood Correctional hierarchy that would exploit each of them in their own way, pushing them into criminal and sexual exploits that they never thought they would agree to. The six inmates include tough gangsta Darren, wisemouthed redneck Marcus, ΓÇ£ex-gayΓÇ¥ preacher Rick, popular jock Talab, arrogant thug Victor and charming cholo Pablo, all of whom must learn to trust in each other and themselves in order to cope with the stresses of prison life.

ΓÇ£No HomoΓÇ¥ is erotic urban fiction, brimming with hardcore and kink-filled action. It is unique in that, despite its uncompromising and raunchy look at prison sexuality, there is no ΓÇÿgay sexΓÇÖ in the entire book ΓÇö that is, there is no act in this story whose participants consider themselves to have done something unambiguously gay. It is, however, jam-packed with man-on-man action and all the sexual humiliation that comes with being a straight guy in prison. This is a hard-hitting and gritty look at life behind bars, meant for mature readers only.
