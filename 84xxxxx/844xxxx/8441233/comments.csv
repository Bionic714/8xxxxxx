,Gusar19,2013-05-05T21:41Z,"Maddave. It is better all your life to believe in Jesus even He might be dead, than not to believe and at the end to find out He is alive. But then it will be too late and your destination of travel with one way ticket will be gate of Hell and eternal condemnation in lake of fire.Choice is yours"
