The Antlers - In the Attic of the Universe
------------------------------------------

Another re-encoded album from an lossless source. My thanks to SoundbaronPirateBay for his lossless upload.

This is in OGG VBR q9. The average bitrate is 304kbps, though it should sound of a better quality than that of an MP3 at 320kbps in CBR. I've got the album tagged, and provided a 1000x1000 JPG from a higher-res PNG on the web.

Great album by the way. It's from the time when The Antlers was only Peter Silberman. Have fun.
