Shakespeare's Globe On Screen: All's Well That Ends Well  (2013)

138 min.s in two files


This is my initial contribution to the Globe Theatre On Screen series of
Shakespeare performances.  The viewer will experience what a Shakespeare performance is like from the replicated Globe Theater in Britain.  

What you will not see is theatrical effect not available to the Sixteenth Century so far as technical artistry is concerned.  It is a bare stage with props.  There is no lighting effect except that which approximates daylight.  
 
In one production the audience in the orchestra area had on rain gear (in Much Ado About Nothing.)  I believe that the Globe is open at the top and that one can see rain falling on an area very near the stage.

The artifice of ensuing centuries is eliminated.  What is left is the 
costume and acting of the performers.  And what acting.  And what costumes.  The actors will be unfamiliar to those who do not follow the stars of Shakespearean theatre in Britain.  But that does not matter.  The pure delight in these performances-- mostly in the comedies for dvd's released-- will amaze the viewer.  

More of these Globe Theater productions are forthcoming.  As with other of my torrents from dvd I encourage those who can to get them for their libraries. They are available as Region One or 'Region Zero" releases.  But the torrent is also given for the wide range of countries who participate in the torrent community who may not have access to them.

Please consider maintaining (seeding) these Globe Theater performances in your own torrents.
torrent farm.
