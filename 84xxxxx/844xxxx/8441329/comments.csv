,hanksantana,2013-05-05T19:08Z,"Thank you so much. Without a hardcoded file, I would have no way of watching this amazing show. Please don't stop or I will never find out how it ends"
,kodomo_scales,2013-05-05T19:19Z,"lol. i promise to continue. i do requests too.  enjoy this episode, very jaw-dropping"
,hanksantana,2013-05-07T17:17Z,"episode was game of thrones style unbelievable. 
if you take requests, i have been searching everywhere for psycho pass with hardcoded subs so i can see what all the fuss is about. if you happen to have it, that would be one worth seeding"
[V],QborT,2013-05-07T18:12Z,"hanksantana -  There is lots of Psycho Pass on TPB already, obviously you haven't searched everywhere....

,hanksantana,2013-05-07T22:38Z,"QborT, thanks for trying to help, but I was saying I need a Psycho Pass with hardcoded subs on an avi or mp4. I know mkv is the thing easiest for most, but softcode subs disappear when I convert for my iPod format, and this uploader is the one person uploading anime with hardcoded subs."
,kodomo_scales,2013-05-08T18:09Z,"mm. il do do more hardcodes, i dont mind them at all and i think they look almost as good, i just like multi audio and as far as i know, you can only in mkv, but i have no problem doing hardcode requests"
,SCndZ_L8R,2013-05-25T11:49Z,"I wish to thank you for the upload.  Great show/ file quality, thanks a lot."
,PoxerPL,2013-06-05T01:36Z,"Please, man! Start uploading next episodes! Your uploads are great!"
