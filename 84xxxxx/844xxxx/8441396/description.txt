Marble Season
Publisher:  Drawn & Quarterly
Publication Date:  May 4, 2013

Created by:  Gilbert Hernandez

Drawn & Quarterly continues its FCBD tradition of offering the best free comic in the industry by publishing an exclusive excerpt of its lead Spring 2013 book by legendary alternative cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez of Love & Rockets fame. Marble Season is a semi autobiographical epic about a group of kids growing up in the 1960s seen through the eyes of a young boy. Comics and popular culture of the day will dominate the proceedings and tell the untold story of one of the medium's greatest and most respected artists. This FCBD has no nudity and no swearing and it will serve as a great preview for the upcoming book of the same name, which will be one of D+Q's lead titles of 2013.
