,FNatal,2013-05-06T02:34Z,"Game is crashing for me on a HD 7970 using latest WHQL drivers 13.4. It crashes right after the third part of the first stage where you need to collect blue enemies combos and yellow enemies, anyone else?"
,FNatal,2013-05-06T02:45Z,"For some reason my comment got deleted. The game is crashing for me right after the third part of the introduction level, anyone else?"
,lolocar,2013-05-06T03:40Z,"@FNatal I too got that problem... Running 6870, win 8 x64"
,tomkra,2013-05-06T09:58Z,"had to change the start in directory of the shortcut to Dyad from Dyadbin to get it to start but oh well, cheers sttiffy."
,tomkra,2013-05-06T10:10Z,"crashes also at 3rd stage, win7pro 64 bit, nvidia gtx680 with 314.22 drivers"
,jay_mail,2013-05-06T15:56Z,"i follow tomkra advice n to run this game smoothly (and to pass the 3rd level) you don't need to copy the crack to dyad folder. that's what i do. don't know about others. anyway, thanks stiffy"
,FNatal,2013-05-06T18:46Z,"Guys, confirming what @jay_mail previously said, in order to make the game work as it should do this:

1. Install the game
2. DO NOT apply the crack
3. Delete the shortcut originally created by the installation and create a new one from the game executable ""Dyad.exe""
4. Play the game :)

Now I'm past the third stage where it used to crash and everything is working as it should."
,tomkra,2013-05-07T08:56Z,"@FNatal cheers mate, works now."
