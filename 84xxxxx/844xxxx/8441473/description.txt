Shabab 1954 Vintage Hindi Classic 1CD DVDRip x264 MP3[TMB]

This film, made in the wake of the success of film "Baiju Bawra" has the main theme of music and power of music. It is the love story of a musician - a lost princess himself and a prince. The king and his stooges try to prevent their love from blossoming. The hero wins the heart of the prince and others but loses his life in the end.

The strength of the film is its music-sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammad Rafi, Mannade and Hemant Kumar. Nutan, the young heroine of the film lives the role of the prince at the same time looking charming. Bharat Bhushan repeats his good work of Baiju Bawra in this film also. Overall a good and thoroughly enjoyable film.
