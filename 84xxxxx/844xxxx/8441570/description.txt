Into The Cold--A Journey of the Soul retraces 
the personal and harrowing expedition of 
two men on foot to the North Pole in sub-zero 
temperatures to commemorate the centennial of 
Admiral Peary's reach in 1909. 

It is a journey of endurance and commitment into 
the depth of the soul against the backdrop of 
the magnificent, unforgiving 
and rapidly vanishing Great North.
