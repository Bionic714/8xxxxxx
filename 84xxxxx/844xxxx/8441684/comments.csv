[V],thetorrentlord,2013-05-21T02:31Z,Any chance you can finish seeding this torrent as no one can finish it (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8419497/Jericho_episodes_S01E08__S01E13___amp__S02E02_720p_WEB-DL_DD5.1).  It will allow everyone to have the full series in WEB-DL. We would really appreciate it.
