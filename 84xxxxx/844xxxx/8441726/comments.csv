,Dirtfrog399,2013-05-06T18:06Z,"I can capture the races in better quality by running the recording at night time. Whole Family is using internet during the live show and even my 40/40mbs Connection is not enough for HD. But that means later upload. 

I'll try that on the next one -  Brazil MXGP"

,RastaManZA,2013-05-07T13:46Z,Thanks again Dirtfrog for your work. I would personally wait a extra day or two for better quality.
