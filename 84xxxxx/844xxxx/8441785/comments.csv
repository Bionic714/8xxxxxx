[V],HighCode,2013-05-07T01:23Z,"Yes joegi50, you got sharp sight ;-)
This is how I backup my movies (on your hard drives lol)
And when a torrent is dying I bring it back to life, with your help of course.
""Rio Bravo 1959 BDRip 1080p multisub GER HighCode "" was completely dead and I lost my copy with a faulty drive but luckily I found it still active on a pvt site. I wish folks would keep torrents in seed longer time."
