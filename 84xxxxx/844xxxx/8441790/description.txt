Inspired by the food his Italian-American grandmother prepared, Isabella serves up 200 recipes for everyday meals that appeal to the heart and the appetite, with a modern twist. These ΓÇ£small platesΓÇ¥ versions of Mediterranean classics are food that's original and accessible, authentic without being fussy.
