Overview:
Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts have rather odd jobs: they give dying people another chance to live. Literally. Using a technology that allows artificial memories to be implanted, the doctors can weave and transform the mind of a patient to help them live the life they wanted to live...

To The Moon follows Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts' attempt to fulfill the wishes of a dying elderly man, Johnny. In their attempt to do so, they travel deep through the man's memories, unfolding his curious life story before their eyes. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny's past is revealed. As the two doctors piece together the fragmented events that spanned a lifetime, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish.

Johnny's last wish is, of course, to go to the moon.
