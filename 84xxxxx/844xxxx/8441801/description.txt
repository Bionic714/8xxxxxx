What's cool about it:
ItΓÇÖs a neo-noir sci-fi adventure that will take you across the galaxy.
Engage in dangerous shootouts and solve devious dialogue-based puzzles.
Take control of two different characters on the opposite sides of the galaxy.
Overview:
Azriel Odin, ex-assassin, arrives on the rain-drenched planet of Barracus. When things go horribly wrong, he can only seek help from the very criminals he used to work for. Meanwhile, across the galaxy, a man called Delta-Six wakes up in a hospital with no memory. Without knowing where to turn or who to trust, he vows to escape before he loses his identity completely. As fate brings these two closer together, youΓÇÖll discover a world where life is cheap, identities are bought and sold, and a quest for redemption can change the fate of a whole galaxy.

Gemini Rue will delight you with its moody background music, gritty atmosphere, and a story that will leave you thinking about the very nature of the human psyche and even free will. This is a must-have for classic pixel art, point-and-click adventure, and noir detective stories fans alike!
