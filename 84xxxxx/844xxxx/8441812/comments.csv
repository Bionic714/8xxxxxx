People like Finkelstein and Chomsky are true patriots of the USA and jews, unlike the supporters of Apartheid Israel (many of whom are not jews) like weapons manufacturers, who thrive on continuous occupation and war. No surprise the most fanatical supporters of Israel live in New York and Florida as well as Britain, Canada and Hungary, and would never consider moving to Israel.   "
