Mary, Mother of Jesus is a 1999 made-for-television Biblical film that retells the story of Jesus through the eyes of Mary, his mother. It stars Swedish actress Pernilla August and Melinda Kinnaman as Mary, David Threlfall as Joseph (his legal guardian, not father) and Christian Bale as Jesus. The film was produced by Eunice Kennedy Shriver and aired on NBC.

The film emphasizes Mary's importance in Jesus's life, suggesting that his parables were inspired by stories she told him in his childhood. This, and similar details about Jesus's upbringing, cannot be confirmed, but are certainly not impossible. The resurrected Jesus also appears to his mother privately. This event is not found in the Gospels, but is probably based on an ancient Catholic tradition (not official teaching) that he appeared to her first of all people. The tradition influenced Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises among others. The movie closes with Mary suggesting the disciples should start preaching about her son.
