The current edition contains Frank Rosolino's complete quintet recordings from his Los Angeles, June 1957 date, as well as all of the master takes from his Hollywood, December 22, 1958 quintet session. The alternate take of "There Is No Greater Love" from the latter date has also been added as a bonus track. Unfortunately, due to a lack of disc space, the session's other two alternate takes were not included here.
"My facility on the instrument is natural to a certain extent, but you have to develop it. You can't just say that a guy's a natural, and he gets up and just starts playing all the stuff. It's just from playing constantly. Every opportunity that I ever had in my life to play jazz, I would play... To be perfectly honest, I was never conscious of developing a particular style; it just turned out that that was my way of playing. Not that I haven't listened to other players - you have to, to learn anything about it in the first place. I leave myself open to listen to all players; even when I was younger, I just didn't listen to trombone players, period. For one thing, I've always thought in terms of playing like a tenor player - more so than like other trombonists." (Frank Rosolino)
