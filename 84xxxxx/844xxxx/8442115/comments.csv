Sorry, I do NOT have episode one, nor episodes three and four of this great show.  If anyone DOES
have it, I'd love to have them!  :-)

I hope people enjoy this show as much as I have.. I have not seen it anywhere at all, and was pretty lucky to find these.  Enjoy and KEEP SeEDING!!  I will personally set my ratio to at least 12/1 to give it a good start. "
