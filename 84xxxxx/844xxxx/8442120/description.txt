MixTape 1.2.10 Build 21.04.2013

MixTape is a very easy to use application that allows you to quickly import the tracks you already know and love by a simple drag and drop from iTunes.

Easy because beat matching is built in, accurate and works even with music that changes tempo. Easy to publish mixes onto the Internet or share between friends. Even easy to learn with screencast tutorials.

This is a minor update to the released Version 1.2.10. The developer included some bugfixes and cleaned up the code.

Have fun!
