There is a flatness to my voice that I am unhappy with. I need to improve it by resonating the tone in my chest. I have been trying to play the guitar again. I have gotten some of the piano back, but the guitar is frustrating. My hands naturally find the chords on the piano. And I have not figured out how to get my hands to work on the guitar again. I fight my hands to move to the chords instead of letting them go by themselves. It is so frustrating. I can barely get myself to pick up the guitar. And I still have the saxophone in the corner. And my trumpet. It is frustrating. Sometime ago I set all of my memories aside and it is frustrating trying to get back my music while not knowing what to do to get it back.
