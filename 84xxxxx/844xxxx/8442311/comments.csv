Just an FYI though: The file appears to be corrupted in some way, the most obvious place is about an hour and five minutes in where the video goes a distorted and sort of jumpy and cuts away. There's another place with a similar problem earlier, but I can't remember exactly where. Check it out. Maybe a fix?

Keep up the good work, you lot always upload the best stuff!"
