[V],YIFY,2013-05-06T03:00Z,"Previous 1080p upload was done with the commentary audio track. 
This was an accidental mistake. and this torrent is now fixed with the proper audio track.

No, we do not make these mistakes on purpose. 
We upload around 6 movies a day, its not possible to test every film we upload for our users. 
Never the less, sorry about any wasted internet traffic spent on previous faulty version"

,vwking,2013-05-06T22:50Z,"Bad quality.

@YIFY, why do you never show bitrate info?"
,SerSpec-V,2013-05-07T04:39Z,"@LiL_Crunk: Yes it has cinavia, you need to DL a DVDRIP. "
,firexninja,2013-05-07T04:54Z,thank you!
,NoQuints,2013-05-07T22:19Z,"Thanks YIFY. Downloaded the previous release, noticed the audio track, came here and you had already made things right."
,andyfukinj,2013-05-09T09:08Z,"Since all these fool spammers were talking shit on YIFY's uploads  ( My personal favorite uploader of good stolen movies) , I thought I would let everyone on here know there is actually a YIFY website out there you can download from. "

,xjun1or3,2013-05-10T21:57Z,this is 720p not 1080...
,Pmoney559,2013-05-10T22:30Z,Haters gon hate. Great job YIFY. A/V 10
,BD175,2013-05-11T02:04Z,"""Sick of YIFIs low quality rips destroying the TOP100 ""

Yes! They are low quality audio everytime (stereo) and typically the video quality doesn't match the claim, eg. 1080 looks more like 720 or even 480. There is zero point in having a 1.8GB 1080 rip and people who rate them A/V 10 clearly haven't seen real 1080 or heard 5.1+"
,alone302,2013-05-15T23:55Z,"Please tell me you have sound?
The fat fucks from cinavia ass-raped every version..."
,Des_troyy,2013-05-18T17:32Z,"Yes, this does have Cinavia on it. If you want a version without Cinavia on it, you must wait until a DVDRIP comes out. 

And yes, we know the audio isn't loud enough. That's what happens when a movie file is compressed to a size like this one. Its a audio for size sacrifice. Learn to deal with it. 

No one stops you from going out and wasting $20 for the real thing."
,Jamez80,2013-05-22T05:29Z,"Hoping to pick someones brain on the following

I play all my stuff through Windows Media Player on my XBOX 360. 

The XBOX does not like blu ray movies. I get audio but video never loads. 

Same thing on a few BR movies I've downloaded. 

I've messed around with Hand break but only seem to make the file even larger.

Does anyone know how to convert this BR movie using Hand Break into a format that the XBOX will play?

Is there an update that I can do on the XBOX? 

I have great disdain for the XBOX and would rather just have done with done with it and convert the BR to another format.

I appreciate any assistance :)"
,phuckstic,2013-05-31T00:22Z,"you can't give Yify 10's on video or audio...have you even downloaded a bigger file to see the difference?...his audio is garbage, hence the smaller file size so you idiots can watch on your little monitors you play video games on....

I remember when aXXo was loved and he pulled the same wool over your retarded eyes...

now without being biased...for claiming to be 1080p Yify should be fucking murdered without trial or jury

A: 5
V: 6"
