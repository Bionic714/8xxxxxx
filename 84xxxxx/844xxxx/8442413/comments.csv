,faraday0,2013-05-06T20:45Z,"remember to block the game in your firewall so your personal data doesn't get sent to dev.

,7117,2013-05-07T01:20Z,"what about Mac version, coz someone said under mac version you are asshole and seeding shit, is it true?"
,meciu,2013-05-07T02:41Z,"I am seeding FULL game, without this piracy sh!t, dowloaded from my order message (links to win, mac and linux versions)

Everything MUST be fine, clean old game data, install new version and block game in your firewall!"
,Thisnameistaken,2013-05-07T14:51Z,"STOP EVERYTHING! DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! WHY? 

BECAUSE IT FUCKING SUCKS!!!!!

It's not a game. It's a stupid piece of fucking shit. You just click some random buttons. 

First of all why are the first 2 things that happen when I start making my first game is I get 2 bugs? How can I have a bug in my game design when I don't even have any game designed yet to have bugs? Piece of fucking shit.

Also, your first few games CANT be good. Like what the fuck is that? That's fucking bullshit. 1 man, working in the 70's on a fucking text adventure, and produce an absolutely excellent fucking game. But according to this bullshit game thats impossible. Furthermore theres nothing you can do, no choices you can make to make sure your games turn out good. It's just random useless fucking bullshit. 

Do yourself a favor. Don't play this fucking pathetic excuse for a game."

,DreamPhreak,2013-05-08T18:23Z,"Works, really doesnt have the Piracy Bankrupt DRM. Proof: http://i.imgur.com/0XudUPD.png"
,danrman,2013-05-09T12:21Z,"The creator of this ""game"" did a sort-of-okay job, despite it just being a bit of randomized bullshit.
It fails at being a good tycoon game, and the whole ""anti-piracy"" version makes the developer seem like nothing but a money-hungry scumbag, and pretty much ruined any possible god perception I could have of this ""game""."
,Hikari4456,2013-05-10T08:25Z,Why can't I get the Secret Labs?! I already finished the game and is on the Y50 + but i cant unlock those labs?
