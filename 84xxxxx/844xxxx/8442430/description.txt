This was released as part of Criterion's Basil Dearden's London Underground set. League of Gentlemen and Victim are on TPB, here is the 3rd of the 4.

The film examines racial attitudes in 1950s London within the framework of a classic murder mystery and detective story. A lot of hypocrisy is buried under the veneer of civilized society...

I copped this from youtube, I thought I'd put it here in case they take it down. It's in flv format, I put it in a folder because TPB classes flv movies as video clips. It plays nicely on VLC, convert it to another format if you wish to burn it.
