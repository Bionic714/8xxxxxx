Come As You Are is the second solo album by Peter Wolf, released in 1987 (see 1987 in music). "Come As You Are" was a major hit for Wolf, peaking at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week.

The music video for "Come As You Are" is based on Bobby Van's memorable "street dance" from "Small Town Girl (1953)." In the video, Peter Wolf hops around a 1950s small town similar to the one in the movie, and he passes a poster for Small Town Girl as a direct reference to the inspiration for the video.
