From the Infowars web site :: On the Sunday, May 5 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the outrageous Israeli strike on Syria, and the total Twilight Zone-like bizarreness of Syria being unable to retaliate or defend itself due to the dilemma that any form of reprisal would likely give a green light for a full scale military assault by the US and Israel. 

Alex also breaks down how the West is committing war crimes by funding and arming the Al-Qaeda-led Syrian rebels, and examines the "It can't happen here" mentality comforting na√Øve Americans. 

On today's show, Alex will also analyze the persecution of Christians in the military and recently at a high school in Texas, and get into how the Boston bombing suspects being denied legal counsel is complete defiance of the Sixth Amendment of the Bill of Rights.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
