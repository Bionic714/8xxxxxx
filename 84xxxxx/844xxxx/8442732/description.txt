Encore press release of the Deep Purple cardboard sleeve reissue series featuring the high-fidelity SHM-CD format, digital remastering, and cardboard sleeve replicas of the original UK LP artwork including the original Warner Brothers Label. Limited pressing 2008.

Deep Purple survived a seemingly endless series of lineup changes and a dramatic mid-career shift from grandiose progressive rock to ear-shattering heavy metal to emerge as a true institution of the British hard rock community; once credited in the Guinness Book of World Records as the globe's loudest band, their revolving-door roster launched the careers of performers including Ritchie Blackmore, David Coverdale (the White Snake guy, lol), and Ian Gillan.

This isn't meant to be a complete discography, but a good overview of their early albums, and in my opinion, by far their best work before all the line up changes. This is essential music.
