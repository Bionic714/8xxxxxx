,oblivious2000,2013-05-06T04:56Z,"And ""The Winner"" from season 4?"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-06T11:17Z,"Yes, I have ""Trauma"" -- it's a Fall Guy crossover with a failed medical drama co-starring Lou Ferrigno. Terrible episode.  Will do that sometime this week as planned.  

Don't have several from this year or any from the 4th Season though."
