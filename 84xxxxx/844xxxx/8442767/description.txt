Dexter Gordon - Bopland: The Legendary Elk's Club Concert L.A. 1947

This 3 CD set is not really a Dexter Gordon album.

It is a concert which features Dexter Gordon along with Howard McGhee, Trummy Young, Sonny Criss, Wardell Gray, Hampton Hawes, Barney Kessel, Harry Babasin, Roy Porter, "Wild" Bill Moore, Gene Montgomery, Russ Freeman, Shifty Henry, Leroy Gray, Al Killian, Red Callender, Tim Kennedy, and Earl Coleman in various rotating lineups.

I have provided scans of the booklet.
