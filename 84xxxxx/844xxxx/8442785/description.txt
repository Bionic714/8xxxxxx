source >>>>>>DVD-R playON thanks

sample provided....i watch it first as there plenty of releases.

Note: Ok not too much BS here but problem with the subs on this|> yes i eventually did get English subtitle, after serious issues eg header problem :lol: checked sub and noticed it not complete and time delay of approx 1 sec ..hence i binned it and didnt upload it .....couldnt be bothered fixing it tbh....wasted enough time on it!.

This shouldnt have happened as timeline eg audio is fine on the film throughout! Weird?!.

Other than that thanks for source yes has a few issues in clarity so had to adjust a few things to try and make it look half decent......end of waffle!!.
