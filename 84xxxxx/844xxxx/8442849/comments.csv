,Divanus,2013-05-06T05:41Z,@darkizzle Chinga tu madre wey! If you don't know what that means is Fuck you! Please seed like there's no tomorrow!
,azoharthi,2013-05-06T05:43Z,"@darkizzle
WTF man, I was waiting for Tywin to die the whole episode, as a result of that I messed most of what happens."
,Violentos,2013-05-06T05:48Z,Don't worry you n00bs! darkizzle is full of shit. I read all the books. He's trolling. Successfully trolling I might add.
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-05-06T06:32Z,"I'm not sure how you guys can download the low quality version of this and spoil all the hard work the film makers put into the show.  Low quality and Game of Thrones do not mix.  Get the 1 GB version. It is worth it. And when all the seasons are complete, support the makers and buy the complete Bluray box set ! It will look damn nice on your DVD shelf. "
,fefero,2013-05-06T07:54Z,@darkizzle Dude why ruin the show for everyone! you should not tell them about the shadow and Tywin... or Sansa and Tyrion's plot... or the whole Bruce Wayne is Batman... is just not fair for you to spoil stuff as critical as that!
,gameofgroans,2013-05-06T08:07Z,"Awesome! Thanks eztv, another quality torrent as always.

I can't wait till Jon Snow pulls a double-cross and betrays the Wildlings, killing Ygritte in the process. What a bastard. (see what I did there? haha!)

Robb's gonna die at the Twins, while Sandor introduces his axe to the back of Arya's head!!! DAMMNNN she's my favorite character by far oh shit spoilers"
,VyperMk1,2013-05-06T08:08Z,"Darkizzle successfully trolling? ... Really it doesn't take much to be successful if that's the case.

I personally think Darkizzle is an idiot... He posts pointless rhetoric and probably doesn't even seed once he's finished downloading."
,YaredTheFireMage,2013-05-06T08:21Z,"Yet again, many thanks"
