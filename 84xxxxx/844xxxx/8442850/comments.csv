,834ch4,2013-05-12T05:02Z,@bigmick2 try redownloading torrent it should not be empty. Let me know if you're still having problems.
,834ch4,2013-05-12T05:14Z,"@bigmick2 
I noticed you made a similar comment on UMe2's torrent as well.  as he stated, and I did also, that our torrents contain other torrents.  You need to use your torrent client (utorrent or bittorrent or whatever you're using) to add a new torrent and open the files that this torrent contains (i.e. *in torrent client* click add new torrent > browse to 'season 1 doctor 1.torrent' and click open > finish other options to start torrent) You should be fine if you follow these easy steps.  
If after downloading this torrent and it does not contain 26 other torrent files then let me know."
,LazySummers,2013-05-13T18:01Z,"So I'm downloading the torrents you get from this torrent and there is 1 seeder, so if that person is reading this, thank you...also, don't turn off your computer lol"
,834ch4,2013-05-13T18:22Z,"@LazySummers
that would be me, for now, and I'll seed indefinitely.  Although occasionally I do have to stop the torrents, but don't worry, it will only be for a little while.  (i.e. tuesdays and thursdays there is a good chance I have to stop them for most of the day due to having school)"
,F6A12,2013-05-15T17:21Z,"Thanks, is great, sadly the download of the first season has slowed down since it reached 78.5%"
,mssrtibbs,2013-05-16T07:27Z,"Thank you!  I was trying to download the almost-300 Gb file, but it was saying 24 weeks, and that's just not feasible.  Glad to have found this, and blessings on the 72 seeders!"
,834ch4,2013-05-19T00:18Z,"Thank you all for DLing my torrent, please don't forget to seed all the seasons too, or at least seed the same amount of data that you leeched.  DOCTOR WHO IS COOL!!!"
,l3x0rcist3,2013-05-19T13:06Z,"You are officially my god.
Downloading season 1 at 2.2mb/s. I really hope it stays alive for long because it's going to take me a while to download. and i'll need to buy a new hard drive just for this. definitely seeding forever."
,834ch4,2013-05-19T14:06Z,"Don't forget to thank UMe2, the one who scoured the internet compiling this collection!!!"
,l3x0rcist3,2013-05-22T20:47Z,"Unfortunately, everyone get stuck at some % of the download in almost every season (except season 1)."
,Xoanon24,2013-05-22T21:25Z,"I am having the same problems.  All seasons but season one all stop at about 81-85% and have 300-700 peers but only 1, at the most 3 seeds.   If I'm missing something, let me know otherwise let's keep all 834ch4 & UMe2's hard work going!"
,l3x0rcist3,2013-05-23T00:29Z,"We all have the same problem. Everyone is at 80% on every seasons so there's no one or too few to seed the remaining 20% :/
I really hope it works out because this is the torrent of a lifetime."
,834ch4,2013-05-24T06:39Z,"@everyone
not sure why you guys are having problems with only the last 20%.  I am constantly seeding all seasons at least 1Mbps.  remember that tuesdays and thursdays I will most likely not be seeding so do not be alarmed, I will continue seeding that same night.
If you all are still having trouble over this weekend let me know, but even then I'm not sure what I could do..."
,l3x0rcist3,2013-05-25T13:10Z,"Of course it's not your fault it's just that you're the only one with the remaining % that none of the 700 people downloading have. that's why we all download at 1kb/s while you upload at 1mb/s.
You're still my hero, and thank you for what you're doing :)"
,834ch4,2013-05-25T14:57Z,"@ l3x0rcist3
thank you for your support.

@ everyone, just wanted to let you know that in addition to the possible pauses during the week, on 5/31 it will be stop and go for a portion of the day so do not worry :)"
,F0rt3,2013-05-26T14:42Z,"Just wanted to say thanks to 834ch4 for your hard work! I was also trying to download the 300GB torrent and with my connection at home it just wasn't worth the wait. With this way it's definitely a lot more doable. Currently seeding Season 1, and unfortunately am experiencing the being stuck at 80%, but I'm sure that will resolve itself. Will definitely seed!!"
,trux1,2013-06-01T16:27Z,Barely any seeders for multiple seasons.  wtf
,HappilyMoshing,2013-06-03T14:48Z,Hi. Thanks heaps for this. My kids are big fans of all the new Doctor Who's and have never had the pleasure of seeing where it all began (neither had I just quitely-Not so far back anyways) Each one is taking me quite awhile to download but it's still totally awesome once we get too watch it. Thanks again :-)
,govegan22,2013-06-04T01:35Z,"doing my best to seed, everyone else please do the same"
,834ch4,2013-06-04T05:08Z,"Thank you all for seeding it really helps seeing as these are large files and I am seeding ALL of them at once.  I know it would be faster for everyone to get each season one after the other if I seeded each for a period of time but how am I to know when to switch.  It seems that I would be cutting some off regardless, therefore, I'll just have to seed them all ALWAYS.  

btw, I will no longer have to stop seeding tuesdays and thursdays because I've finished school!!  now i only have to stop on short rare intervals.  So get it while it's HOT!"
,eponine,2013-06-04T13:24Z,"I'm seeding everything as much as I can, and will keep doing that for a while. And I seriously hope someone else will as well, because I've almost finished watching the first season, and I haven't got the second down yet... and right now it's not moving forward at all. :("
,FBrigdon,2013-06-07T22:20Z,"Could someone please help seed these? I am only on Season 3 and it is going nowhere at all....
THank you in advance!"
,_lucky_,2013-06-08T11:30Z,"2 thumbs up for this project.
However, it seems that it has reached a bottleneck.
The movies and Season1+2 have a good number of seeds after the first months. It goes downhill from there.
Why? Because those with the full set are also sharing parts everybody else has making the other parts even more rare.
You should consider sharing the files periodically for now.
- Pause the movies and Season 1+2
- Powershare Season 3+4
- Wait for them to have ~50 Seeds
- Switch to Season 5+6#
- Continue to the end and start them all back up again.

As it is right now, ppl with the rare parts are ""wasting"" connections and bandwidth on files everybody else has anyway and we will never get it done. It would essentially be the same as downloading the 200Gig file in the first place..."
,834ch4,2013-06-09T05:16Z,"@_lucky_

thank you for that suggestion, I was only wondering how to go about it.  So just as _lucky_ said, that is what i shall do."
,FBrigdon,2013-06-09T17:14Z,"Thanks for the new seeds, folks! I am seeding the first four seasons and am up to dling 5 and 6 now... I will help out as much as possible."
