This torrent was created so that each season of the original dr who can be a separate torrent for faster downloading.  Instead of dling a torrent of 280 gigs you get 28 separate 10gig torrents.  

This torrent includes torrent files:
a torrent file for each season 1~26
a torrent file for the movie
and a torrent file for the extra movies in 1965-1966 (that most people ignore because the the doctor is Peter Cushing, but they only have a vague similarity to the TV series)  

I give full credit and many kudos to UMe2, who originally uploaded this collection.  But due to popular demand and because the torrent that UMe2 280+gigs, i have uploaded that same collection in smaller segments.

Note: this is my first ever upload to a torrent site, please let me know if you have any suggestions.  I will have this, and all torrents included, seeding for as long as possible due to my love of all that is Doctor Who.  But we all know that laptops are portable for a reason and the tower containing this collection may not always be attached, so don't lose hope if it takes a while (took me 2 weeks straight) to get them all.  So please seed after download.  Thank you.
