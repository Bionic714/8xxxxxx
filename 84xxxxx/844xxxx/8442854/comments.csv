,topk,2013-05-06T04:34Z,"I'll wait for a proper
1.06GB seems slightly undersized"
,topk,2013-05-06T04:35Z,"GIBE BIGGEST FILE SIZE/BEST QUALITY!

I'll wait for a proper. This one was posted minutes after it finished airing on TV"
,topk,2013-05-06T04:37Z,"I wish BOZX was releasing HD TV Shows
BOXZ = best quality 

Fuck file size, this is 2013 and 4K Ultra HD is just round the corner.

People need to start protesting en masse against the download caps."
,topk,2013-05-06T04:39Z,1.06 GB is telling me that this is half-baked turd of release
,jesman0,2013-05-06T05:07Z,Seed! An hour with only 2 connections. RAWR!
,Primuz017,2013-05-06T05:19Z,"Jesus christ, such a worthless episode, it's pure shit, what's up with this.......fuck.. 1 more week then.."

,rockulikahuricocaine,2013-05-06T05:56Z,"It's only 1 hour and 720p, so the size of 1.06 GiB is perfect for me since I like to watch it ASAP after it airs.  It was one of the first torrents available after the show aired and the quality is more than acceptable considering how fast it was available.

The whiners in here should just subscribe to HBO or STFU.

Thank you DibyaTPB, your effort is very much appreciated here.  Don't listen to these ingrate losers."
,omgzelda,2013-05-06T06:03Z,"1gb is the correct size idiots, it depends on what the context of the episode is now the size"
,XeRocks81,2013-05-06T06:17Z,"all the ep 6 720p torrents are duds as fas as I can tell right,  has anybody managed to download one?"
,Primuz017,2013-05-06T06:18Z,"No a single scene with khaleesi the entire episode lol, they're just climbing that wall and when they get to the top it ends xD ops spoiler alert xd^^"
,rockulikahuricocaine,2013-05-06T06:26Z,"Danimal1q2w3, can't you just adjust the audio sync with VLC if it's a little off for you?"
,PENGUIN1234,2013-05-06T06:28Z,"There is literally nothing wrong with the audio or the video, and it's the entire episode. It's definitely in 720p, so if you want to watch it, then download it. Don't listen to these people complaining about nothing. Took me about 20 min to download. "
,rockulikahuricocaine,2013-05-06T06:30Z,"Danimal1q2w3, I'm watching it now, not out of sync for me with VLC on Mac.

v-9
a-9

I'm seeding this one, it's good quality by my standards.  Thanks again, DibyaTPB."
,downlode,2013-05-06T06:31Z,Thank You
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-05-06T06:37Z,"@Primuz017

If all the season are based off each book release. You will be saying that about the entire season 4.  A Song of Ice and Fire book 4 is  very boring.  But I trust that the producers will include books 4 and 5 into one season. "
,gameofgroans,2013-05-06T08:12Z,"Awesome! Thanks eztv, another quality torrent as always.

I can't wait till Jon Snow pulls a double-cross and betrays the Wildlings, killing Ygritte in the process. What a bastard. (see what I did there? haha!)

Robb's gonna die at the Twins, while Sandor introduces his axe to the back of Arya's head!!! DAMMNNN she's my favorite character by far oh shit spoilers"
,ryballs,2013-05-06T10:16Z,I don't think Arya is actually dead.. There's a lot of dream sequences and I think that may be one of them. I hope so anyway :)
,kiwij,2013-05-06T10:20Z,"Just a comment, quality is fine and is consistent/close to previous releases.  No errors, and no real reason not to download this rip."
,kiwij,2013-05-06T10:22Z,"A:10 V:10 - No Lag, perfect rip.  File size smaller, due to this episode having more static scenes with low contrast that compress more easily."
,status00001,2013-05-06T13:10Z,"Thx for sharing!

and fucking Spoilers, thus i never read the whole comments, only the numbers :P"
,funkydopeloven,2013-05-06T18:54Z,another bad release. stop racing and do some quality control.
,funkydopeloven,2013-05-06T19:30Z,i retract my remarks. i'm done with vlc
