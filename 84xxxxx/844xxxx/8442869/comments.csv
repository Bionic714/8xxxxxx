,tflagger997,2013-05-06T23:52Z,"Anyone complaining about S3 better get some NFL gear as the 4th book was total filler.  I am half-way through the fifth one and while there is some progress, it is *very* slow and has quite a bit of filler too.  

I looks like Mr.Martin does not have any capable editors that can explain that spending 100+ pages on a character of no importance that is nothing more than a footnote in the overall story, is not a good use of space or reader's time.  

It is expected that HBO did not hire people capable of actually re-writing the series and condensing it into something suitable for TV.  So when the book is good the show is good.  So enjoy what you have now, since Season 3 is the best you are going to get until at least mid-Season 5.  Winter is here, though no one really seems to care..."
