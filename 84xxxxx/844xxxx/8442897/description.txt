sorry guys for taking so long to upload this, I've been a little busy

Reflector 1.2.3 for Windows

Cracked and working again :)

Install
after installation copy crackeado1 and crackeado2 to app dir, open crackeado1 put anything you want for serial and hit ok, it should show "Thank you for purchasing Reflector" :P then close it from the little icon in the task bar....

after doing all that open crackeado2 it shouldn't show anything like a window when opened, just the icon in the task bar, from that icon you can configure program options...

if all that happens, then you can delete original reflection.exe and crackeado1.exe, and rename crackeado2.exe to reflection.exe
