From last.fm: 

"Based somewhere in the hazy land mass that is North America, Divtech is set to drive a burning hot steak through the heart of the online breakcore networks. Rarely are we privy to such a tinnitus inducing onslaught of cybergrind percussion rushes and chiptune barbarism. Expect Gabber, Heavy Metal, Grindcore and 8-bit blended together with all the fine attention to detail that has come to be expected from the incredibly diverse North American breakcore scene."
