,tdurden83,2013-05-06T20:08Z,thx for the ul. still can't believe they got rid of young justice tho
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-06T20:42Z,i don't get it either really. you're welcome.
,tantonj,2013-05-07T01:18Z,ikr? like teen titans is 0.5% of what young justice was. I just hope beware the batman can make up for both series gone (gl and yj).  But I understand the move to teen titans go! it reaches the market more. after all they(production) don't make these for people like us who just download them off the most wonderful construct of man.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T01:53Z,"yeah and i also think they might hope to someday make TT into a movie, whereas there might not be as good of a chance to make YJ into one due to TT having less ""legacy"" heroes? it's a theory anyway..."
