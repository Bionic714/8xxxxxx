,eletech,2013-05-06T07:44Z,"Jesus christ, think you should post that on every torrent for this episode. I am sure people so value your opinion. Cry stomp the floor a little bang your head if you like GET A GOD DAMN GRIP. Stupid people make me laugh sometimes."
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2013-05-06T07:46Z,thnx EZ!
,gameofgroans,2013-05-06T08:09Z,"Awesome! Thanks eztv, another quality torrent as always.

I can't wait till Jon Snow pulls a double-cross and betrays the Wildlings, killing Ygritte in the process. What a bastard. (see what I did there? haha!)

Robb's gonna die at the Twins, while Sandor introduces his axe to the back of Arya's head!!! DAMMNNN she's my favorite character by far oh shit spoilers"

,TaylorBA,2013-05-06T16:51Z,Don't know if it was mu imagination but the audio seemed slightly out of sync for the first 10 minutes.
,StayPlation,2013-05-06T16:58Z,"To moderators: Please remove any plot information posted by trolls, even if it turns out to be wrong. It ruins it for a lot of people.

Comments should be used for quality feedback, not much else. Thanks."
,OnAStick,2013-05-06T17:39Z,"@StayPlation

I agree with you that it sucks when people post spoilers, but I kind of laughed at the thought that there are actually ""moderators"" looking at the comments. Pretty wishful thinking!

That said, it seems like about 90% of the time the ""spoilers"" that are posted aren't actually spoilers at all. More times than not, assholes post false plot points just to get a rise out of people. Obviously, that isn't always the case, but most of the time (at least in my experience)."

Update: Orlydb removed the nuke status. 
This release meets The Scene standards.
Under 120ms oos is allowed... and is barely noticeable.
