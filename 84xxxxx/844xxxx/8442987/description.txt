Most famous as a writer and countercultural theorist, Timothy Leary recorded a collectable spoken word/sound montage album of sorts at the height of the psychedelic era, and released cassettes of his lectures on his own.

"The musical equivalent of a full-blown LSD trip," according to the liner notes. If that's what you're looking for, you should opt for something a lot more clich√©d and conventional, like Sgt. Pepper's, Piper at the Gates of Dawn, or Electric Ladyland. Long a scarce collector's item, this features three extended "raps" by Dr. Leary over collage-like backing tracks of music (including brief samples of the Beatles and Pink Floyd), percussion, and electronics. The raps, which were guaranteed to make parents recoil in horror at the time, sound quaintly dated and silly today, rife with self-conscious mantras and revelatory declarations of breakthroughs into different planes of consciousness and celebrations of the wonders of drug use. This timepiece owes much of its collectibility to "Live and Let Live," which features an unspectacular jam in the background by an all-star band of Jimi Hendrix (on bass), Stephen Stills, John Sebastian, and Buddy Miles.
