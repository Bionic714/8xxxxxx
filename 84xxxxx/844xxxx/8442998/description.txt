FULLY PATCHED.




**No freezing on any puzzle **


I played through the game two times on different "patched" versions... with the game freezing on one of the last doors. 


I patched it myself and it works through every door, puzzle and ending. 100%


This goes without saying, but you need a flashcart to play downloaded games like this on the DSTWO or R4 card. If you don't know how to put games onto one of these devices, use google.



This torrent is years too late, and so it's likely going to be hard to find for latecomers to the game. Please seed.


This is my first upload, and so I hope you enjoy.
