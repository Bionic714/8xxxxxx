,RenegadeDeer,2013-05-06T11:03Z,"Meaning the glitches that would make the game freeze with the first puzzle (in Junpei's cabin) and door 2,6,1 have been removed. "
,dt7ll5op,2013-05-06T16:38Z,"wow, they published a game which freeze on the first event?"
,RenegadeDeer,2013-05-06T19:39Z,"My friends with the actual cartridge report no problems. It's just a nasty issue with the .nds files you find online.

I'm grateful to simmyboy80 for uploading the file years ago, but for many gamers (myself included) that copy of the game consistently froze on certain puzzles.

Hell, all of them had similar issues. The only alternative then is to download a complete save file and work your away around the glitches... which sucks. So, it needed to be fixed.

So, I hope this version at least reaches a few latecomers to the game and saves you guys from hours of misery, haha. Have a fun time."
