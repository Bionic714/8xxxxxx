Introducing my first upload:
Batman: Death of the Family complete storyline


---------------------------

After a year of isolation, The Joker has returned to plague Gotham, Batman, and his extended crime-fighting family in the next major story after Night of The Owls. Named Death of The Family, the first issue arrived October 10, 2012, and crossed over into many other DC, Batman-Related titles. Death of The Family comes from Scott Synder and Greg Capullo

It's been one year since we've seen him. He's been completely untraceable and the only thing we remembered was that Batman's greatest nemesis was last seen in Arkham Asylum, and in the process of having the flesh from his face removed. Now The Joker has returned...and he's not the same. There's a whispering of secrets revealed and even Batman has to reevaluate his long-time enemy in this epic story.
