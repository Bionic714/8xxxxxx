Okay, some of you may be confused, I was too because there seems to conflicting online guides.

Bottom line is this IS Episode 4.  What some sites say is Episode 4 ""American Killers"" is incorrect. Last week's ep of RM was a cut-down shortened version of the 2-hr long Season 4 premiere titled American Killers.

In time the online guides will correct themselves.
And please do not bring up Animal Planet's website. I was there. If you read the summary for Season 5 Episode 4 ""American Killers"" it is the exact same summary they have for Season 5 Episode 3 ""Killer Torpedo"".  Yeah, AP's own website is wrong. There really is no Season 5 Episode 4 ""American Killers"", m'kay? Just want to get that clear before anyone starts questioning and/or complaining."
