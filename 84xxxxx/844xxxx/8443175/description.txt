Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the seventh studio album by the British singer-songwriter Elton John. Released in 1973, it has come to be regarded as one of his best and most popular albums.

In 2003, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[1] The album was ranked No. 91 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time,[2] and No. 59 in Channel 4's 2009 list of 100 Greatest Albums.[3] The album has sold 31 million copies.[4]

Initially regarded as having some good tracks, but being too diverse, not holding together, and being too long and patchy,[15][16][17] Goodbye Yellow Brick Road has come to be regarded as John's best and most popular album,[5] and is his best selling studio album.[citation needed] Three singles were released in the US: "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", "Bennie and the Jets" and "Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting".

It was certified gold in October 1973, 5× platinum in March 1993, 6× platinum in September 1995 and 7× platinum in August 1998 by the RIAA.
