,resmania,2013-05-07T08:40Z,works great with crack included in 1.07 torrent.
,tornade25,2013-05-07T12:32Z,"Thank you, works perfectly well.

It is the only jet I love to fly, it is almost as simple as a piston engine plane."
,yuca,2013-05-07T20:49Z,"Thanks for this. Downloaded, installed and cracked with version .07. Can't get the PFD or the MFD to switch on. No avionics. Any help? Maybe it is not cracked correctly?"
,yuca,2013-05-08T01:22Z,"Figure it out. Just needed to drop one of the dll's inside the gauges folder and the other inside the mustang g1000 gauges folder. 
Thanks!"
,Redneck12,2013-05-12T22:35Z,"Yea Its a great plane, And I felt $50 is way to much to be able to fly. Im glad you guys like the torrent!"
