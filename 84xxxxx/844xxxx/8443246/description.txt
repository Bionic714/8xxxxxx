This is an older scan by Sc-Scans that I've repacked into a couple seperate volumes, spliced some pages together, and renamed so it all reads happy on my tablet. I did remove the credits pages as well, so sorry to the guys that made it all possible. Thanks, also. I'm putting this up because, strangely- it's just not already here.

Naota is a lonely boy in a lonely town living a quiet life amidst utter chaos. His father's a perv and his grandfather a nut. His brother left to seek riches playing baseball in America, and now the brother's ex-girlfriend won't leave Naota alone. Then, from beyond the stars drops an impish defender sent forth to stop alien robots from destroying the Earth. Where do the alien robots come from? Well, from Naota's forehead for starters. From the twisted mind that brought us End of Evangelion comes this bizarre tale of adolescence in a futuristic, fantastical world.
