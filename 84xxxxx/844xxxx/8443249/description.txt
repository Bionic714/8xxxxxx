This is an older scan by Sc-Scans that I've repacked into a couple seperate volumes, spliced some pages together, and renamed so it all reads happy on my tablet. I did remove the credits pages as well, so sorry to the guys that made it all possible. Thanks, also. I'm putting this up because, strangely- it's just not already here.

Naoto goes from high school nothing to mutant warrior in the blink of any eye. But what does it all mean? The town stirs with gossip when the Mayor's adulterous affair makes headlines. And his daughter, Ninamori, the class president and Naoto's friend, is having a hard time of it. So hard, in fact, that she turns into a giant balloon to challenge Naoto in battle. And Haruko is closing in on the interplanetary foes she was dispatched to dispatch. And is there any saving Mamimi from her downwardly spiraling descent into madness? Plunge deeper into the dreamscape with FLCL Volume 2.
