Shannon Kane was the wife of Harry Kane, a chemist who worked for the government. But Harry was killed by "enemies of his country." In searching through his records Shannon discovered the formula for a "spider-web fluid," which "sticks like glue--and it's actually strong enough to swing on!" Shannon invented a set of bracelets to shoot out the fluid, and became the sworn enemy of all criminals--Spider Queen. She found a potential love interest in detective Mike O'Bell, who was as interested in the young widow as he was in the costumed heroine.
