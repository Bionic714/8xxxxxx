With the release of their latest CD, ┬íAmericano!, Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers have crossed their Rubicon. 

┬íAmericano! is an amazing blend of the gut level, rock-n-roll intensity front man Roger Clyne displayed while leading MercuryΓÇÖs Refreshments, and the deep, philosophical muse he consulted when he wrote The PeacemakersΓÇÖ third album, Sonoran Hope and Madness. The albumΓÇÖs themes are extensive. Touching on love and life, war and death, rogues and revolution, its songs whisk you into a whirling world of chaos, where loving is worth the risk, living is worth the price of dying, and water and blood flow freely. I don't think this masterpiece will be leaving my CD changer for months to come, and I know I wonΓÇÖt be pressing the skip button when I listen to this one. Ever.
