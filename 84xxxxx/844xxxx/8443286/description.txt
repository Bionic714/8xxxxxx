Portable version of COMODO Unite 3.0.2.0.

It comes with 3 executables:
  # COMODO Unite (run).exe: Makes all changes needed to run COMODO Unite, then run it.
  # COMODO Unite (clean).exe: Reverts all changes made on the computer by the first executable.
  # COMODO Unite (run & clean).exe: Makes all changes needed to run COMODO Unite, then run it and clean everything up when COMODO Unite is closed.

The last executable is the most portable of the three, but the first one is faster on subsequent runs.

All of the three executables need administrator permissions to run.

IMPORTANT: It is possible that COMODO Unite 3.0.2.0 Portable WILL CRASH if COMODO Unite is already installed on the machine.
