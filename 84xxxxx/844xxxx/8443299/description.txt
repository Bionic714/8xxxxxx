Description:

This assembly is the successor of the assembly Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 RUS-ENG x86-x64-18in1-Activated (AIO). 
It is distinguished from its predecessor is that the current assembly includes updates as of April 17, 
2013, plus some extra chips. Release of this assembly, meanwhile, does not mean that its predecessor lost relevance. 
For those who prefer to work with assemblies as close as possible to the original distribution, it is still relevant! 
In developing the same assembly that is presented here, I walked away a little from its principles include the 
reluctance of the foreign application. On this below ...

So, this assembly includes 9 Russian editions and 9 English editions of Windows 7 SP1 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) kernel:

The efficiency of the assembly as far as possible thoroughly verified.
After installation, you get a fully registered and activated version of Windows 7 chosen modifications.

Due to the fact that during the assembly operation revealed a number of shortcomings associated with 
incorrect operation USB3 drivers from Intel and installing the system under UEFI, assembly of 27 April 2013 
was to rebuild the to eliminate these problems. This so-called "silent update" without changing the version 
of the assembly. Those who have already downloaded the release, I offer my sincere apology. But I want to 
note that if the above shortcomings for you are not critical, then release to swing again for you does not make sense. 
Use the original version!

Some features of the assembly

- The assembly integrates all critical updates available as of April 17, 2013, including Internet Explorer 10.
- Instead of embedded by default along with the updates Microsoft. NET Firework 4 Client Profile in the assembly 
of integrated light option. NET Framework 4.5 (draft [Slim]. NET Framework 4.5 Full x86/x64).
- The assembly integrated into Microsoft Visual C + + 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2012 Redistributable Package latest versions. 
To avoid duplicating install different applications earlier versions and redirect programs that require these packages 
to newer versions of libraries, installing older versions locked plugs 
(project [addon] Microsoft Visual C + + 2005-2008-2010-2012 Redistributable Package Hybrid).

- In the assembly of integrated drivers for USB3 following manufacturers and versions: AMD version 1.0.0.0072, 
Asmedia version 1.16.4.0, Etron version 1.00.0000.0115, Fresco Logic version 3.5.97.0, Intel and Renesas 
version 1.0.8.251 version 2.1.39.0. Integration performed in installer and installed in the OS.
- At a very early stage of the installation is pre-load a menu where you can select the bit of the primary shell, 
that is what the loader will be used to install, x86 or x64. Because of this, 
you should not worry that the 64-bit version of the OS can not stand up for RAID, and that users of 64-bit operating systems 
may be without service recovery system. For the most inquisitive: Do not attempt to install the 32-bit version of the OS 
from the 64-bit boot - the final stage of the installation boot loader will throw an error and refuses to continue the 
installation.

- In the System Restore service is triggered from the installation disk, and built into the system, the module is integrated 
Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (MSDaRT) version 7.0, which greatly expands the possibilities of resuscitation system.
- If during installation you have entered valid license key in the appropriate field, then the system will be activated by this 
switch to an entirely legitimate. If the field is left blank, will be used for alternative methods of activation.
- If you are installing on a computer that has a BIOS'e SLIC-table version 2.1 and above, will involve the standard legal (almost) 
the means of activation, developed by Microsoft for these computers.

- If you do not have a license key and there is no SLIC-table BIOS'e, the system will activate a built-in assembly activator.
- If you choose to install Windows 7 Ultimate (maximum), then after installation you will be able to switch the interface language 
from English to Russian and back standard means Windows 7 Ultimate (maximum). If you have installed any other version that you 
can use for this purpose utility Vistalizator, a label which is available in the "Start" menu.
- For technical reasons, the 64-bit version of Windows 7 with this assembly can not be updated for 64-bit version of Windows Vista / 7. 
However, there is an opportunity to initiate a so-called Custom installation. When you run the installation from 
DVD / USB-device as a bootable media, it's simple. But to initiate the installation from an already running a 64-bit OS, 
it is not necessary to start a setup.exe in the root directory with the distribution, and through setup.exe, 
which is located in the Sources folder distribution.
