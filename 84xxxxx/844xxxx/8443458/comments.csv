,geenotreally,2013-05-06T11:37Z,Thank for the quick upload dibya. Could you verify if this is different from the other HDTV capture (which looked like it was recorded off a plasma screen with a camcorder)? Thank you either way.

can't help noticing that the end of the program has been cut off. Good 5ch audio, had to re encode & raise the volume of it approx 11db, somehow it was suppressed."
