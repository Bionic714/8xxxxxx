Noah and the Whale's fourth studio album, Heart of Nowhere, is the follow-up to platinum-selling Last Night on Earth. The album features the exuberant single "There Will Come a Time" alongside nine other new songs, including the Anna Calvi-featuring title track. From epic single There Will Come A Time to the nostalgically blissful ΓÇÿLifetimeΓÇÖ, this band has succeeded at writing an exceptional album thatΓÇÖs both intimate and full of pop-hook goodness, all without using over-the-top production techniques.
