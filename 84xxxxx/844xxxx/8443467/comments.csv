,DakotaSmith,2013-05-07T16:47Z,"The Defense Distributed ""Liberator"" .380 single shot pistol is a fully 3D-printable firearm.

In abject violation of the Second Amendment, American lawmakers have for decades willfully, intentionally, and traitorously violated their Oaths of Office.  In particular, they have destroyed the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which reads:

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

The Militia is not the National Guard.  As is clear from any knowledge of history, the Militia is any able-bodied citizen.

The intent of the Second Amendment is not to protect hunting nor self-defense.  It is to empower the governed to overthrow the government should it become tyrannical.

There is no question as to this intent, and any argument to the contrary betrays only a shocking ignorance on the part of the person making the argument.

Over the course of the 20th Century, successive generations of would-be tyrants masquerading as Congressmen, Senators, Presidents, and Judges have sought to pull the teeth of the Second Amendment.  Today, in abject violation of it, the United States has over 20,000 victim disarmament laws.

We can no longer defend ourselves:  neither from tyrants in government, nor terrorists, nor street thugs.

This is about to change.

The Liberator is the first 3D-printable gun.  You may freely download these plans and print your own.  You will have available to you a gun capable of firing a .380 caliber bullet.

And no one -- not your next door neighbor, nor your mayor, nor your Congressman -- will know that you have it.

This is the first in what will become an avalanche of undetectable, untraceable, easy-to-manufacture weapons that will turn the tables on evil-doers the world over.

Share and enjoy."

Well, it's clear from any knowledge of the US constitution (try reading it) that the militia is an institute to be raised by congress, aka the National Guard. 

It's also worth mentioning that the constitution *explicitly* defines fighting against the government as treason, which is punishable by death.

,agenthex,2013-05-10T08:38Z,"> Bullshit.

Again, if you're going to use the constitution as a justification for the argument, it's very much in your interest to read the constitution:

Clause 15. The Congress shall have Power To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, *suppress Insurrections* and repel 
Invasions.

Note the *'ed phrase.

Clause 16. The Congress shall have Power To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.

The militia is not just the National Guard although that is part of it.

10 USC § 311 - Militia: composition and classes

The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.

(b) The classes of the militia are— 
(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and 
(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.

Source: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/311

As for Section 8 of the constitution, the operative phrases are ""provide for"" and ""governing"".

The former simply gives Congress the power to pay the States for all of the proceeding activities: organizing, arming, etc.

The latter refers to activating those militia units to do the bidding of the United States government."

First, much obliged if you can teach basic reading skills to your peers who have trouble using them on the doc in question.

If the framers of this country desired the constitution to be ""crystal clear"" instead of intentionally ambiguious (such that the doc may be better interpreted and serve the nation as time passes) I'd like to believe that they possessed the basic literacy to use more concrete wording instead of rather clever ambivalence. 

Unfortunately however the inhabitants of their country continue to be simple despite this passage of time and still consider the founding doc to be the work of fellow simpletons who thought of the world in black and white.

To writ, this is not mere supposition, since my first comment above abundantly demonstrates that the most ardent ""patriots"" can't even bother to read a few dozen pages before mouthing off on 'Murica.

Said like a like true american coach-dweller who's never stepped foot into the world outside. It's not really a surprise this sort of ""libertarianism"" only exists in the US.

Since it's a futile quest to penetrate this complimentary defense of willful ignorance and stupidity, I'll instead offer an explanation of the composition of the regressive half of the american population for our intl audience who aren't familiar with the arguments:

While they share commonality in childish fascination for brandishing guns and bible thumping, there's two distinct classes among them: the white trash and wannabe nouveau riche. It's arguable they're barely two steps removed, which is fair enough since economically they're only separated by a marginal social safety net. But then again, the white trash only differ in skin color from the welfare queens (ie poor non-whites) they're indoctrinated to despise. A succinct summary of american white trash can be found here: http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2008/10/31/9105/9154 . 

The pretend nouveau riche are however culturally distinct from this in that they've usually benefited more from socialist schools and gubmint edu loans to get some post-secondary degree and therefore envy themselves akin to the truly wealthy aristocracy (eg Bush II, whom they believe simple ""worked harder""), instead of the reality of one serious illness away from whitetrash-land. These were termed the suburban commandos since they prefer to live away from the city to avoid ""dangerous"" color folk, yet ironically mouth off about rebelling against the word's premier armed forces.

This is the sort of cultural cesspool that the american aristocracy draws from to consolidate money/power, since its simple minded natural and trained aversion to better educated ""ivory tower elitists"" makes them easy to manipulate and perform bidding of the ownership class. Once these rather basic american socioeconomics are observed, it's much easier to understand the rather exceptionally bizarre politics for what's supposed to be an advanced first world nation."
,agenthex,2013-05-14T04:22Z,">   In the event of open government tyranny, those illusions will all melt away and the corruption of the system will become apparent to even the most dumbed down members of the public. 

Btw, this is basically the apocalyptic fantasy of people (ie ""libertarians"") who have no meaningful future outside of wage slavery at the feet of petty authoritarian managers. But they're told to pay no attention to who they serve their entire lives 9-5, because it's easier to scapegoat the gubmint or (privately own) media or immigrants or aliens for their lack of any meaningful political power (ie $$).

Nevermind most of the 'Murica crowd have been historically been on the wrong side of slavery, women's rights, civil rights, and the list goes on.

It's really unfortunate for the country that these people are too dumb to rub a few brain cells together, but barely smart enough to breathe and chew food."
,LOLicopter,2013-05-14T20:15Z,"LOL.

So why again do you want to disarm the citizens when it's the government that's corrupt, in bed with the corporations, and behaving scandalously?  

That part is still not clear.  Why do you refuse to answer that question?  "
,AlexLibman,2013-05-14T23:25Z,"The Right to Self-Defense comes not from any government's Constitution, but from a rational inquiry into the question of how human beings ought to conduct themselves in order to sustain civilization, and to facilitate its further growth. And countless studies point to the same conclusion - the best deterrent against violence is balance of power.

The question isn't whether we can wave a magic wand and live in a world free from weapons. Guns will not be un-invented any time soon - in fact their manufacturing will become ever-cheaper and more decentralized, thanks to 3D printers and other 21st century tech. The real question is who will hold the power - a corrupt and unaccountable monopoly on violence called ''government'', the aggressive thugs who are already willing to violate all laws, or every self-owning individual (sane adult) who is willing to take on this responsibility?"
,AlexLibman,2013-05-14T23:26Z,"(Continued from my above comment.  I had trouble posting comments - there seems to be a weird random length limit or something...) 

And it is indeed a great responsibility, because, in absence of the ''divine right of government'', every person is accountable for his/her actions, and with more powerful weapons come ever-greater risk and insurance liabilities. In a free market, economic pressures would encourage the proliferation of defense-specific less-lethal weapons tech. And only a government, with nearly-unlimited capacity to steal and dodge liability, could ever build an aircraft carrier or a nuclear submarine!"

While I appreciate your enthusiasm in demonstrating the claim that this white trash class are borderline retarded, a retard screaming for answers to questions which have already been answered many times by multiple people above is still tiresome:

Small arms are ineffective against any sort of modern military (which is why insurgents overwhelmingly use explosive devices), yet have a noticeable effective in civil society. Many things which are dangerous without tangible benefits are restricted, such as toxic agents, hard drugs, etc for reasons obvious to all but the mentally retarded."

This is incredible first world naivety. Warlords usually dominate parts of the without civil society (ie some form of gubmint). It's basically like some child claiming that since jails hold criminals, we could get rid of criminals by not having any more jails. Cute from a 5 year old living in relative safety, but sad when spoken by a grown man. "

Is that why the U.S. military made it a point to round up as many small arms as possible, including sidearms, during their occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq?

LOL, maybe they should have consulted with you first.  

""Many things which are dangerous without tangible benefits are restricted, such as toxic agents, hard drugs, etc for reasons obvious to all but the mentally retarded.""

LOL, more obfuscation.  Nobody asked what sorts of items are restricted by government and the rationale given for doing so.

Again, why are you so interested the citizens living under a corrupt government that's obviously fascistic and in bed with multinational corporations?  

Let me guess, you'll answer with something like:

""But, but, but...  Uh, toxic chemicals and drugs and stuff!  Retarded! Uh, government knows best!""

Ha, ha, ha, what a schmuck!

No, it's not really like that at all.  Apples, oranges.

Therefore you obviously need a better education (better than the marginal one you already have)  I suggest a high school textbooks."
