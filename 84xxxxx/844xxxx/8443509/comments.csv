,SLICK65,2013-05-09T06:48Z,I'm eagerly waiting - I'll be watching for them all - Thanks again!
,SLICK65,2013-05-09T22:59Z,Hi - me again - just tried to watch Love Me Tender which I had burned to a DVD and the sound cut off at 30 min - I have burned over 1000 movies using Convert X to DVD and this has only happened with 3 or 4 other files so I'm assuming it's the file and not my end - cab I expect this to happen with the other 2 I'm DL ing now -? Any Ideas? 
,SLICK65,2013-05-09T23:01Z,Also  - no one seems to be seeding either 2 of the other movies - Help!
,SLICK65,2013-05-11T06:55Z,Well I burned Loving You  to DVD using Convert x and the picture jumps (quick and small starts and stops) - cant say how it is to watch on your own PC but definitely not suitable for burning - Sad cause I really was looking forward to these Elvis Movies - Will watch Jailhouse Rock tomorrow and let you know>
,SLICK65,2013-05-12T08:02Z,Burned Jailhouse Rock as well as the other 2 elvis movies - only found 2 spots where there was skipping (jumpy) and sound was ok - 3rd time a charm - hope that means that all the rest will be OK as well
