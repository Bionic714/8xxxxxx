Unless you count all updates from 8 months back, you'll have no idea what the hell ""Update 13"" even means. We go by game versions."
,whorw,2013-05-06T20:50Z,@dahaka47 the update means it's release #13 of boarderlands 2 from skidrow.  don't be stupid.  They have always numbered their updates because the game version might stay the same while they do a change to the crack.
,dahaka47,2013-05-06T22:25Z,"Oh, I'm not stupid. I also know that SKIDROW missed one or two updates and didn't crack them. So which version ""13"" means is anyone's guess."
,Vitez544,2013-05-09T18:40Z,"@dahaka47 While there is no version information, if you bother to read the torrent info and description you will find your self knowing its 1.5.0 version, but I guess some people bitch just to bitch and not bother to read.

Example .. first line of the torrent info.... and i quote ... 
""General

Added a new play through called Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, ...""
Knowing that .. its 1.5.0 version and no need for bitchy words, just tad of logic and 3 seconds patience to read."
,TheWalkingHell,2013-05-13T19:14Z,"i must disagree. i've already install this update and it's game version 1.4 and does not include any dlc. I was hopping this release could fix the Reloaded all dlc 1.5 version which it's only in english and doesn't allow you to change your name (you're always called RLD!, no matter what you use, like the name changer)"
,wrecktem,2013-06-01T01:30Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This will ruin your game. I had a perfectly fine running game before I tried this patch out. I had all DLC's, I just needed the new patch to earn XP in UVHM and so I downloaded and installed this patch and Borderlands 2 won't launch now."
