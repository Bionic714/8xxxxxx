This is Shingeki no Kyojin - The complete English Manga from chapters 1 through to chapter 43 (9 volumes I think it was off my head). This is an awesome manga, and is very hard to come by, so please enjoy it to the fullest. The quality is quite high and it is in 10 folders, of each roughly 5 chapters per folder and around 45.png's per chapter. Please not this is in .png format and not in .cbr or a comic book reader format, so please be aware of this. 

If you would like to have it in .cbr format, and you are on a windows computer - the following steps can show you how to quickly covert it without any programs.

1. compress each folder - e.g. 1-4.RAR
2. &gt;make sure 'hide known file extensions' is UNticked.
3. change the .RAR extension to a .CBR extension, and wallah!! you have comic book reader formats.
