Stan Levey - 1956 - This Time The Drum's On Me (2001)

Bebop is spoken throughout this swinging set (a reissue CD), which emphasizes jazz tunes written since 1945, including George Handy's "Diggin' for Diz," "Tune Up," and Oscar Pettiford's "This Time the Drum's on Me." Drummer Stan Levey is the leader and he is properly forceful behind soloists, but the main significance of this set is the playing of the great tenor Dexter Gordon, who was otherwise almost totally absent from records during 1953-1959. Gordon is heard in prime form, joining a top-notch sextet also including Levy, trumpeter Conte Candoli, trombonist Frank Rosolino, pianist Lou Levy, and bassist Leroy Vinnegar. Excellent bop-based music. (AllMusic)
