Hi all,

So after reading all the stories about wallets being stolen etc, i thought i can assist myself and the community in the process

So after giving it some thought, i came up with Safe Wallet, a application that locks your wallet.dat file (or any other selected file) against any form of access. This is still a very early version, so locks and unlocks are going to have to be manual, but alas, I am working on a version where you will just give access to a certain process (eg. C:\program filesbitcoin.exe).

So I present you with the first official version:

Current version :
Go to settings and select either searched files (by default containing the word "wallet") or manually add a file. Note that searched file keywords can be changed and then hit re-scan.

Once you have files in the watched column, save and then tick them in the main screen to have them blocked. To unblock, just un-tick the box. Fairly straight forward for now, but lots of functionality coming in future releases

This is still technically a Alpha version so for any errors, suggestions or enhancements, please either PM me here or send a mail to me : bitcoin@systemtech.co.za (yes we have developers here in South Africa)

Enjoy
