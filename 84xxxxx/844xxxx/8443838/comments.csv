,wenex,2013-05-17T02:09Z,why does scalzi suck as a person? i see people say this in other threads. Or maybe it's the same guy. I love his writing. Did he do or say something that makes him a jerk in person?
,Armandur,2013-05-23T22:40Z,"This is not the complete ""Human Division"". This is just all the episodes stitchet together in order in a single epub. I know this, I did the same thing when I figured out buying all the episodes would be cheaper than buying the complete book. I then looked at the books description on Amazon and found out that it will be released with two additional stories."
