  The debut album from the Footprintz duo, Clarian North and Adam Hunter, has bold aspirations. On embarking on creating Escape Yourself they aimed to make "a real album", one that captures the imagination and, possibly, reels you back in later on in life, helping to re-capture the past but shifting with the added perspective that comes with age. Escape Yourself is an album built around the difficulty of growing up, the transition from youth to adulthood, where it often feels like your mature identity is escaping what you once were. It's this topic that the lyrics focus on, whether in confusion and alienation or hapless temporal celebration.
