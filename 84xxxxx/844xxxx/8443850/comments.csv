[H],Azrael,2013-05-06T16:34Z,V9 A7 cam audio
,Killher,2013-05-06T17:48Z,"A:7 is NOT a cam audio. WTF is the lower half of the scale for if were rating cams audio at 7? And if it IS cam audio, then fuck scene for all. BRRIP Is a VERY specific title."
,fryzboxx,2013-05-06T19:05Z,"V-8

,Liman_Bot,2013-05-06T20:52Z,"He could've stated it's cam audio,but still the screens/video QL is awesome! :)"
,mrknowitawl,2013-05-06T22:17Z,Cam audio? WTF?.... fucking douche bag.
,funseeker521,2013-05-06T22:52Z,No! Sorry but nobody can put BRRip if its a cam!! What's the fucking point of listing the source if you just gonna lie??
,vwetv,2013-05-07T00:39Z,CAM AUDIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FUCKFACE
,Killher,2013-05-07T00:44Z,"Precisely. These assholes can't steal iMAGiNE's Audio releases, So they don't even fucking try to replace the loss. The just slap bullshit together and call it BRRIP."
,musclestud1,2013-05-07T02:27Z,"CAM CAM CAM CAM audio.  Some echoing and like you're in a tunnel.  Also, some Russian audio mixed in also ... at the end!  Damn!!!"
,Gimpman83,2013-05-07T04:00Z,Horrible AUDIO! Don't waste your time.
,freeegatee,2013-05-07T06:17Z,Thanks much
,sammyboblammy,2013-05-07T06:20Z,i am disappointed that this is listed as BRrip.  If it is an honest mistake then I can understand that but I am curious as to how it is a 1080p video but then A SPECIAL FRIEND gave the audio.  I think that CAM AUDIO should have been in the title next to BRRIP. maybe 1080p video and Cam audio.  If you are going to put Audio: 7 then you should put that its on a scale for cams lol
,topeak,2013-05-07T07:32Z,"Audio is crap. Not cam, probably line, but crap nonetheless. 

Why is this listed as a BRRip, Scene? Is it a foreign rip with line audio dubbed in?"
,euphya,2013-05-07T07:36Z,yeah def has cam audio. None the less scene4all I thank you for everything you do.
,dafix123,2013-05-07T15:24Z,"This is not BRRip, look at the size of the video"
,doydot01,2013-05-08T08:55Z,"cam audio
A4/V8"
,socker34,2013-05-08T10:10Z,Fucking CAM-release.
,LadyLoki,2013-05-09T00:51Z,"Just to also chime in that this is not a BRRIP. I had to fix up the color and the audio best I could, but it still was pretty bad. Thanks for up anyways"
,JLAIII48,2013-05-09T02:41Z,"A: 3
V: 10

cam audio"
,deathsfeet,2013-05-10T09:39Z,"V-8 (not bad, but i'm spoiled by actual blueray quality, for the size can't complain)

A-6 (sounds like a speaker in a tin can but decent volume at least)"
,Kra3zd,2013-05-13T08:09Z,"I don't know what everyone is bitchin about... Have you actually listened to a cam audio, or did you watch this movie while sticking your head in a pool of water trying to drown your miserable self?

After reacing to comments I almost passed, but decided to give it a shot. It's a great copy with good sound. Anyone who says different is a retard. Thanx scene for the UL and Fuck all the haters!"
