Deadset mate. Are you above the age of 10? Shut the fuck up."
,riccogrosse,2013-05-11T04:18Z,Great quality! Thanks...
,meanstreets,2013-05-19T15:43Z,"Great quality, great movie! Better than THE DRIVER.
Even has SUICIDE in the soundtrack!"
,crazyoliv,2013-05-28T22:58Z,"this is a pure inde movie, and not of the very best brand. Looks like blue valentine (i.e. boring). Drive was much better cause stylish, females are pretty, a well paced scenario, character developement, perpective on human nature, ... This one is... boring, like intelo-boring-direct-to-festival. 
This isn't even a good movie. Even action sequence are boring... the boring-o-meter is pretty high on that matter.

Qwality is DVD."
,crazyoliv,2013-05-28T23:07Z,"Even Eva Mendes was boring! Not only boring, but with a harsh eating disorder and no make-up. The black dude use to play a very interresting charachter in *house of cards*, in there he is transparent.
How boring can a movie be so that real-life actors stop to feed themself in order no to be that transparent.
It is a very boring movie. Even the cinamatography is boring.
I watched StarTrek2 versus khan (1982). It was lame and boring (91%RT!!!). This movie is so boring that you can't concentrate enough to find it lame. 

I am right?"
