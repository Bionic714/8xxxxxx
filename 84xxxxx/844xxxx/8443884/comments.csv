,scorp1133,2013-05-07T12:03Z,Do all the versions have the annoying HBO logo or just this one? 
,Meremoth,2013-05-08T05:29Z,"@scorp 

It seems like all the ones labeled ""Dual.Audio"" have the HBO logo.  There's a bunch of other ones that don't have i, though, specifically the ones downloaded from the internet aka ""web d/l""."
