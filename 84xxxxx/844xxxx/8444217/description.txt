The last time Fleetwood Mac made an album together, they were minus Christine McVie and enough good songs to fill its 75-minute running length. TheyΓÇÖre still without McVie on their new four-song EP, but they fixed ΓÇÿSay You WillΓÇÖΓÇÖs biggest problem by keeping ΓÇÿExtended PlayΓÇÖ at an economical 17 minutes. And if it sounds more like a Lindsey Buckingham record than an actual band one at times, at least ΓÇÿExtended PlayΓÇÖ is the best thing released under the Fleetwood Mac moniker since 1987ΓÇÖs ΓÇÿTango in the Night.ΓÇÖ

In fact, ΓÇÿExtended Play,ΓÇÖ which is available exclusively on iTunes, sounds a lot like BuckinghamΓÇÖs recent solo albums, but with a punchier rhythm section and Stevie NicksΓÇÖ backing vocals. All of which give the music way more life than if Buckingham ΓÇô whose insular approach to his solo records often make them sound thin and narrow ΓÇô would have recorded them himself.

The opening ΓÇÿSad Angel,ΓÇÖ propelled by acoustic guitar and a killer hook, crackles with more energy than anything the band or Buckingham, who wrote and sings lead on all but one of the EPΓÇÖs four tracks, has done in years. It doesnΓÇÖt hurt that Nicks and Buckingham still make a great singing team, chiming in on the choruses like itΓÇÖs 1977 again. The song is the highlight of ΓÇÿExtended PlayΓÇÖ and its only real uptempo track.

But the remaining three songs are almost as good, especially the closing ΓÇÿMiss Fantasy,ΓÇÖ a shuffling pop number featuring a whispered vocal by Buckingham, with Nicks pushing along the choruses. The hushed piano ballad ΓÇÿIt Takes TimeΓÇÖ is mostly Buckingham until the final minute, when strings swell around the spare melody. And Nicks and Buckingham share lead vocals on ΓÇÿWithout You,ΓÇÖ a leftover cut from the pairΓÇÖs pre-Fleetwood Mac duo days written by Nicks.

Fleetwood Mac have been performing a couple of the songs on their current tour, so in a way, ΓÇÿExtended PlayΓÇÖ doubles as a show souvenir for fans wanting new material from the band. ItΓÇÖs not essential Mac by any means, but after all these years, and all these years apart, itΓÇÖs nice to know that theyΓÇÖre still capable of making some sweet music together.
