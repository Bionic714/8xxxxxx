Egypt: Finding the Pharaohs
Fifty years before the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, Frenchman Auguste Mariette and German Emil Brugsch worked together to identify and decipher the contents of the tombs where the Pharaohs were laid to rest. They discovered the names and dates of Egypt's earliest Pharaohs, and they found the tomb of the greatest Pharaoh of them all, Ramses II.
