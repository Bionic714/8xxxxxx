This book contains dozens of new monsters found in the Inner Sea regionΓÇöall invented specifically for the Pathfinder campaign setting! Some, like the gearsmen of Numeria or the moth-like star monarchs who serve the goddess of dreams, have been mentioned many times in Pathfinder Campaign Setting books, but others, like the alien vespergaunt or RahadoumΓÇÖs desert-dwelling whirlmaws, have only been obliquely illustrated or mentioned before. And someΓÇölike the mysterious and ancient veiled masters, and the disturbingly alluring fungus queenΓÇömake their appearance for the first time in print after debuting in PaizoΓÇÖs office campaigns.

-Five new 0-Hit Die races ready for you to customize as villainsΓÇöor playable as characters if that suits your particular game!
