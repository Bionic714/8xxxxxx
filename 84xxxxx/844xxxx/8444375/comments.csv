Are they from GOG.com or something? 

|This has a 32 bit installer to install on modern |computers from xp to Windows 7.

Even if it has an installer, does it use dos-box? 

|I had some problems whit X-Wing on Windows 7 |64x the concourse looks bad but when i play the |game everything works fine dont know if it is just |on my computer or something else.

What kind of video card do you have? I assume you haven't tested it on windows 8 yet?

Do all of these support joysticks/pads?

Again, thanks!"
