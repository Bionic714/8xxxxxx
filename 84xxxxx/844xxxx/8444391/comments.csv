In abject violation of the Second Amendment, American lawmakers have for decades willfully, intentionally, and traitorously violated their Oaths of Office.  In particular, they have destroyed the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which reads:

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

The Militia is not the National Guard.  As is clear from any knowledge of history, the Militia is any able-bodied citizen.

The intent of the Second Amendment is not to protect hunting nor self-defense.  It is to empower the governed to overthrow the government should it become tyrannical.

There is no question as to this intent, and any argument to the contrary betrays only a shocking ignorance on the part of the person making the argument.

Over the course of the 20th Century, successive generations of would-be tyrants masquerading as Congressmen, Senators, Presidents, and Judges have sought to pull the teeth of the Second Amendment.  Today, in abject violation of it, the United States has over 20,000 victim disarmament laws.

We can no longer defend ourselves:  neither from tyrants in government, nor terrorists, nor street thugs.

This is about to change.

The Liberator is the first 3D-printable gun.  You may freely download these plans and print your own.  You will have available to you a gun capable of firing a .380 caliber bullet.

And no one -- not your next door neighbor, nor your mayor, nor your Congressman -- will know that you have it.

This is the first in what will become an avalanche of undetectable, untraceable, easy-to-manufacture weapons that will turn the tables on evil-doers the world over.

Share and enjoy."
