ripnotes..:

If anything binds the tangle of styles that rock Orjan
Nilsen's productions, it's energy. And there's plenty of
that served on his new one. The second single of his
upcoming album is the shiny, big-room loaded 'Violetta'!
Hot off the dark shaded 'No Saint Out Of Me', the
Norwegian producer sets the tone with another 7 minute
work of art. The pre-taste of what awaits us of his
second artist album, the follow-up to the successful 'In
My Opinion', is more than promising. It's unlike any of
his previous works, yet carries that unmistakable Nilsen
sound. Building at a right speed, rapidly unfolding its
melodic character and kicking in right after its break.
That's what 'Violetta' is all about. Another tune that
deserves the Armind halo on top.

Enjoy!
