Blue Break Beats, Vol. 1-4 contains Blue Note's four exceptional volumes of funky

 soul-jazz rarities and obscurities in one slip-cased box set. This box set may not 

appeal to listeners who already own all four discs, since there are no new liners or 

bonuses, but anyone who's about to invest in the set should consider this, since it 

offers all four at a savings. And if you get one, you'll probably want to get all 

four, so this is a good way to get 'em all at once.
