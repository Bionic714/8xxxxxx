Growing up in New York City, George Carlin was always the class clown. He went on to become one of the greatest comedians of all time, with appeal that spans generations. His brand of provocative sociopolitical commentary and scathing comic style brought him four Grammy awards, most recently in 2002. Carlin was the first-ever host of NBC's Saturday Night Live, and has starred in twelve HBO specials. He continues to perform to sold-out audiences at venues across the country. George's Best Stuff is a compilation of Carlin's legendary routines, including "A Place For My Stuff," "Dogs and Cats," Vitamins," "Baseball and Football," "Losing Things," "Al Sleet the Hippie-Dippie Weather Man," the notorious "Seven Words You Can't Say on Television," and many more. A great collection of some of the best standup comedy ever performed.
