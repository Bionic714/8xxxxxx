One year before Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans released Lifeforms, their breakthrough album as Future Sound of London, the duo recorded Tales of Ephidrena as Amorphous Androgynous. Charting an intriguing fusion of industrial techno with the free-form organic passages that would become the norm in ambient techno several years later, Tales of Ephidrena was the first hint of what was to become the trademark sound of FSOL.
