Carving Mirages is the first installment of the new Chillbasics compilation series from the Chillbasement netlabel. Consider it an invitation to enter a dreamlike wonderland of evanescent illusions blurring into a vanishing point on the horizon. Crossing the unmarked boundaries between psychedelic chill out, soothing downtempo, and deep ambient, this compilation features 14 tracks forged by new and promising artists intent on weaving stories of the intangible while experimenting with sound at the edge of consciousness. With artwork by Daniel Spacek.
