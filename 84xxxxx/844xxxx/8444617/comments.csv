,Astriel,2013-06-01T21:56Z,"1. Install (License Manager) skipping license installation.

2. Install program (Cadence SPB 16.6).

3. Copy entire contents of folder ""AspirinCadenceLicenseManager"" to ""C:CadenceLicenseManager"" overwriting existing files. (If copying stops on file in use, stop ""Cadence License Manager"" service in computer management/services)

4. Copy entire contents of folder ""AspirinCadenceSPB_16.6tools"" to C:CadenceSPB_16.6tools"".    Locate and run with administrative rights the ""Tools.cmd"" script in destination folder. 
   The script runs from 1 to 5 minutes depending on the speed of your computer.

5. In folder ""AspirinCadenceLicGen"", use a text editor to open file ""src.lic"". 
   Change ""this-host name"" to the real name of your computer. 
   Save the file.

6. In folder ""AspirinCadenceLicGen"", find and run script ""LicGen.cmd"". This will generate a license file ""license.lic"".

7. Start the license server configuration program: Start -> Programs -> Cadence -> License Manager -> License Server Configuration Utility. Specify the ""license.lic"" file as generated in the previous step. Click Next. You should see message indicating the successful startup of the license server.

8. Enjoy!"
