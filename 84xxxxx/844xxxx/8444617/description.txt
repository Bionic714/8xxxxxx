Cadence Design Systems, Inc. announce that hotfix version 6 for 16.60 release available. A hot fix is a software maintenance package containing a small number of code fixes, designed to fix a small number of critical problems. A hot fix enables a customer to receive fixes for urgent problems, without having to wait for the next service pack.


Cadence Design Systems, Inc., a leader in global electronic design innovation, launched the Cadence OrCAD 16.6 design solution with new features, enhanced customization 

capabilities, and 20 percent simulation performance improvements that provide customers a shorter, more predictable path to product creation.

This latest release offers numerous improvements to tool usability and performance, but at the heart of 16.6 are three key benefits: enhanced miniaturization 

capabilities, timing-aware physical implementation and verification for faster timing closure, and the industry-s first electrical CAD team collaboration environment 

for PCB design using Microsoft SharePoint technology.

Cadence enables global electronic design innovation and plays an essential role in the creation of today's integrated circuits and electronics. Customers use Cadence 

software, hardware, IP, and services to design and verify advanced semiconductors, consumer electronics, networking and telecommunications equipment, and computer 

systems. The company is headquartered in San Jose, Calif., with sales offices, design centers, and research facilities around the world to serve the global electronics 

industry.
