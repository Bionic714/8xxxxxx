Both copies...the original from 1951 and the remake from 2008.  In my book the original was and is much better than the remake.  The remake didn't follow the story line as I thought it should and they changed the story too much from the classic movie.  The 2008 version does have much better special effects, but after all technology has improved by leaps and bounds in 57 years. You decide for yourself which is the better movie.
