i've had to convert BeechyBoy's avi to work for me..

use  AVS Video Converter v8.3.2.533[A4] Fully activated

go here> http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8461952

start with ""profile"" use the pull down arrow and select->MPEG-4 (DivX, Xvid), 1500 kbps; Audio: MP3, 192 kbps

ps-- don't forget to make a folder for your finished movies shows and your format set ""To AVI""

y'll be surprised how easy it is to use.. "
