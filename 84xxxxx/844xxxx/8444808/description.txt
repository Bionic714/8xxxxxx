Here is the official torrent of the DVD-iso from Debian, 64 bit-version,
Debian 7 called 'Wheezy' from May 4th 2013.

It comes along as a live-dvd which allows you to boot and enjoy the newest
Debian distribution without installing it to your harddisk.

If you like the distribution, feel free to install it via the Debian
desktop later on...
