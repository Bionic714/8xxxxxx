Principles of Marketing takes a practical, managerial approach to marketing. Continuing with tradition, it is rich in topical examples and applications that show the major decisions that marketing managers face in their efforts to balance an organisationΓÇÖs objectives and resources against needs and opportunities in the global marketplace.

The Fourth Edition has changed to reflect marketingΓÇÖs ever changing challenges. All preview cases, marketing insights and end of chapter cases are revised or completely changed to embrace the growth in e-commerce. In addition, recognising EuropeΓÇÖs internationalism and the growth of globalisation, examples and cases are drawn, not from Europe alone, but from the US, Japan, South-East Asia and Africa.

This is suitable for any undergraduate or postgraduate undertaking an introductory course in marketing.
