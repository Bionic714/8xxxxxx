Bitcoin blockchain dump up to block 234830


This torrent should help reduce some of the bandwidth needed by Bitcoin nodes and spread it across the massive torrent network.

Hopefully if there's enough fast seeders, it will allow for very quick download of the blockchain for new installation of the Bitcoin client.


Enjoy!


NOTE: You might need to run the command "bitcoind -reindex" in order to reindex and recheck the blockchain.
