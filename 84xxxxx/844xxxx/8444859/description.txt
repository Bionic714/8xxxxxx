Book Description
Oracle SQL Tuning with SQLTXPLAIN is a practical guide to SQL tuning the way OracleΓÇÖs own experts do it, using a freely downloadable tool called SQLTXPLAIN. Using this simple tool youΓÇÖll learn how to tune even the most complex SQL, and youΓÇÖll learn to do it quickly, without the huge learning curve usually associated with tuning as a whole.

Firmly based in real world problems, this book helps you reclaim system resources and avoid the most common bottleneck in overall performance, badly tuned SQL.  YouΓÇÖll learn how the optimizer works, how to take advantage of its latest features, and when itΓÇÖs better to turn them off.

- Quickly tune any SQL statement no matter how complex.
- Build and tune test cases without affecting production.
- Use the latest tuning features with confidence.

What youΓÇÖll learn
- How and why complex SQL goes wrong
- When statistics are crucial and when they are not
- How and when the tuning facilities of the database can help or hinder
- When to tune and when not to tune
- Which steps in an execution plan are crucial to performance
