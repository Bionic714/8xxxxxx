[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-06T20:34Z,"LOL tdurden83, hey imagine what FCBD will look like in a few years if the industry turns to mostly digital distribution. there might literally be hundreds of FCBD titles!

you're welcome Seana11, glad they're reaching the target audience.  :-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-06T20:40Z,"still hoping to see scans of ninja turtles, the archie digest, absolution and bleeding cool from avatar, harbinger wars, the sonic/mega man flipbook, stan lee's chakra and most importantly the valiant masters preview."
,nickwenz27,2013-05-07T07:59Z,Thanks again for all the great comics..i have an older request but do you have Captain America 5 of Marvel NOW? I cant seem to find it anywhere. THANKS!!!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T13:21Z,"nickwenz27, this is cap #5:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8279630/  what happened was the scanner put the wrong number on it and i didn't fix it."

,Ahlat,2013-05-07T15:06Z,Thank you STFmaryville! Have The Strangers and Killjoys FCBD issue been uploaded yet?
,BSnapp,2013-05-07T15:34Z,"If you got to pick 3 comics at the store on FCBD, you're lucky..Our store had barely any traffic, and the owner says, ""One comic per person""...."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T17:47Z,"Ahlat, here's Killjoys (it was part of the Mass Effect issue, so collectors can delete the ME comic that was in one of my torrents -- this is the whole thing thanks to Son of Ultron.)

[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-07T20:14Z,"BSnapp, we don't even have a local comic shop anymore. but we do have a hastings, which participates in fcbd. they give out 10 per person, and if my wife goes, we can get 20. usually we just get 10-15 total because after that point i feel like a greedy neckbeard. lol"
,phoenixgenesis,2013-05-08T00:29Z,"With Digital releases of FCBD, I agree you would get more comics, but half the fun is actually going to the comic shop.

Once of my friend's had a hard time even finding a comic shop that participated and when he did, he could only pick out 4 comics. I guess I really lucked out because the 1st local shop we hit gave out about 25 and the 2nd one gave out so many I could hardly fit them in my backpack. Then I went to 2 more store in the afternoon and the last one was giving out back issues from last year (which I missed). Overall, I have a pile of 130 FCBD comics. What I won't keep, the local library is always happy to have."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T14:36Z,"libraries with graphic novel collections are so cool, my local library just crams them into the ""teen"" (twilight, et al) book shelves.

part of the problem with the direct market is that they have the cost and limitations of ordering and shipping the physical, paper copies. the digital market means the ""storefront"" never runs out of the walking dead FCBD, for example, probably never has to place a limit on downloads, and so on."
