I've posted the 2 Marvel FCBD comics, the 2 from Image and the 2 from DC. I also threw 10 others (including Damsels Mermaids, NFL Rush Zone and Worlds of Aspen) in a torrent.

Bongo (Simpsons) and Marble Season were posted by blackcanary. Here I've thrown together 14 more from various indy publishers. Some great stuff in here, mind you. I'm still just unmotivated to separate them all.

If someone sees Avatar's offerings or anything else that's missing, please share. Seed whenever you can, so everyone can try all of this year's previews and new series introductions. --STFmaryville
