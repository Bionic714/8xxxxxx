Sorry for being late but I rarely check back my releases. Let me know if you need help or have questions. Best thing is to post on my last uploaded torrent (eg here https://thepiratebay.sx/user/-Gabe-/ )

Would be great to share your web itunes movies here :)

You got it GABE...check them out. http://thepiratebay.sx/user/Gritzen/"
