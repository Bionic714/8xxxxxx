Amber Nash and Jordan Neff have been inseparable on and off stage, performing as Shiny and the Spoon-an eclectic, ukulele-centered, folk-pop duo. Jordan insists that he is the ΓÇ£SpoonΓÇ¥, although Amber will tell you otherwise. The duo gives off the warmth and intimacy of the likes of Johnny Cash and June Carter, with originals that are soulful and clever. In a live setting, the duo is able to quiet a large crowd with haunting, minimal instrumentation and lilting harmonies only to rile the room up again with foot-stomping, a pounding lagerphone, belly-rumbling bluesy vocals, and the occasional rockinΓÇÖ kazoo solo.

Within a few months of making music together, Shiny and the Spoon made a name for themselves in the local Cincinnati music scene. Their music has been subject to interviews with CincinnatiΓÇÖs CityBeat Magazine, WNKU, and ICN6TV, and LexingtonΓÇÖs Red Barn Radio. Their debut EP received rave reviews from multiple sources including AmericanaUK, Call It Folk, and FensePost.

In 2009 Shiny and the Spoon made their Midpoint Music Festival debut where they were deemed a ΓÇ£Cincinnati Bell RingerΓÇ¥ (reserved for ΓÇ£cutting edge bandsΓÇ¥). They were also invited to showcase at CityBeatΓÇÖs BRINK New Music Showcase for up-and-coming local bands, and were nominated for a 2009 Cincinnati Entertainment Award for New Artist of the Year.

Nash and Neff continue to draw larger and larger crowds at their local shows and are frequently described in print as a ΓÇ£local favorite,ΓÇ¥ and a ΓÇ£band to watch.ΓÇ¥ ItΓÇÖs not uncommon to see the crowd singing along to their favorite songs and calling out for more of those rockinΓÇÖ kazoo solos.

The duo recently became a trio with the addition of Mark Utley (of Magnolia Mountain) on upright bass.

Shiny and the Spoon released their debut EP to a packed house in January of 2010 and are currently working on their first full-length album set to come out in late summer 2011.
