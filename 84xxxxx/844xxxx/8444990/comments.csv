Me thinks this is a book for idiots who prefer to dream instead of face REALITY. Freewill? No chance, but not knowing what is coming next is best; Purpose of life? None, EXCEPT the one we invent to motivate us to keep on living; many believe nonsense and waste their lives doing so, besides being ripped off by the religious vultures.

We can face reality AND dream; they're not mutually exclusive. 

Best wishes."
