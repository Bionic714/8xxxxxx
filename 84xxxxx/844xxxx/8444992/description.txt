Recorded Live 1-4 April 2011 - Sarasota, FL: ΓÇ£The ShA-DahL-UUN Rite, the 12 Virtues and the Shores of Ah-MA-ya-sanΓÇ¥; ΓÇ£Planetary Mirror in the SkyΓÇ¥ Activation-1 & Crystallization of the Luminary Body.

During this April workshop, Team Indigo-Aquafereion not only laid essential foundations for the Sliders 10, 11 and 12 workshops but also took a HUGE step towards its eventual union with the Aurora Earth Planes through activation of the Aurora Water Crystal Generators, activation of the ShA-Dhal-uun Rite (Rite of passage into the Adept level of training), personal chakra induction of the 12+1 Virtue Codes, Crystallization of the Luminary Body, the Residency Adept Invitations and the Mirror in the Sky Activation Level-1. For the first time, the information and healing program released in this workshop are from the Book of KaLA Um-Sha TaRA, one of the Holy Books of the Mashayahana Master Council Elemental Adept Cloisters. The 12+1 exquisitely beautiful Virtue Codes, each with its own unique core encryption code, Man-dhΓÇÖa-LA code, name, tone, quality and four components, are interwoven with multiple layers, and together create the Man-dhΓÇÖa-Lic Shield of Virtues, and the ΓÇ£Wheel of the Eternal Virtues of Ka-LAΓÇ¥. Together they represent collective Fields or Gestalts of Consciousness within the Aurora Field that form a Blend wave that creates a link between NET Earth and the Middle Edon Domains. Their introduction to our technique repertoire signifies an enormous acceleration in our personal healing and training for slide, not to mention in our multi-level perception, our projection abilities and our ability to communicate with our multi-dimensional Kristic family and associates. They will bring us a step closer to becoming fully aware of, and atomically blended to (through Luminary Body crystallization) the co-existing reality fields of NET Earth.
