After a truly amazing and comprehensive Sliders-1, 2 & 3 program, this FOL workshop will definitely be remembered for its atmosphere of Celebration for the Kristic Mission. FOL 2009 also marked a clear and positive turning point in the ability for Team Indigo (and all who choose to come on this Journey on NET Earth) to engage more fully their own personal lines of Kristic communication and transformative healing. The orientation lecture was no less action-packed than any other, covering subjects like the ΓÇ£Budd SelfΓÇ¥ and its place in relation to the Elum- Eiradhona Spirit Body, the Orb people, the Ah-RAΓÇÖ-yas (introduced in St Kitts) and their ability to increase and maintain our Light Quotient┬╕ the Uni-genetic Underlay (UGU) and the Inner Sun of Aquarie. The workshop then kicked off with a run through of a selection of the Sliders-1 and -2 techniques including Induction of the AllurΓÇÖE-ah Rashatan Code, Creating the TEΓÇÖa-Wha Vision Seed, Activating the Organic Pentagonal Circulation and Activating the Grail Window Parts A-E. Then after a brief update on the Treaty of Al-BhenΓÇÖ-Yhan and the Krist Fall Host, Team Indigo called in the first of the AquaiΓÇÖ Solar Luna Transmissions (AquaiΓÇÖ-ah de So-LaΓÇÖ-RA LUΓÇÖna Ah-VE-yas Elemental Living Light Transmissions), Median Earth pulses that travel at nano-speed and which will continue to build between now and 2230. After this, lecture topics included the Red/White and Green electorate maps in North America, the Load-Out Charts, the Milky Way ΓÇÿAΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿMΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿPΓÇÖ Gates, the artificial Procyak Grid holding the Bloom of Doom at its centre, the role of Methane Deposits, Sink Holes and the twisted NET Earth Rod in fulfillment of the Omega Kill Code, the interconnectedness of NET Earth, Median Earth, AshalA, ShaLa and Urtha, and the second expansion of the Shield of Solomon/AdorA, a global network of Kristic energetic structures that can override the Omega Kill Code activations. The final lecture consisted of a wonderfully detailed update on the Chronology of the Cosmic Drama, where the number of Kristic Mission Upgrades far outnumbered the number of Drama Escalations (Drama Escalation # 28 to 31 and Mission Upgrade # 27 to 38 are covered in the supplement).
