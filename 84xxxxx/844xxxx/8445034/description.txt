This wonderful Drum Circle FOL workshop kicked off with some very important information on the enormity of the ΓÇ£Cosmic Picture,ΓÇ¥ the Indigo-Aquafereion Shield NET-Earth ΓÇ£wrap-up crew,ΓÇ¥ the unstoppable and destructive consciousness collectives on NET-Earth today, our unsustainable lifestyles (hot running water, refrigeration, etc.), the growing movement of eco-awareness (driven by the ΓÇ£Green DragonΓÇ¥ collectives), and the shift in consciousness that will allow us to shift what we ΓÇ£energizeΓÇ¥ here on NET-Earth (by shifting our ΓÇ£Encryption LatticeΓÇ¥). There was also information on the Monadic Passage, the Transharmonic Merkaba Field, and the nugget of pure joy ΓÇ£requiredΓÇ¥ for the drumming, dancing, and singing at the Drum Circle event at Siesta Key Beach. On Saturday, background information for the Drum Circle included the Level-1/2 Ordination, the Elemental Command Stand (similar to the one in Ireland), the joyful drum / stomp / slap-and-sing session (included the Psonn of Freedom Drum Code and the specific EtorA Monadic Activation), the Orb Call amplification, the AmorAea Krystal Temple Activation and the Mashaya-Hana Baptism Rites. The Monadic Passage pillars open into certain parts of the brain (similar to the Mashaya-Hana Vortices) so we can develop our own ability to receive frequencies ΓÇö and information ΓÇö from Urtha directly. The AmorAea Krystal Temple at Siesta Key Beach was to be the first of the Krystal Temples to be activated and the last of the Krystal Temples to close before the Load-Out. There was information on the NET field, the Met NET or Metatronic Encryption Lattice, and the creation of a natural Encryption Lattice, which will be aligned with the one on Higher Earth and with the Solomon Shield and the two-mile wide AmorAea Krystal Temples.
