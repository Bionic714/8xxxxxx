Can you please please please go back to encoding new movies to mp4 format please????

You are the only source that I've going to because of the quality and most importantly it's usually always in MP4."
,pro346pro,2013-05-08T05:20Z,Mkv is a much better format than mp4 it allows dts sound like this rip and even basic bluray players should play it or you could buy a cheap media player like the wd HD media player which plays all formats
