The Oblivion contained here has all that you seek, save the Construction Set, which I didn't think to include (Wyre Bash 303 is included in the Skyrim package), albeit only Skyrim is in my own personal install package. Arena and Daggerfall setups will not change from this pack, as they are full featured and work brilliantly, as they were put together by fans of the old games since Bethesda allowed them to be distributed freely. Battlespire, Redguard, Morrowind, and Oblivion all have potential for being made into one of my repacks, but I'd have to find the time."

Okay, good work. Right now i think about differences of 5th Anniversary Edition and GOTY Edition of Oblivion game. I think the first one has easier installation."
