Release Info:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Worms The Revolution Collection is the definitive gathering of everyone's
favourite garden-dwelling grenadiers. It features Worms Revolution, the latest
game in the best-selling turn-based series, plus all three DLC packs and, as
an added bonus, Worms 2 Armageddon and all five DLC packs.


Notes:
~~~~~~~

Both Games and all DLC Packs are on disk, selectable from a nice Menu.
Don't confuse this Collection with the ""Worms Collection"" from 2012.

Game works when burnt to Disc, or simply copy contents folder to hdd like
on previous XBLA Collections.


                      Enjoy This Fine COMPLEX Release"

Don't hit play directly from disc, region code error will show up, play this from My Games menu instead"
