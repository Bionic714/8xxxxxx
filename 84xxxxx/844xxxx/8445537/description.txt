And yet another Inspector Canardo book.

Inspector Canardo 11 - A Filthy Little Pile of Secrets
Canardo take on a seemingly simple case: an old man lies dying, and is unable to tell his daugher where he hid a a small fortune he managed to get hold on during WW2. Luckily, Canardo just got chosen as a test subject for a portable time machine, which should make the case a cinch. 
But some secrets are best kept hidden, and who knows what a filthy little pile of secrets might be hidden in the past.
