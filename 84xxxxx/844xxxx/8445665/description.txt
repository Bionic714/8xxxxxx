The young Valerie lives in an opulent home with her mother Frances and comes to realise that she is a prostitute who entertains many, mainly wealthy gentlemen. And very often Valerie finds herself peeping at the encounters between her mother and her guests. She feels bored with friends her age and she dreams of something more. Gradually Valerie is drawn into her mother's world of depraved passions and is at risk of becoming prostitute herself, thanks to her mother's pimp and with her blessings! However, Valerie unexpectedly falls in love with the father of her boyfriend Eric, a rich businessman. What will she choose: to follow her heart and stay with her lover, or repeat the fate of her mother?
