This is quite a frigg'n project you put out here...

Just curious,  WHY exactly is the 'original' Mono soundtrack better then  having a surround image, ESPECIALLY with a kick @ss action film...???

Seriously, I would very much appreciate your helping me to understand this since I an quite a serious Audiophile.

Thanks!!!"
,TheLathe,2013-05-07T07:53Z,"Oh, and I promise to seed for quite a while if I can understand why the quality of this one, A/V, is superiour to others.

I mean, you OBVIOUSLY worked your @ss off on it!

: )

Cheers!"

Kind of like the sound was recorded in a tin can. Most remixes for Hong Kong films suffer from this problem. 

The laserdiscs has 16 bit PCM sound at 1.5mbps. Mono, yes. But clean and robust."
,TheLathe,2013-05-07T20:51Z,"Most excellent!

Thanks again mate!!!"
,TheLathe,2013-05-09T07:52Z,"Well, I just was watching this, and I HAD to come back here and say how frigg'n GREAT the movie looks and sounds!!!  DAMN fine job mate!

Seriously, the sound is quite good; I thought FOR SURE that I would miss the surround sound, especially with all the shooting and action and all, but honestly, the sound QUALITY is so good that I don't really miss the surround that much...

I guess the original print as far as the picture quality goes is likely the best that it will be.  Don't you think though that it WOULD be nice if they gave this Classic film the full restoration treatment?

Thanks again and AWESOME job!!!"
