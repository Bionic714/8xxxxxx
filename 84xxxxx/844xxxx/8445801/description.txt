HARD BOILED, true 1080p Japanese transfer. NOT AN UPCONVERT.

FORMAT.......................: H264 BluRay
FILE SIZE....................: 24 GB
FRAME RATE...................: 23.976 fps
LANGUAGE.....................: Chinese
SUBTITLES....................: English

Audio is original theatrical, in 16 bit 2 channel PCM mono. 
This is vastly superior to the terrible 5.1 remixes we have 
had on all DVD and BD releases. 

Brand new English subtitles, properly translated. 
Must be turned on with remote. NOT FORCED.

SEED PLEASE! No seeding means the hard work put into this was all for nothing. And it was very hard work. Over 40+ hours were spent on the audio.
