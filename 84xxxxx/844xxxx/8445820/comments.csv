[H],shirepirate,2013-05-07T18:11Z,"to fix the sound issue some experience in Windows 7 or Windows 8, simply download and install OpenAL.
it is the oalinst software package located here:

,jimbus80,2013-05-14T17:59Z,Is this updated with the patch 1.1?
,jimbus80,2013-05-14T18:00Z,"And is this multilaguage (English, Spanish, etc.)?"
,jimbus80,2013-05-14T18:10Z,"Is it updated with patch 1.1 and multilanguage (English, Spanish, etc.)?"
[H],shirepirate,2013-05-14T20:14Z,"it is multilanguage. if you want patch v1.1, download worldwide retail patch:
http://www.bioshockgame.com/support/
http://bayfiles.net/file/PLRh/Qwadnn/bioshock_v1.1_patch.exe

move the game executable to the folder the patcher looks at and install it before cracking. then you will need to use DETONATiON v1.1 crack instead of the ViTALiTY crack.

the game's save files are in a folder in My Documents, if you need to back them up."
