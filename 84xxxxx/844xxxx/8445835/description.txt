Art Simmons - 1956 - Art Simmons Quartet (2011)

Amazing work from a player we barely know ΓÇô American pianist Art Simmons, really smoking here in a late 50s session from Paris! The date's got a nicely rough-edged feel ΓÇô but really avoids any of the bluesy cliches that could sometimes creep in when players like this hit the French scene. And instead, there's a sprightly modern feel to the music ΓÇô a mixture of Art's hard-yet-lyrical piano lines with the guitar of Terry Donahue ΓÇô supported by the great rhythm team of Bill Crow on bass and Dave Bailey on drums!
Simmons has a very rhythmic approach to playing ΓÇô maybe one of the best of the 50s generation to work in the style ΓÇô and titles include "Art's Blues", "Homage To Neal Hefti", "The Lady Is A Tramp", and "Nice Work If You Can Get It". CD also features 8 more bonus tracks from the same time ΓÇô featuring the same group, but with vocals from Bertrice Reading ΓÇô on cuts that include "Love For Sale", "No More In Life", "Rock & Roll", "Black Coffee", and "Left Bank Blues".
