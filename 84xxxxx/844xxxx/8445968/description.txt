From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, May 6 edition of Alex Jones' worldwide broadcast, Alex covers the latest on Israel's invasion of Syria as the region teeters toward all-out war. 

He also breaks down his plan to protest the secretive Bilderberg confab in the United Kingdom following his call for the corporate media to cover the event.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
