,pythonista99,2013-05-07T20:10Z,Come on man - you can see there's no seeding and 600+ leechers trying to get this - can you burst it up a bit please ????
,ariane_c,2013-05-07T20:37Z,"What do you suggest I ""bust up""? It's a book, can I help it if leechers won't seed after downloading it? I've never had this happen before so don't be so mean."
,pythonista99,2013-05-07T21:27Z,"Well - clearly you did do something - for which we are (ALL) appreciative.  Thank you.  By ""burst it up"" I meant for you to not throttle the seed.  BTW - my upload:download ratio was 16:1, so I gave comfortably more than I took."
,ariane_c,2013-05-07T21:46Z,I never throttle my uploads!  But my torrent client crashed!  I got it going again and set this torrent to HIGH instead of normal! Thanks for your help seeding!

Can you possibly upload the Fashion Sketchbook by Bina Abling as well please??"
