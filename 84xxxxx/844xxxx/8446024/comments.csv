,KitMalice,2013-06-09T10:53Z,"Everytime I look in the comment section I see a bunch of leeching, greedy uncontributing whiny bitches begging for whatever theme.  Well I do have most of these themes you guys ask for..but I come from Demonoid where I contributed because most members there uploaded files to share with users.  If you are not uploading content on TPB to help out your fellow users then you have NO RIGHT in my opinion to request things.  You want people like myself to upload these themes you ask for? Well how about taking the time to find stuff to upload to Pirate Bay? "
