,some-young-guy,2013-05-07T06:19Z,"Sample quality suggests that it's a revamp of the earlier release, cleaned up audio (less echoy, but still a little echo).  The sample does not show if the bad static noises are in this release though.  Video is a little cleaned up too.  No where near as much haziness, and the lines are way cleaner.  Colors look more realistic.

Cam ratings;
V-7.5
A-6.5 if the static remains, 7.5 if that too was cleaned up."
,edkabayo,2013-05-07T07:51Z,Please stop place the same version again and again

,Mrpell,2013-05-08T19:36Z,"@mrwolf71

It's amazing just how many scam/fake torrent's have been uploaded in the last few weeks for just this one movie. And yet they keep trying to con more suckers. 

Much better off waiting for a real blueray release later this year and either buy it or wait for groups like YIFY to do a 720p and 1020p rips without all the fake RAR files with passwords crap."
,dash34,2013-05-09T03:21Z,DVD or brrip plz?!
,splatt99,2013-05-09T04:15Z,this is very watchable ... for a cam its great the audio is much better in this copy than the last one ... if you are a huge ironman fan just watch it ... you are going to watch it again on bluray anyways 
,splatt99,2013-05-09T04:17Z,i would rate this cam V7 A7 i loved the movie and cant wait for the next one
,DxDan,2013-05-09T04:31Z,"One of the two, either record the movie yourself or don't freaking upload the same copy all over again"
,omgzelda,2013-05-09T10:42Z,"Very watchable if not very shitty quality. 

V: 5
A: 4

M: 9 (movie was great, lots of laughs.)"

Not watchable unless you're that guy in the restaurant that likes to eat all the scraps for free."
,Nemo89,2013-05-09T18:54Z,"It would be watchable, but it's still the same crappy copy with missing over 12 minutes (Cuts every now and then). I don't understand why you're fixing the audio to a copy with missing video."
,Nemo89,2013-05-09T18:57Z,"V: 2/10 (missing 12 minutes)
A: 6/10"
,Beetlejuicexx,2013-05-10T12:19Z,"You can add sutrosta to the list of idiot faker usernames on pirate bay, too.

Do not listen to sutrosta or anyone else that mrwolf71 has mentioned. They will try and scam you."
,s3x665i,2013-05-10T12:30Z,"Hi , tell me is this movie before or after the avengers ?? ! "
,IACSC,2013-05-11T03:46Z,"@s3x665i,
This takes place after The Avengers, hence why it was released after The Avengers film, and why the suit looks so different."
,chuck1953dec,2013-05-11T04:35Z,"Why even bother commenting on a bad or bogus upload? I read the description, take into consideration the source, read the comments and THEN decide to download or not. Opinions are like assholes....everybody's got one. "
,s3x665i,2013-05-11T11:20Z,"@ IACSC
Thanx man i know now that the timeline was after the avenger cause, iv just watched it in the big screen,
im a big fan of Marvel and DC .. but dident like this last one, its a good movie but i  expected more ... im a bit disappointed..."
,rreining7,2013-05-12T02:08Z,THANK YOU .BONE. All these people bitching about the quality when it's clearly labelled a camrip are retarded. Thanks for your work.
