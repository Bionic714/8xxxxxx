The Firm continues the story of attorney Mitchell McDeere and his family 10 years after the events of the feature film and the novel by John Grisham.

As a young associate, McDeere brought down the prestigious Memphis law firm of Bendini, Lambert & Locke, which operated as a front for the Chicago mob - and his life was never the same. After a difficult decade, which included a stay in the Federal Witness Protection program, Mitch and his family now emerge from isolation to reclaim their lives and their future - only to find that past dangers are still lurking and new threats are everywhere.
