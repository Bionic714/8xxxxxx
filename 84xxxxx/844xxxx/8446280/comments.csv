,dafix123,2013-05-08T13:46Z,Why do people lable these as  BRRip-s if the video is 640x272? Even DVD has a higer quality...
,tdurden83,2013-05-08T22:20Z,"why do people keep posting the exact same comments about vids being labeled BRRip? If seeing the source labeled in the title gets them so butt-hurt, you'd think they would stay away and stop downloading and/or whining about them.

Thx for the great quality considering the very manageable size"

,highlander888,2013-05-14T16:27Z,"Thanks for the upload!

Great quality!

The movie itself is awful! I guess Felicity must be pretty hard up to star in a crap film like this."

,michelledelis,2013-05-26T03:03Z,its weird when i download a torrent then come back to my account I end up loseing the person that I downloaded the torrent from so I really cant leave a comment. I'm leaving this comment before I download. And I'm hopeing it comes out ok. I'm new to torrents so I just go to anyone and download a movie. Can you give me any advice or knowledge of what I should be looking for in a movie to download? And what the difference is with the abbreviations
,DSfreakazoid,2013-05-30T14:59Z,"@michelledelis
green skull = good

,zoner2001,2013-06-04T01:55Z,"I love how people post their opinion of the movie... this is a torrent site not rotten tomatoes . com. NO ONE gives a shit if you liked the movie... all we want to know is if the quality is good and if it's legit. Obviously if i've come here to download it I've already made up my mind and reading some anon idiots comments on how ""this movie blows chunks"" is not going to change my mind... go to a fucking critic site if you want to post your opinion of the movie otherwise shut the hell up and quit bitching... YOU'RE DOWNLOADING IT FOR FREE ASSHOLE. P.s. THANK YOU UPLOADER!! V: 9 A: 10"
