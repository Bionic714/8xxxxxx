Our next FCUP is 'Twilight Man', a four-issue mini from Steven Grant and Tristan Schane.

After a nuclear explosion tears a rift between dimensions, the Tyrant Gods seek to return to Earth. In an interview, Mr. Grant said of Twilight Man, "I'd done TWILIGHT MAN at First, essentially an attempt to modernize the sword-and-sorcery genre, which I've always had a soft spot in my head for but which is generally dismissed, not without reason. (TWILIGHT MAN is itself a lost story, the published version being nothing like what I'd originally planned, except for the second issue that reconfigured the Great God Pan as an incestuous child molester; that alone survived more or less intact from the original version. What never saw print was a savage critique of Reagan administration policies, which is what the book was really about.)"
