Stress can kill. Chronic stress has been linked to depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Left untreated it can cause serious and long-lasting health problems. Drawing on two decades of clinical research into the effects of stress on the brain and the body, For the Love of Stress is designed to help you learn to control your stress and live a happier, healthier life.
