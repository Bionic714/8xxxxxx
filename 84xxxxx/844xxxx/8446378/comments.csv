,bgg1175,2013-05-07T18:00Z,"I like McFarlane and wish hed get Spawn back to were he was before McFarlane got sideswiped by Tony Twist and Neil Gaiman with their crap lawsuits that they somehow won. 
I had a subscription to Spawn from around 130 to 200 before I finally decided the comic was not entertaining me. 
I keep checking it out for free here but all I see are boring comics with plenty of facial shots. 
Wish we could have the Spawn inside the comic McFarlane keeps showing on the covers.
Thanks for posting these so I can check them out for free. "

I couldn't agree with you more, I too dislike the current spawn art BUT I still think that he's one of the best comic book anti-hero character ever made :)) That's why I'm still enjoying it"
