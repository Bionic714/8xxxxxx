I'm posting here since chances are you'll see this sooner, being your latter upload. 
I'm having troubles playing Science is Fiction that you have uploaded http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8418871/Science_is_Fictione___23_Films_by_Jean_Painlev_amp_eacute_
I can't play the disks in either VLC or Power DVD. Can you please tell me if you are experiencing similar issues?
Thanx, ZGNN, and keep up the great work! "
