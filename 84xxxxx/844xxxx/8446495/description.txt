Aaron Ash, "Gorilla Food: Living and Eating Organic, Vegan, and Raw"
ISBN: 1551524708 | 2012 | EPUB | 208 pages | 6 MB

Raw food diets have exploded in popularity in recent years; some believe that the cooking process destroys nutrients and even produces dangerous chemicals by the interaction of heat with fat, protein, and carbohydrates.

Enter Aaron Ash, a charismatic chef whose organic raw vegan restaurant Gorilla Food has taken Vancouver by storm for its inventive and delicious dishes, all prepared without use of animal products or a stove. Aaron is a conscientious raw vegan whose beliefs about food are tied to personal and social well-being. Gorilla Food strives to promote the idea that a sustainable, healthy culture depends on humankind living as "lightly" as possible, mitigating the damage wrought on the environment and ourselves.

Gorilla Food the book is both an innovative cooking manual and a raw vegan bible; recipes include a raw lasagna made with zucchini noodles, kale, and a "cheese" made from walnuts, and a raw soup made from seasonal greens, tomatoes, and avocado. There's also amazing raw pizzas, fruit pies, and chocolate desserts that will delight vegans and non-vegans alike with their complex flavors. The book also contains recipes for dehydrated and cultured foods, important for a raw food diet but surprisingly simple to prepare.

Gorilla Food will make you go ape for living life to the rawest!
