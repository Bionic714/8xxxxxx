BBC Radio Thriller by the always reliable RD Wingfield.

Harry, an explosives expert, is in the demolition business, blowing up old factory chimneys. But years earlier he used to work for the Section, an undercover part of the Ministry of Defence, and was involved in an assassination attempt on a rising black politician. An attempt is made on Harry's life, after one of his old army colleagues turns up on his doorstep - is this coincidence, or is Kabinda bent on revenge? Or is the Section up to its dirty tricks?
