[T],TxJag,2013-05-10T06:36Z,@seminoles85 kind of what I explained earlier with the Spenser books in general. There are A LOT of them and I know it's a well liked series and that people have also warmed up to Ace Atkins to keep it going. It's going to take some SERIOUS work on my part and I have to set priorities. But I can do a single book no matter what.
