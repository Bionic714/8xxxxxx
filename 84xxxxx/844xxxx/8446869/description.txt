Movie Info

Two teenagers find themselves growing up a bit faster than they expected in this drama from Germany. Katja (Tatjana Trieb) and Johann (Robert Gwisdek) are two best friends in their early teens who both dream of the world they will live in as adults. However, Johnann discovers he has leukemia, which puts his life in jeopardy and cuts Katja off from her closest companion. Things are not much easier for her at home; Katja's mother (Martina Gedeck) has been having an affair with Johann's father ({Heino Ferch}), and isn't sure if she should stay with her husband or move on. The theatrical-feature debut of television director Anno Saul, Gruene Wueste was well received in its screening at the 1999 Munich Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
