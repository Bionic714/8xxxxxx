This album contains the absolute worst playing I have ever heard from Sonny Stitt. I think he was probably drunk, but I can only speculate. Anyhow, they turn it down pretty low in the mix, and it is not particularly noticeable.

This is an otherwise fine album, I'm not really into "Shake Rattle & Roll" but it is short.

Really... it is a great album. I like it a lot.

I'll see what I can do to make it up to any Sonny Stitt fans who may have clicked their way to this page sometime in the near future.
