Born on February 21, 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina, Nina Simone received a scholarship to study classical piano at the Juilliard School in New York City, but left early when she ran out of money. She turned her interest to jazz, blues and folk music and released her first album in 1958. In the ΓÇÿ60s, she became identified as the voice of the civil rights and wrote songs about the movement. She died in France on April 21, 2003.
