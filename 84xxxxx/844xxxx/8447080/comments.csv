,TheDoucheBeater3000,2013-05-07T20:19Z,"I, unlike some parasitic pieces of roach dung, am grateful for the consistent uploads.  Uploaders do not profit from providing these torrents.  They are not obligated to perpetually seed for your convenience; when they are able to seed, they shall do so.  If you cannot wait for the uploader to allocate the time, resources, and electricity to seed, then go to Hulu and shut your face.  Enolena, you are nothing more than a mere stain upon the Underwear of Life and that hard to wipe area on all our crevasses (the part that perpetually smears regardless of how many times one may wipe).  Go pound sand.  Mickedee77, you have my many humble and grateful thanks."
,mickedee77,2013-05-07T22:39Z,"Thank you for your comments. I continually have my computer running seeding these files, however from time to time I have to stop with seeding as I need to use the internet connection to rip the new episodes.
I can understand your frustration when something is not seeding properly, but I am currently doing 9 soaps every day and that requires a lot of offline time in order to get the best possible video for all to enjoy."
,capnkidd,2013-05-08T02:37Z,"Thank you very much for uploading these , you have my wife very happy "
,Enolena,2013-05-08T07:20Z,"Dear Douche...well...what can I say except that you are really a douche. I was asking mickedee77 to seed a file that has been up for 2 days now.  Thanks mickedee77, for I am now stuck at 78.3%. Since this is Monday's episode and we are now into Wednesday, I calculate that I will have Monday's episode on Thursday.
As I said before stop uploading what you cannot seed.
When I download something, I seed it from 2-5 days just to ""give back"", so I'm doing my part.  As for you Douche, I will go back to HULU because you aren't there."
,mickedee77,2013-05-08T10:15Z,"Wow Enolena, you really are an ungreatful piece of trash. I posted a comment to explain why computer is not always seeding, yet you still want to badmouth me. I don't have to spend my time capturing these episodes and uploading them for people, I do it as a my way of helping people out. If your not happy with the work I am doing, then go elsewhere and stop posting nasty comments, that is just so rude."
,mickedee77,2013-05-08T10:25Z,"Oh and another thing Enolena, I only uploaded this torrent 24 hours ago, so it has NOT been up for 2 days, nowhere near that."
,jharbert78,2013-05-08T13:52Z,thanks for your efforts. I will seed each episode for about a month as often as I can. thanks again and much appreciated
,Enolena,2013-05-08T17:27Z,"I am so sorry for my remarks of criticism for your efforst, mickedee77.  

You really are doing a great job by putting these soaps up for us.  Thank you so very much for what you do."
