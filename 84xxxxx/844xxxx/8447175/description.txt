What's cool about it:
Enhanced graphics with double the video playback resolution over the original CD-ROM release.
Dozens of different locations ranging from mythical Atlantis, to the harmonious valley of Shangri La, and even the golden city of El Dorado.
Gripping plot with many twists that will keep you entertained for hours.
Assume the identity of 18 characters and experience their ancient cultures first-hand, using the "Chameleon Jumpsuit".
Overview:
Thousands of years ago the great civilizations of Shangri-La, El Dorado, and Atlantis had vanished. Behind their mysterious disappearance lies a legend of power and destruction that will ultimately determine the future of humanity. As Gage Blackwood, Agent #5 of the Temporal Security Agency, you will travel through time, assume multiple identities, and weave your way through an intricate web of puzzles. Hidden within these lost worlds lies the key to mankind's survival.

Journeyman Project 3 is a worthy installment of the franchise. A fascinating story, memorable characters, and puzzles that are both fun and intuitive are only the tip of an iceberg of what this game has to offer. The third installment features gameplay improvements like a first person perspective view, and the new "Chameleon Jumpsuit" that lets you interact with characters form the past. Also, Jerry Rector does an excellent job playing Gage Blackwood. When compared to the previous installments, this one is everything they were and more. If you are a fan of the series than this is a no-brainer. If you havenΓÇÖt heard of those games before then this is a good place to start, even though this is the third part, because the story exists independently from the previous ones, and the production values and gameplay are top of their class.
