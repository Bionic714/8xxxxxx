,ChingaTuu,2013-05-08T03:39Z,"...Itchy, any chance of following up this First Comics feed with a Pacific Comics one? A ""Captain Victoru"" one would be most welcome, as the final three issues explain the significance of the whole series and how it's related to Kirby's ""Fourth World"""
,Ichthypod_Crane,2013-05-09T02:55Z,"ChingaTuu, Sorry, I don't have much in the way of Pacific Comics. What I DO have is some of the series that Eclipse picked up from PC, and those will see daylight during the Eclipse Upload Project to come."
,Greggmcg,2013-05-12T15:38Z,"Awesome upload! Badger and Grimjack were the two series I picked up when I first got a job. Great stuff. I still remember the ""gut wrenches"" line from the Hexbreaker GN. For some reason that stuck in my head."
