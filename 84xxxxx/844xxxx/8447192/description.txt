Its nostalgia time! The 80's was my golden era of music. So I have scanned an old book of mine for the 80's lovers!
It is a graphic chronicle of the music events from mid-84 to mid-85. US and UK top 20 weekly singles and album charts are included.
Its making was a bit resource-heavy on my hardware/software. So I had to split it in 4 parts & then combine them into one PDF. But you won't see all that in the final edited book - its almost as good as a true PDF. I have OCRed it with bookmarks. You will find in it:

- ACTS OF THE YEAR: PRINCE, SADE, WHAM!, U2, BILLY IDOL, MADONNA, CYNDI LAUPER, NIK KERSHAW
- EVENTS OF THE YEAR, BAND AID
- QUOTES OF THE YEAR,
- TRENDS, FASHION
- BEST AND WORST AWARDS
- REVIEWS OF THE MAJOR ALBUMS, SINGLES, VIDEOS, BOOKS
- REPORTS AND ANALYSES OF THE YEAR IN ROCK, REGGAE, HIP HOP, JAZZ, BLUES, SOUL, ELECTRONIC
- BUSINESS AND THE MEDIA
- UPDATES ON EUROPE AND AFRICA
- EXTENSIVE REFERENCE LISTINGS

THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND OCCASIONALLY OBJECTIONABLE ROCK RECORD AVAILABLE
