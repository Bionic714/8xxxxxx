Roadside Graves, who honed their ramshackle sound on 2010ΓÇÖs You WonΓÇÖt Be Happy With Me EP, are back with their newest full-length, We Can Take Care of Ourselves, a companion piece to S.E. HintonΓÇÖs classic novel The Outsiders.

The album isnΓÇÖt a retelling of The Outsiders or even an analysis, but it ruminates on the same themes and references the characters and settings. The scrappiness of the band fits the mood well as does their folk rock style.

String arrangements, such as those on ΓÇ£All Over the World,ΓÇ¥ add a cinematic flair to We Can Take Care of Ourselves suggesting the album is meant to be more of a soundtrack. Like a soundtrack, knowing the source material is not necessary, but it certainly adds to the experience. For instance, ΓÇ£Teenagers are TiredΓÇ¥ is still a gorgeous and moving acoustic ballad whether or not the listener is thinking about Ponyboy and Johnny, but the experience is more immersive if they are.

Overall, We Can Take Care of Ourselves feels slower and more restrained than the previous EP, but there are a few songs that energize the record like ΓÇ£Hank WilliamsΓÇ¥ which opens up with a jumpy piano riff and escalates into a barroom romp.

The instrumentals really stand out. The hard-rocking ΓÇ£Tuff HairΓÇ¥ and the haunting piano-synth duet ΓÇ£HospitalΓÇ¥ add depth and display immense musicianship.

While nothing on here matches the power of the epic ΓÇ£Liv TylerΓÇ¥ on their last EP, We Can Take Care of Ourselves shows that Roadside Graves are willing to take risks conceptually and that makes them one of the more compelling Americana rock bands playing today.
