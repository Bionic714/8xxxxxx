Iron Man 3 2013  FULL CAM NEW AUDIO XViD - JUSTICE



SOURCE : video beowulf / Special Friend
        audio Special Friend

Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....


Ok had a new source shared with us but was lower Q ...and had a small res of 352x however the audio was
better and the film was complete ( check runtime of 1hr 59mins 47secs compared to the rest ).

So....took our rip of the beowulf release and resyncd this new audio and also added the missing video in
aswell 

Both video and audio have all been cleaned aswell and would be here all day stating whats been done....
So check the sample and you'll see how the 2 videos blend together to full missing scenes.
