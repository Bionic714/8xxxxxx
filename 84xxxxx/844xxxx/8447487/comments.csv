Please please please bring back MP4 file formats. Every other HD torrents are in MKV so it's pointless to be yet another one.  You were basically the only last MP4 1080p poster.  Please bring back MP4!"
,pro346pro,2013-05-08T06:18Z,plenty of people doing mp4 format most of the kingdom guys do 1080p mp4 similar to tomcat rips and besides mkv allows dts sound either way it doesnt matter as all tomcat rips are perfect quality
,sisse1972,2013-05-08T12:42Z,"thanks guys,sometimes i realy dont now what to do,for me the video quality does matter and not so mach the audio,if the audio is DTS the file has more value insted the AAC but to see the difrence you need a stand alone player who can produse DTS (I DONT HAVE).
i love kingdoms work until ""secretmyth"" left the group after that most of the kingdom
encodes was CRAP but  still the ""kingdom""  works in the end of the file.

my friend temp1992 is very easy and no encode need to make in your pc the mkv file into a mp4 aac, just go to ""videohelp site"" and download the (MkvToMp4)change the mkv to Mp4 without reconverting/transcoding video sose the raw video is the same in both Mkv-Mp4 conteiners .."
,temp1992,2013-05-08T20:14Z,"@ others.  Those other encoders like Kingdom, don't regularly post mp4...and most are only in 720p.  Sisse1972 was the only last remaining 1080p regular poster.

@sisse1972
does this mean you will no longer post in mp4??  Please no!  Please encode in mp4.  Every other torrent HD poster encodes in mkv anyway."
