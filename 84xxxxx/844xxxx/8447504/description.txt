Vintage collects unreleased material from the New Riders' prime, when the band's line-up included guitarists David Nelson and John Dawson and featured the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia on steel guitar. While the opening cuts represent some fairly strong country music, as the album progresses the playing begins to grow increasingly lifeless and mediocre; for the most part, the music on Vintage went unreleased for a reason.
