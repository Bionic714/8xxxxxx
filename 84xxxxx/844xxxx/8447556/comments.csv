Is this one the same?"
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-07T23:39Z,"No, there is no German here... hence the ""PROPER"" in the title. The aspect ratio is also correct on this one."
,THRobinson,2013-05-08T03:13Z,"Well ""Proper"" has German if you lived in Germany. :D But that's good... downloaded 5 copies and all I think were re-encoded from the 3Li file."
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-08T12:41Z,"For scene releases, a ""proper"" could never be German, unless you're talking original German audio for a German film, which this is not."
