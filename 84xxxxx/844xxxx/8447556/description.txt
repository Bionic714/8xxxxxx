Acrobatic Chinese Imperial Guard Chon Wang comes to the Wild West to rescue beautiful, kidnapped Princess Pei Pei. Upon transporting her ransom, Chon finds himself on the very train that Roy O'Bannon, an outlaw of dubious competence, plans to rob. They reluctantly become partners when faced with bad-seed Marshall Van Cleef who'd rather neither one of them make it off the train alive.
