,andyfukinj,2013-05-09T09:17Z,"Since all these fool loser-ass spammers were talking shit on YIFY's uploads  ( My personal favorite uploader of good stolen movies) , I thought I would let everyone on here know there is actually a YIFY website out there you can download from......"
,Karnager,2013-05-09T15:06Z,"subtitles are totally off, how can you include a subtitle that doesnt match, you imbecile"
,meskiman,2013-05-09T22:22Z,Subs is not in sync.
,xaxax,2013-05-17T22:37Z,"Wow... why do idiots keep giving YIFY a V:10.
By nature, YIFY encoded videos cannot be over 6/10 due to poor quality compression (and reaching its small size by running filters that destroy the quality in general)

Compression is not your friend, get real internet and download quality rips, lossless audio, etc. No reason not to these days."
,KwadLazer,2013-05-18T09:15Z,@LiL_Crunk have you tried ps3 media server?
,-GetCrunk,2013-05-23T19:06Z,@LiL_Crunk get free studios or something and convert the video. to avi or a supported codec 
,alwaysodd,2013-05-29T05:08Z,"Video and audio are excellent, like I expected from YIFY.  But, don't try to use the subtitles for any reason on this one, they are all kinds of messed up.  I'm gonna try to download just the subs from his 720p version and see if it's any better."
,necrovamp,2013-06-05T04:07Z,"Pretty good attempt at a suspense movie in this age,  much better than any paranormal activity

cant even compare"
,u2att,2013-06-09T17:36Z,Thanx again. Yifi is one of the few that I trust. Excellent again. As usual
