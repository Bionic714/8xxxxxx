You need windows in order to run the keygen.
You can do so by emulating a windows inside your osX.
For noobs or people too lazy/busy to install a virtual machine I accept to give you the authorization files.
Send me your request code to:

,milgax,2013-05-16T21:06Z,"Great, works just fine! 
One thing tho. To get instruments and Melodyne for example, Studio One requests Presonus username and password connected to the product. 

How to solve this?  It doesn't work creating a new account on their website as it's not connected to the product."
,milgax,2013-05-16T21:23Z,It seems the product key is licenced to Team AiR (ofc). Is it possible if you put a torrent up with all the instruments and additions you can find under Studio One > Studio One Installations? 
,akun91,2013-05-17T01:54Z,"Hey bro ! If you want to change the license register name just put whatever you want in the keygen (you can modify it!).
For the Studio one instruments, well i'm afraid to say that I can't support that feature on this release, sorry.
But if you want to get the integrated melodyne editor to work here are the instructions :

-Download this one : http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7573294/Celemony_Melodyne_Editor_2.1.0.45_Win_(cracked-R2R)_[ChingLiu]

-Run the installer,

CAUTION !

In the first steps select :

*The VST3 (32bit) plugin if you work w/ S1 x86
and place it to your 32-bit VST folder (if you are on windows 32-bit it is C://Program Files/VstPlugins generally, on windows 64-bit it is C://Program Files(x86)//VstPlugins)

*The VST3 (64-bit) Plugin if you work w/ S1 x64
and place it to your 64-bit VST folder
(C://Program Files/VstPlugins)

*Or both

// It should run just fine after that, to use it, run studio one, right click on an (already) recorded audio track (not a midi instrument), then ""audio"", and ""edit with melodyne""

,stratotak,2013-06-05T00:30Z,"It will not show Reason 5.I down loaded demo from site and ran it and ran it in demo mode and Reason 5 didnt show up,"
,akun91,2013-06-05T01:25Z,"@stratotak
The demo version of reason doesn't work in rewire (that's a limitation in order that you buy their software)
If you want to get it working uninstall your demo version, and download and install this one:
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6337121/Propellerhead_Reason_5_[CRACKED]
then you'il see it in the rewire peripherals of studio one."
,stratotak,2013-06-05T04:20Z,"https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6337121/Propellerhead_Reason_5_[CRACKED

That is the version of reason I have. It doesnt show up in Studio One with the version in your download.
I downloaded demo of Studio One to see If it was same as verion in this torrent.
I dual boot 2 versions od Win7x64.One running bare services.The other stock setup.Thought it might be a service disabled but it does same when I install in stock Win7 x64.Reason is not in Studios vendor section."
,stratotak,2013-06-05T04:22Z,Also I know its not a Reason issue because Reaper works fine with Rewire and Reason.
,stratotak,2013-06-05T04:29Z,Reason works with reaper so it is a issue with this release.
,stratotak,2013-06-05T09:21Z,"Ok .. Reaper works with Reason 5. Studio One shows Reaper as a rewire device and works. I downloaded older version of Reason 4. Same problem.I have tried to install into 2 different locations.  
Programs(x64)
Programs
No dice ...Not sure why S1  doesn't pick up Reason."
,akun91,2013-06-06T23:14Z,"Hey stratotak !
As Reason is 32-bit only, make shure that you have installed the 32 bit version of Studio One.
The daws must be equal in bit depth (32-bit+32bit/64-bit+64-bit).
Hope it may help you."
