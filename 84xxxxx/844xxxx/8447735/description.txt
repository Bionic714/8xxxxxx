This book is a study of the 'Great Movies', that fluid category of feature films deemed by various authorities - film societies, critics, academics, and movie enthusiasts - to be the enduring and memorable works of cinematic history. But what are they about? In 'Wit's End', the author attempts to 'make sense' of these films in order to understand their greatness in the context of their relation to other films and to the worlds they come from and recreate on screen. To that end, we employ the conceptual power of pragmatic social theory and the rich idea of aesthesis to explore and arrange these films as a means of understanding what they express about the universality of human life in our keen use of wit, organization of social wont, and direction of cultural way. It is hoped that such an inquiry will illuminate the glory of the great films and contribute to the advance of film studies.
