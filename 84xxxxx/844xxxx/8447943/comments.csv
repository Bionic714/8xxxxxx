,the_dude74,2013-05-07T15:51Z,"How do you mean, exactly?"
,Ahlat,2013-05-07T16:35Z,I mean is the point of it just for nearly naked drawn woman or is the story any good. I've never read cavewoman so I'm curious if it's worht checking out.
,the_dude74,2013-05-07T17:00Z,"Oh, gotcha. Well I'd say it's mostly cheesecake, but some of the stories are actually kind of fun; Pangean Sea, for example, was pretty cool. But you're not going to be reading anything close to Grant Morrison or anything. You might try starting with the original story and see if it grabs you. In short, though, Bud Roots curvy art is the real selling point."
