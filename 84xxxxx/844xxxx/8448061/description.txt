Notes:

I am not a fan of dubbing, but just in case there's anyone out there who would actually rather watch a foreign film with an English dubbed audio track, I included one as a secondary audio track. The original Italian is the primary audio track. Both tracks are stereo, 160kbps each. This is the newest edition to my "controversial films" type encodes. Apologies ahead of time if the subs aren't perfect. I don't speak French so I couldn't really verify these as well as usual and there weren't many sub files at all for this movie. It's very unrepresented, and very controversial. I'll say no more. :)

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

(My 1080p encodes will still look crisp and sharp on monitors up to 28-30", and possibly larger. The above paragraph primarily applies to 720p and below.)

Please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
