It also helps to keep your upload bandwidth going while you're DLing so people can get what you've already gotten. haha Thanks! :D"
,7117,2013-05-07T16:49Z,"yeah, haha, put it 'games' topic, your friend don't find it here under 'application'"

wait for mods, they remove it soon,"

,cri23cri,2013-05-08T18:24Z,if i have this game (The Sims 3) already can i download expansions still and use them with my purchased copy of sims3?
,aixtek,2013-05-09T06:20Z,"@cri23cri : I don't see why you shouldn't be able to. No expansion is tied to the base game, however you may still need a No CD crack. I'm not sure how that would effect your base game though since you have to replace alot of the .dll or .exe files. (yes, even those are used in Sims for Mac)."
,aekiameh,2013-05-09T17:06Z,"This does NOT contain all extension packs, just so you all know. Seasons, University, Supernatural are all missing. Would be nice to update that info in the description. "
,cri23cri,2013-05-09T18:42Z,"@aixtek so i can just run the expansions to install them to my base game? im not quite sure i get what you mean by ""you have to replace alot of the .dll or .exe files."""
,Ricky9712,2013-05-09T20:33Z,when i click on the the sims 3 app it says unkown error has occured wat do i do i spent two hours downloading this and uploaded 30 gigs of it 
,aixtek,2013-05-10T15:31Z,"@Ricky9712: Did you put it in your applications folder? And more importantly, did you use the crack? here:   ..  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8452418/The_Sims_3_No_CD_Crack_(for_Mac) There shouldn't be anything you should need to do to get it installed, it's really just unzip and place in apps folder. Follow instructions in crack, voila! If you run into more probs msg me on fb ..url + ""aixtek"" at the end. I'll see what I can figure out in the meantime. "
,aixtek,2013-05-10T15:42Z,"@cri23cri : you should be able to download/install whichever expansions you would like with your base game. However, when you launch the game it will show as your last expansion you added. For instance, this torrent, when launched, begin running as ""The Sims 3 Showtime"" because it was the last expansion installed. It will also ask for the CD (this is where the crack comes in). In the crack you replace many of the .dll and .exe files that have essentially been cracked to ""trick"" your machine into thinking it has/doesn't need the Showtimes CD. (skype - ""recolligere"" if you need help still)@aekiameh : you're right, it doesn't. I apologize for that, I was going by the Dutch .apps in the contents folder when I should have gone by what it said in the launcher. That's my mistake, my Dutch is a little rusty. haha. However, I would love to edit it, but TPB doesn't allow us to edit torrents ourselves, I'll see what I can do, though. In the meantime, to everyone... NO This should be labeled ""The Sims 3 ALMOST COMPLETE"" aka ""The Sims 3 FREE"""
,AdrianaB2,2013-05-11T12:37Z,"Hey! Are you planning on uploading the rest of the expansions?! oh, and thanks for the game! Been looking for it! :)"
,aixtek,2013-05-11T15:42Z,"As much as I would love to upload the rest of them for you, it would be painstakingly slow with just me initially seeding it, no matter how many good trackers I put in. Besides, our good friends at Games4theWorld have already done this for you! :) Check out their page at http://thepiratebay.sx/user/games4theworld  there you can find all the expansions you want, plus some other useful things :)"
,aixtek,2013-05-11T15:46Z,"beeteedubs: they say PC on them, but you can install them on your Mac. It requires the Mac patch, which the launcher should ask you if you want to install. (Hint: if you downloaded the NoCD crack [also by G4TW] there a link in the Instructions.pdf on how to manually install this crack ^_^ )"
,chewboo,2013-05-12T23:14Z,"Hi, so I downloaded the games and applied the cd crack (which had worked previously on other expansions i had downloaded), but now whenever i click on the icon to start up the game it says ""Unknown error occurred"". Any idea what went wrong? thanks."
,aixtek,2013-05-13T04:17Z,"@chewboo: one important part that I've noticed some people skip is before you apply the last step in the crack instructions you MUST start the launcher and update it, then QUIT the launcher completely, then complete the last step. If that doesn't work, there is also a part in the instructions that tells you what to do (apply the Mac patch manually) in case of a failure. The link to the patch is in the instructions. Msg me on Skype (recolligere) if you still have probs and I'll try to walk you through it. :)"
,M6000,2013-05-13T21:11Z,"This don't work! Follow everything, when I ask for update it said ""no update available"", and it also says I've got version 0.000.000.000 of the game!!! And when I put the final crack, and launch the game ""an error had arrived"" !!"
,M6000,2013-05-13T21:20Z,"Don't work!! It said no Update, I aply the final crack and the ""an error accure"" !!! And it told me I'Ve got the version 00.000.000.000 of the game!!"
,aixtek,2013-05-13T22:33Z,"@M6000 It does work. I know it works. I have this same torrent on my computer and I was *just* playing it. I also know it works because I've walked multiple people through installing it and the crack successfully. I'm not sure what you may have done incorrectly, but *something* was done incorrectly. Maybe try installing the Mac Patch manually? That's also in the instructions.pdf... other than that, I don't know what to tell you."
,Ricky9712,2013-05-14T02:54Z,if only someone would post a video on how to do this cause im confused i dont know if its just me or watever but i think it would be easier if someone made a video on how to install this fully
,ninjaking203,2013-05-15T21:12Z,The torrent works well if you follow the instructions. I got it to work but there are some problems with the sims being slow to react. For example when going to work they would stand in the same spot and not move at all. 
,aixtek,2013-05-16T02:44Z,"@ninjaking203 : Ya know, I noticed the same thing. I thought it was just my system lagging but now that you're having the issue too I'll check into what it could be. "
,Marypossa,2013-05-16T15:04Z,"hi, aixtek, this didn't work for me at all. I already had an original base game, pets and seasons and downloaded WA, but when i dragged it into the app folder and started the game it just said that an unknown error has occurred. And then it messed up my whole game, because it said the same thing even when i removed it from apps. And i had to reinstall it. So what do you think it is? I didn't use the crack because i have the seasons which is tle last expansion i want to use (and i use a NoCD mod anyway). I'm not very handy with his, so are cracks needed even so? Thanks!"
,aixtek,2013-05-17T03:00Z,@ Marypossa: even if you already have the base game you still have to use the crack and apply it. What you should do (if you still can) is find the saved game files in your base game + expansions and copy them to your desktop/pendrive (anything) and install this game + apply crack -- then place your saved games in the new game install directory. 
,Marypossa,2013-05-17T12:01Z,"well, i thought that it depends on the last (most recent) expansion pack. as i said for example i want to install ambitions from your torrent, and i already have original seasons, so it asks me for seasons dvd. I still need the crack? And thanks!"
,aixtek,2013-05-17T15:29Z,"Yes, you still need the crack. However, if you're only wanting the one expansion pack, it's probably best you only download that expansion. Check out the torrents created by ""Games4theWorld"". "

,estefaniado,2013-05-18T15:57Z,"Hello, I have problems with the installation of the game. To play came in with the instructions you give me, but I asked the showtime cd to play. you could help me? thanks"
,chic0sci,2013-05-18T19:11Z,Hello im having problems running it on osx mountain lion.. I get an unhandled page fault read access error whenever im starting the application.. i applied all the no cd patches mentioned. anyone knows how to solve this? :) thanks
,alternate_z11,2013-05-18T22:16Z,"Don't bother wasting your time d/ling this. 

First, there's some complications with unzipping. Tried Keka, 7zX, Archive Utility and eventually had to use Archive Expander to get it to work. The file is basically damaged/packaged wrong(which may have caused further complications for me)

After expanding from .rar, the game's expansions are in the form of executables, not .app. This means you can't even browse its contents, which the crack explicitly tells you to do. It's not a matter of simply following the steps, because you can't follow them. Also, the names are in Dutch, so.

The normal Sims 3 gives an error, even with the crack applied. Followed the steps, skipping the ones I couldn't do (specifically the expansions). 
"
,ninjaking203,2013-05-19T00:52Z,I looked up the delayed sim interactions and it has to do with Late Night. At least for some other people. Also alternate_z11 your not supposed to use the expansions that come in the folder you have to click show package contents on the Sims 3 and not the expansions. If you followed the instructions correctly like I did it would work for you.
,chewboo,2013-05-19T02:06Z,"Hello, I couldn't get the game to work at all and kept getting the ""error has occurred"" whenever i tried to start it up, so i deleted all the files downloaded here. However, even with the files gone, I'm still getting the ""error occurred"" window. Is there a different way to completely uninstall this torrent so my game will go back to how it was before? thanks"
,nuuken,2013-05-19T13:28Z,"(Does it work on mountain lion? =) This seems almost too good to be true, but I'll give it a try anyways ;) When I downloaded the NL version of this, it worked perfectly the first time playing it, and when I tried to open it again, all I got was ""unknown error occurred!"". I reinstalled like three times, applied update cracks and everything, so I'm on the verge on giving up now haha. But thank you so much for doing this! If it wont work for me, at least it has worked for many others! Oh, and someone please seed :)"
,laser966,2013-05-20T21:15Z,"Hey, really my first time torrenting (don't judge we've all been here). I just was wondering, what's the best way to unzip this file? I'm a little confused."
,siriusluke,2013-05-21T13:59Z,Is the mac version compatible with Rachelstoolbox's store packs? http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8465948/Complete_Sims_3_Store_May_2013_(package_and_decrapified_sims3pac
,nowgtfo,2013-05-21T16:05Z,"when i tried to start a game, i got a message saying no game disc found blah blah"
,girlisgirly,2013-05-21T16:28Z,very good torrent. Works perfectly on Mountain lion 10.8.3. And it can be updated too.
,isiszizi,2013-05-21T19:56Z,"I got the same problem. When I click to start the game, it shows a message ""No disc found. Please insert the disc Sims 3 SHOWTIME""
I follow all your instructions. What do I do? Please heeelp!!"
,goodgal123,2013-05-24T01:40Z,"I still got all the files in Dutch somehow, so how can I change it to English? I already have the base game, so will it interfere with the disc images and whatnot?, because I keep getting errors when I attempt to install any expansion by just blindly clicking them."
,goodgal123,2013-05-25T08:01Z,"Hey  @aixtek the ""ultimate crack"" for MAC I got does not seem to be working. Extracted with Stuffit Expander they become .exe and .dll files...which are said to be for PC. How does this work for others on MACS??"
,aixtek,2013-05-25T17:24Z,"Yes, the cracks will be in .exe and .dll extension. That is fine, just follow the instructions, it will work. As for the ones getting the ""No Game CD Found"".... well, that's what the crack is for. Once that is done (step-by-step, do not skip any of them) then it will work. If you can't get it to work by following the instructions EXACTLY, I'm really not sure what to tell you. There is one way and one way only, and since I don't know what you did wrong, I can't tell you what to do differently.  And for it being in Dutch -- yes, my description explains why that is --- the game files were originally in Dutch because this was a Dutch installation----which means the UI, Game Launcher, Sim Maker, etc, were also in Dutch. So.... I changed all the IN GAME language to English... not that program files. That's what Google Translator is for, but you don't really need to know what those are anyway since the only .app you will ever access when applying the crack (and running the game) is the ""De Sims 3.app"" (which is... ""The Sims 3.app""......) Sorry if I'm sounding rude, but everyone keeps saying this torrent doesn't work---when it does. If you can't get it to work YOU are doing something wrong. Not the torrent."
,nicegirl830,2013-05-30T17:56Z,"I also am having problems with the NO DISC error...... and the main problem is that I can't find the instructions to crack....
I'm new to this so please bare with me.....
Are they in another language and I have to translate them? Cuz the only English file I see is the ReadMe file about the game itself..... I don't see any cracking instructions there......."
,AnneGall,2013-05-30T23:19Z,"Works great, thanks so much. Is anyone else not able to log in in the Sims online world though? It keeps saying I'm offline when I try to log in. Thanks"
,_Cakeman,2013-06-03T00:31Z,"All files are in Dutch, cant understand anything. Oh and you said to follow the instructions step by step? I CANT. THERE IS NO STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS. Not unless ITS in Dutch too and I cant find it anywhere..."
,_Cakeman,2013-06-03T20:26Z,"ATTENTION EVERYONE HAVING ISSUES WITH NO INSTRUCTIONS:
Go to aixtek's profile and see all of his torrents. There is a no cd crack torrent that you can download. THIS IS WHAT HAS THE INSTRUCTIONS. 

Anyway, I actually got the game working, and I have to say...this is actually BETTER than my copes of Sims3 that I purchased myself. My purchased copys always lagged really hard if I had just 1 other expansion pack installed. But this...this has almost every Sims 3 game, AND NO LAG. No glitches either! So thanks for an amazing upload."
,_Cakeman,2013-06-03T23:48Z,"Oh I need to ask one last question @aixtek

You mentioned that we can go to Games4theworld to get the missing expansions for this torrent...ok, well everything that they upload is PC version and is in all these .exe files. Ok, so lets say I wanted this:

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7601527/The_Sims_3__Supernatural_[FULL]___Games4theworld__

If I already applied cracks that you uploaded, then how would I install this correctly on OS X if this is Windows?"
