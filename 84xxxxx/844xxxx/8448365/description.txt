Tuesday 05-07-2013: Nate Silver - Statistician

Nate Silver is seen as a political astrologer with an uncanny ability to get it right. His prediction of the US presidential election result last year was spot on when most pundits were saying the race was too close to call. No wonder then that Nate Silver is being credited with re-shaping the art and science of political forecasting. But has he robbed electoral campaigns of their substance by reducing them to mere statistics and number-crunching?
