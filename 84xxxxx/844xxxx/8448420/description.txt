3 New Stories by Dash Shaw
Three full-color short stories exploring varied dystopian societies, from a Sherlock Holmes-style investigator who must complete his high school degree to filmed "voluntary" nudity to prison camps full of jaded children. "Dash Shaw is a modern comics master. He experiments with everything from structure to narrative to color. If you're unfamiliar with his work, he's sort of like Gary Panter illustrating a Chris Ware story, or, in this case, 3 stories of dystopian societies.

Very different comic from what I've read, and I'm pretty sure there aren't many like this. I wasn't fondof the second story, but I enjoyed the first one a lot and thought the third one was okay. Give it a try.
