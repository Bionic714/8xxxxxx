SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

Is it a legend, or a myth??? The one question has plagued mankind throughout the 
ages has always remained, but finally comes to unfold here in a new chilling 
Thriller. The Native American Indians thought it was fact... they respected, 
feared it and Believed to be a GOD. Ten Years ago, there was a "Ghost-like 
something" seen killing people in the dark unforgiving woods as people were 
culled away one by one and some never to be found. What really happened? This 
year reports have surfaced that it was all just a "HOAX"... But a local 
philanthropist believes different and puts a $2.5 Million Dollar Bounty on this 
"Beast" in the woods and a team of expert hunters go out looking for the "Silent 
Killer." But now years later it was never to be found and they dismissed it as 
an unsolved mystery! When BARBARA SANDERS and her free spirited college friends 
venture off into the deep woods of the Northeastern Valley Mountains to look for 
this so called legend and for a weekend retreat, their camping and canoing trip 
fun turns into FEAR in the FOREST and a dangerous roller coaster adventure ride 
when they each encounter the unspeakable terror! Now it's a serious struggle 
against Man Vs Beast in which there can only be one in the end. But just when 
you think you've figured it out and when you thought the nightmare was over, the 
real "HELL" begins... and now comes your worst nightmare into a reality... FEAR 
the FOREST - The Legend lives.... 

Enjoy!
