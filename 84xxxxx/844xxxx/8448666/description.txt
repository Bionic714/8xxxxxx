Sam Simmons' Problems (2012)

A sketch comedy series starring Sam Simmons and directed by Trent O'Donnell 


The show is Problems and itΓÇÖs led by Sam Simmons, the undisputed master of suburban absurdity. This bald man with a questionable moustache has spent the last ten years crafting award winning comedy, going from a cult hero on Triple J to an international superstar. 

Whether itΓÇÖs wrapping his head in ham, serenading stuffed owls, or disco dancing in his own specially designed bread shoes, Sam Simmons is one of the most thrilling live performers in the comedy arena. He is an evangelical advocate of bringing silly back to comedy.

He was nominated for comedy's most prestigious award at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2011 and this year took the Montreal Just For Laughs Festival by storm. He comes to Problems direct from Los Angeles and ahead of a return season in London's West End.
