Either way, there is a significant amount of leg skin showing.  And no nylon over the arse or fanny.  ""There's nothing sexy about a reinforced crotch"" !"

,pythonista99,2013-05-08T14:49Z,"I think one should always be perfectly clear about things like this.  If it's a body stocking, then he should say so.  However, I do appreciate the effort the uploader does, and especially that he provides snapshots/thumbnails.  I'm just fussy and pedantic.
