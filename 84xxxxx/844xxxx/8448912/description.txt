Ruby Andrews - 1998 - Hip Shakin' Mama

Ruby Andrews dropped her first single on Zodiac Records 31 years prior to this 1998 Ripete CD. Three decades later, the sweet innocence evolved into Ms. Hip Shakin' Mama, a mature woman who has been to heartbreak hell and back many times, and not the na√Øve young woman who wept out "Casanova," which was more drama than real (she didn't sound like she was quite over old Casanova, listeners knew she would take him back and get hurt again). Hip Shakin' Mama, however, wouldn't go for a playboy's love in a million years, and if she did, she'd be playing, too. She tells it like it is and how it's going to be on "Fishin' for a Man," "Yousa Hard Dog (To Keep Under the Porch)," and ten more soulful joints with no girly tears to water down the messages.
