[T],480v,2013-05-28T11:07Z,"Just to tell people. It's not that SteelerJ17 didn't include subtitles, It's just that the Criterion Collection DVD doesn't have them. You have to turn on Closed Captioning on your tv instead. Hopefully SteelerJ17 was mindful of this during the dvd compression. (idk if it can be removed like that, I'm not that knowledgeable). 

Maybe someone else can confirm whether closed captioning is still available."
