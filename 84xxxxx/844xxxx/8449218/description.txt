Called by Ken Russell "the greatest science-fiction film since Metropolis," controversial director Paul Verhoeven's Robocop is a special effects-laden cult phenomenon. The film features a resurrected and roboticized hero in a new, supercharged cyborg body, struggling to reclaim his memory and avenge his own death.
The unrated director's cut, including "excessively violent" shots cut from the theatrical release to avoid an X rating.
