When professional hit man John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) defies the orders of Mr. Wei, a ruthless Chinese drug lord, he knows not only is his own life at stake, but also the lives of his family back in China. Desperate to get home, but in need of a passport, Lee enlists the help of Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino), a beautiful document forger who helps Lee fend off waves of Wei's "replacement killers" - hired guns who will stop at nothing to see Lee dead.
