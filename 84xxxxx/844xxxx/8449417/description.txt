Episode Fourteen: "Reunited!"


Wigs fly as the queens discuss the drama of the season. Plus, both "America's Next Drag Superstar" and "Miss Congeniality" are crowned. The episode was filmed on May 1, 2013 in Los Angeles.



This is for the people who need it quick in small file size but with good and sufficient quality. You can always re-watch the show in Fabutrash's 720p resolution later.
