Since the latter half of the last decade, Alex Melia aka Reso has been blending heightened technological futurism with dancefloor prowess to create a densely cinematic musical universe. ΓÇÿTangramΓÇÖ ResoΓÇÖs much anticipated debut album was released in Nov 2012 and received heavy support from Mixmag (Album of the month), XLR8R, The Guardian, FACT, RA, NME, as well as other key musical luminaries such as Liam Howlett, Skrillex, Skream & Benga, DJ Food, Salva, Rusko and more. A landmark thirteen track odyssey that reaffirms the place of the ΓÇÿalbumΓÇÖ within modern electronic music, Tangram cemented Reso as one of the worlds most forward thinking producers

Tangram Remixed opens with KOAN Sound tackling 'Axion', pushing the tracks rhythmic possibilities yet further the OSWLA signed duo switch the glitching beat complexities into halftime stepping bliss. Remixer extraordinaire Om Unit perfectly balances 'Simple Pleasures' rich pads and dreamlike atmosphere with a slowfast footwork flux while Neurofunk god Billain delivers an exquisite and rare remix, a highly twisted take on the bass mechanics of 'Half Life'. Doshy closes the 12" with his unique neck snapping electro and trap infused rework of 'Coronium'.
The digital package also includes revisions of 'Check 1,2' by PhiladelphiaΓÇÖs Starkey (Amen breaks and 8 bar grime), 18 year old D&B prodigy Emperor, MunichΓÇÖs Danny Scrilla (Sub heavy dark, sparse ΓÇÿslower than it feelsΓÇÖ 85bpm O.G '06 bass) and Japanese 2 x DMC world Champion DJ Kentaro (beat-juggling, electro-workout with more edits than you can count) Plus remixes of 'Ishimura' by NYC's Drop the Lime (Dark shuffling techno) and Atlanta's Evol Intent (hard hitting DΓÇÖnΓÇÖB with a half time feel).
