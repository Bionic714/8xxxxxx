,DakotaSmith,2013-05-08T15:11Z,"The Defense Distributed ""Liberator"" .380 single shot pistol is a fully 3D-printable firearm.

In abject violation of the Second Amendment, American lawmakers have for decades willfully, intentionally, and traitorously violated their Oaths of Office. In particular, they have destroyed the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which reads:

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

The Militia is not the National Guard. As is clear from any knowledge of history, the Militia is any able-bodied citizen.

The intent of the Second Amendment is not to protect hunting nor self-defense. It is to empower the governed to overthrow the government should it become tyrannical.

There is no question as to this intent, and any argument to the contrary betrays only a shocking ignorance on the part of the person making the argument.

Over the course of the 20th Century, successive generations of would-be tyrants masquerading as Congressmen, Senators, Presidents, and Judges have sought to pull the teeth of the Second Amendment. Today, in abject violation of it, the United States has over 20,000 victim disarmament laws.

We can no longer defend ourselves: neither from tyrants in government, nor terrorists, nor street thugs.

This is about to change.

The Liberator is the first 3D-printable gun. You may freely download these plans and print your own. You will have available to you a gun capable of firing a .380 caliber bullet.

And no one -- not your next door neighbor, nor your mayor, nor your Congressman -- will know that you have it.

This is the first in what will become an avalanche of undetectable, untraceable, easy-to-manufacture weapons that will turn the tables on evil-doers the world over.

Share and enjoy."

now, this little plastic one-time-use gun is not really going to do anything except maybe for slipping it through security. but even if you are all against guns, at least get a real pistol, learn how to use it, and practice often, so that you will not be totally overpowered when the need arises.

Samuel Adams
quoted in the Philadelphia Independent Gazetteer, August 20, 1789, ""Propositions submitted to the Convention of this State""

""Firearms stand next in importance to the constitution itself.

George Washington
First President of the United States

""The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand arms, like laws, discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as property. The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside … Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.""

No, you are very dumb. In America corporations are so rich and (KEY) UNREGULATED, that they can influence government policy, because their actions affect the whole national economy. Also the fact that the President's who run for office have to have lots of money to fund their campaign, which means that most president's will be corporation friendly because they probably own a few and all their friends do. For example George Bush lowered taxes for all his oil baron friends in Texas.  

 OR they owe getting into office to rich people funding their campaign, and as a result they will be friendly to them if they get into office. (eg, tax breaks, change government policy to aid them) 

Also corporations can set up lobby groups to change government policy in any way, in the same way for example as the American Israel Lobby (includes neo-cons, AIPAC etc) which made the the invasion of Iraq happen. (I am not implying that they were the sole factor, merely that the invasion would not have happened without them.)

I am not being Anti-semitic by the way. I support Israel."
,teh-cheeseman,2013-05-19T09:10Z,"Therefore, government is not inherently corrupt, but rather the American Political system is just heavily biased, in that it keeps power in the hands of the rich, or at least ensures that their interests are favoured.

,Teh_Frm4terer,2013-05-28T12:45Z,"Okay, that's it. You gone damn done and made me comment on a torrent.

Dear Americans (and other countries with Second Amendment type bullshit),

Down here in Australia, we have this pretty sweet system in which anyone can buy guns! (I know right, it's pretty sweet). Now I say 'anyone' with a grain of salt.

You see, in order to get a gun in a backward, ""lefty"", ""green"", ""socialist"" country like ours, a person who wants to own a firearm of any sort jumps through a few hoops so that we know they aren't batshit insane, ex-criminals, or might go and shoot out a primary school! This includes psychological evaluation, gun safety training and the like. They also have to have to provide a 'Genuine Reason' they want a gun, whether that be hunting, collecting etc. Any sane person can jump these hoops, as long as they can be bothered putting in the time and effort.

Afterwards, that person gets a Firearms License! They can then buy a personal selection of guns, up to a certain number and degree of danger.

We still have gun stores. We still have gun ranges. You can still protect your family personally, if you feel it's necessary. Most people don't bother, because our police are trained to protect us, and if there was anything particularly dangerous happening, they can help us most effectively if we aren't pulling out our guns to help. In my 21 years in this country, I've seen maybe one citizen with a gun, and it was holstered. No gun violence, no shootouts, nothing. And guess what? The government haven't come to quash our freedoms. Last I checked, no paramilitary troops have kicked down my door to demand I kneel to their every evil whim.

Was this gun control behaviour a long-held byproduct of our old culture? No! After the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, we as a gun-toting country decided that we weren't going to let another 35 people die at the hands of some lunatic with a weapon.

Guns aren't freedom, anymore than guns are evil. Guns are dangerous weapons, and should be treated so. You want one? Prove you're responsible with one.

That said, I agree with TPB's policy on free information, so as far as the 3D printed guns go, it would be against my morals to argue against them being here. I really don't like the fact it exists, but it seems inevitable. This rant was more to do with the reasons they should be available, I guess. "
