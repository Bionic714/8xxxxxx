,Chubaloo,2013-05-07T21:44Z,"^ Transmission was showing corruption on the file. A far as I am concerned, this one is the one that is working."
,pythonista99,2013-05-07T22:29Z,"Ok - but then you should add a comment to all the others to ignore, and then say that this is the only valid one.  Can't leave people guessing !"
