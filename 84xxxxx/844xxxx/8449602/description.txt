In Dad is Fat, stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan, whoΓÇÖs best known for his legendary riffs on Hot Pockets, bacon, manatees, and McDonald's, expresses all the joys and horrors of life with five young childrenΓÇöeverything from cousins ("celebrities for little kids") to toddlersΓÇÖ communication skills (ΓÇ£they always sound like they have traveled by horseback for hours to deliver important newsΓÇ¥), to the eating habits of four year olds (ΓÇ£there is no difference between a four year old eating a taco and throwing a taco on the floorΓÇ¥). Reminiscent of Bill CosbyΓÇÖs Fatherhood, Dad is Fat is sharply observed, explosively funny, and a cry for help from a man who has realized he and his wife are outnumbered in their own home.
