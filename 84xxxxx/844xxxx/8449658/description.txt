Air Date: 2013-04-21

Steven teaches his son Payton that shooting up dad's property comes with a big price, while the rest of the crew tracks down hard-to-find collectables from the days of Al Capone. Meanwhile, Gran-Pa Biff has some bad news for the owner of a seemingly rare weapon, and two excitable brothers blast their ratty old fishing craft into boat heaven.
