Admired by women from all walks of life, you would think that she wouldn't be having any problems in the love department! However, words on a page don't necessarily translate into real life.

Arnie proves to be the inspiration Sarah needs to get her creative juices flowing. As their friendship develops into something more, Sarah's imagination runs wild.
