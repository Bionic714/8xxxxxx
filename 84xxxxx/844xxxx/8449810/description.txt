Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, May 7 broadcast of The Alex Jones Show, Alex takes a closer look at why Google Chrome is labeling Infowars and DrudgeReport.com malware, and breaks down why it is more likely that Western backed rebels, not the Syrian government, are deploying chemical weapons. 

Alex continues analyzing a proposed armed march on Washington D.C. and the implications it could have, and examines eyewitness reports regarding the Boston bombings stating police may have shot their own in a friendly fire incident. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes William Gheen of the Americans for Legal Immigration PAC to discuss why it's vital to the globalist agenda to erode national borders.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
