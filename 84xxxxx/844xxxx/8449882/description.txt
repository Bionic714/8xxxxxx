A radio sitcom set in a medieval castle. Estate agents, mail order lingerie and the invention of central heating: this is medieval England seen from a 21st century comedy perspective.

Thrill! as brave knight Sir William De Warrenne comes back from the Crusades and tries to buy a castle with a combined dungeon/gym.

Swoon! as young Lady Anne watches handyman Sam Tree grease a rusty hinge.

Sympathize! as lord of the castle Sir John hires the latest top-of-the-range horse, but can't work out what to do with the built-in ashtrays.

And get out your dictionary as the medieval equivalent of Gordon Ramsey tries to prepare a banquet with a mandolin and some very old swear words, and a medieval host has some trouble hosting the annual Strictly Come Gavotting competition.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: [quote]The Castle neatly blends together 'Ye Old England' themes with present day ideas to create a quirky and fun setting for comedy adventures. The characters are all neatly defined, and voiced with gusto (Steven Kynman as street-talking teenager Henry particularly makes us laugh). A very enjoyable first two series, with a good start to the third recently.[/quote]
