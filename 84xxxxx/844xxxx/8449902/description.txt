Mystical Lighting and Ambiance 2.0 is a suite of 27 visual effects that let you stream natural light and shading, create shadows and generate atmospheric conditions such as rain, snow, fog, smoke and haze.
With Mystical Lighting and Ambiance it's easy to add effects like rain, sleet, snow, mist, fog and haze. Combine different atmospheric conditions like snow and mist then brush-on / brush-off what you don't want. These effects are super-realistic!
Mystical Lighting and Ambiance is tightly integrated with Adobe Photoshop and works as a plug-in filter accessible under the filters menu in Photoshop.
