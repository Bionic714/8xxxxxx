Our next FCUP was written and illustrated by Wendy Pini! 'Elfquest', you ask? Sorry, no, First Comics never handled that series. What they did instead was to hire Mrs. Pini to do two one-shots of 'Beauty and the Beast', based upon the 1980s TV series that starred Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton. So you'll download it and like it, young man!


Each of my First Comics uploads contains a .txt file called 'First Missing'. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!

Praise to the praiseworthy! Get it, seed it!
