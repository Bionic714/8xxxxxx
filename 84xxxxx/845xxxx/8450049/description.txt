'Alter Ego' is our next FCUP series. (PLEASE NOTE THIS IS NOT THE FANZINE!!!!) 

Since Wikipedia is silent on the subject, allow me to recap:

Rob Lindsay, an average teen-ager, stumbles upon what appears to be an old comic premium: the mask of the Golden Age hero Alter Ego. When Rob dons the mask, he is trasported into a comic world and becomes Alter Ego, leading the "Limbo Legion" into battle against the Crimson Claw. The Claw has designs on conquering both the comic book world and Rob's "real" world, and he'll stop at nothing to do it.

This is a four-issue mini-series co-written by Roy and Dann Thomas, and illustrated by Ron Harris. This torrent contains the original mini AND the collected edition released by Heroic Publishing.
