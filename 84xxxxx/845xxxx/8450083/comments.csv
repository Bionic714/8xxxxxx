""AutoKMS: AutoKMS is a scheduled task that will renew your 180 day KMS activation. Unlike other KMS activators, AutoKMS does not run 24/7 or only at the last minute with the hope it won't fail, and leaves no traces of itself other than a scheduled task, log, and exe file. It only attempts to activate KMS licenses (which saves a lot of time if you have non-KMS licenses such as MAK or Retail active). It will run at startup and then every 24 hours and attempt KMS activation a set amount of times (the task schedule cannot be changed). The Install/Uninstall buttons are used to install or remove AutoKMS.""
