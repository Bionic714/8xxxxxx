When a mysterious, beautiful woman named Katie (Julianne Hough), moves to Southport, North Carolina, she sparks the interest of the locals, especially Alex (Josh Duhamel), a handsome widower. Although she is attracted to Alex, Katie is reluctant to trust him - that is, until a new friend (Cobie Smulders) convinces her to give Alex a chance. But before long, a dark secret from Katie's past threatens her happiness.
