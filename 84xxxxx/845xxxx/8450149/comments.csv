,TiNYBOii,2013-05-14T14:03Z,"my PC removes the Patch.exe as soon as its finished downloading because it says it is a Trojan, is this an actual Trojan or is my Anti-Virus just been silly?"
,RayDick,2013-05-19T19:51Z,"There's no Trojan, your antivirus just sees the crack as a virus, similar to many other cracks.

Everything works great, thank you uploader.

One question I have though is how can you authorize Max for Live? After following the instructions and installing Max, its just a 30 day demo. Anyone know how to authorize it?"
