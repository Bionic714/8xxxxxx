Flip Flippen is the most influential man you"ve never heard of. His philosophy has touched the lives of some of the most powerful individuals in the country, from Wall Street leaders to such sports luminaries as Terry Bradshaw. Flippen"s approach is simple. When we learn how to identify our "personal constraints" and take the steps to correct self-limiting behaviors, we will experience a surge in productivity, achieve things we have only dreamed of, and find greater happiness. Flippen has created a simple process to help listeners find their greatest limitation and then to "flip" that weakness into a newfound strength.
