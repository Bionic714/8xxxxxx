A campaign to prepare Americans for their futures
Transform Tomorrow investigates why so many Americans are at risk of out-living their savings. Author Stig Nybo draws inspiration from successful behavior change campaigns to identify the drivers of changeΓÇöcontext and beliefsΓÇöand how they can be successfully employed to boost retirement savings rates. While the retirement savings industry increasingly embraces the contextual drivers of behavior, very little is being done to shape our beliefs to start saving smarter and sooner. Nybo suggests a retirement readiness campaign to inspire and enlist the support of individuals, employers, industry, government, and the media.
* Explains how society can transition from treating 401(k) as a voluntary benefit to the basis upon which each individual who wants to or needs to can retire comfortably.
* Details a national, coordinated retirement readiness campaign, along the lines of successful Public Service AdvertisementsΓÇölike "The Crying Indian" and Rosie the RiveterΓÇöthat will help change behavior and re-shape the culture of our nation
* Makes a call to action for such a campaign

Retirement in America is endangered, but Transform Tomorrow shows a path back from the brink.
