But unfortunately I get problem when I would like to make geometry with the workbench.
The program always stated ""ansysWBU.exe encountered a problem"" and keep telling that .NET Framework is not installed altough I had installed version 4.0 of the framework.
Do you know how to fix this issue? I need to develop a model with ansys fluent."
