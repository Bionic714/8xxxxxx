One of the defining documentaries of the 20th century, The Atomic Café offers a darkly humorous and disturbing glimpse into mid-century America, an era rife with ignorance.

Narrated through an astonishing array of vintage clips and music - from military training films to campy advertisements, presidential speeches to pop songs - the film revolves around the threat - and thrill - of the newly minted atomic bomb. Taking aim at the propaganda and false optimism of the 1950s, the film's satire shines most vividly. 

Today we are just as ignorant, and most have no clue about the use 'depleted' uranium munitions, and how the radioactive micronized dust lingers for billions of years.

The Japanese were already defeated, and were attempting to surrender at the time of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. This genocidal test was meant to send a message to the Soviets, in the same way the massive firebombing of the pristine city of Dresden in Saxony, by thousands of bombers, was executed in cold blood.

From April 1945, five million Germans were rounded up after surrendering, and deliberately starved until well over one million had died, in French and American run concentration camps, an event soon erased from the history books.

Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Dresden, Eisenhower's death camps -- all holocausts.

The Allies were at least partially at fault for the deaths in German work-camps.
