away and attacked by different monstrosities, e.g. rat monsters, shambling 
zombies, three-legged robo-drones and skeletal gladiators named 
Nyarlathotep. As one character puts it, ΓÇ£EverythingΓÇÖs bigger and scarier in

mysterious physics professor, Nancy soon uncovers why. Turns out her dream 
home is more of a nightmare!
