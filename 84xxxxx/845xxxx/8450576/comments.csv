I'm assuming with the absence of any Russian, that this is indeed the better US release  : )

Thanks kindly!"
,evilmonkey99,2013-05-16T03:59Z,"PLEASE HELP. I finished downloading this and in the STREAM folder, there is no one single file that is the entire movie like many other downloads from TPB. I went ahead and tried playing it on VLC, Media Player Classic - Home Cinema and CyberLink PowerDVD 11, and none of these players work. The movie plays on all of them for awhile but then I get a copywrite error saying, 
""Dear Customer, The disc you've inserted cannot be played due to copyright restrictions. Please visit http://www.lionsgateshop.com, a local retail, or online store of choice to purchase a genuine copy.

,evilmonkey99,2013-05-16T04:01Z,please help.... I have a lot of experience working with these videos but don't know how to get around this one..... I'd hate to have to delete this. it took days to download.
,TheLathe,2013-05-16T04:26Z,"Yeah, I tried to play it on VLC, but after going through like a MILLION little clips and previews it ended on the title menu, but it didn't have any 'Play' buttons, etc.

What I normally do is burn these to Blu-ray if I think that I will like and want to keep the movie.  If you are gonna go to all the trouble to download the complete BR like this, then you should probably be prepared to do that.  Otherwise, just download either the BD5 or BD9 of the film of which there are a LOT.

The only suggestion I can give you that I would know about (as a matter of fact I'm doing it right now  : ) is I am using BDRebuilder to load the BMDV folder; it then loads the full BR and then you have a choice whether to compress just the movie only or the whole BR.  You also choose whether you wanna burn it ultimately to a full BR or whether you want to shrink it down to a DVD size (BD5) or a Dual Layer DVD size (BD9)

Since the reviews I read say that the PQ and sound are frigg'n awesome, I planned on burning the whole BR to a 25 Gig disc.  It probably will take  around 4 hours or so to do this.

Like I say, I don't see why you bothered to download the whole 45 Gig BR if all you are gonna do is watch it.  If that is all you care about then I would suggest you just download either the 4.3 - 7.95 Gig versions of it as an MKV.  There are a crapload of them here  : )

I hope that helps!

Cheers!"
,TheLathe,2013-05-16T07:38Z,"Nope, that didn't work either...

What it LOOKS like I think is some kind of new copy protection protocol where the film is divided up into a whole bunch of little m2ts pieces.   I just ran it through BDRebuilder which ALWAYS works, and it came out with the movie all jumbled up in little parts out of order.

If any of the 30 seeders here ACTUALLY have burned this (or heck even were able to WATCH the bloody thing) PLEASE leave a comment here stating what you used.

I'm sure it's NOT BOZX's fault; I really think that it is some new copy protection strategy specifically to screw up when we try to use these well known tools.  I guess I'll just hafta do what I suggested to you and snag one of the other encoded posts.

Thanks anyway mate! "
,brbear,2013-05-19T17:03Z,"@TheLathe:

What are you blathering on about?  I burned this image just fine and watched it through.  

Sony BD player, nothing hacked, nothing special.  No re-processing required.

There's nothing wrong with this image in the least.  Just a perfect BD replica.

PS: If you're concerned about if you want to burn it permanently or not, pick up some BD-RE's burn, erase, repeat.   If you want to keep it, then burn it to a BD-R."
,brbear,2013-05-19T17:39Z,"...and at your request:

SOFTWARE: I used ImgBurn to burn this image exactly as I downloaded it.  I didn't reprocess it in the least.  Heck, I didn't even move it from it's download location.

HARDWARE: Off-the-shelf retail LG Blu-ray burner I've had for over a year now.

MEDIA:  Verbatim 50gb Dual Layer BD-RE disc - I don't care to burn this permanently.  The movie was OK, but not a keeper for me.   But I suspect if I were to burn it to a BD-R, I'd have the same results."
,TheLathe,2013-05-19T19:53Z,"Wow, I'll be damned...

Well, I appreciate you taking the time to leave a comment here saying that it was fine for you.  I guess when I tried to play the folder with VLC and then after running it through BDRebuilder (to shrink it to a 25 Gig BD-R) and VLC played that folder all weird, I certainly didn't go and burn it.

Maybe I just overthought it then. EXCELLENT suggestion about using the BD-RE though; I just never bothered with it.  But since I DO like to watch the disc through my system, that would be a perfect way to do it.  Why didn't I think of that?!  : )

Yeah, I pretty much use the same soft and hardware you do, so I think I'd better snag a couple of BD-REs!

Thanks mate!!!"
