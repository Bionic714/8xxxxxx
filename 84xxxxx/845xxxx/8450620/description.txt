All Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

With only a handful of exceptions, every song on Sony Music Special Products' Rock Classics of the '60s actually is considered a rock classic, at least if the playlists of oldies radio stations are any indication. Only the Electric Flag's "Groovin' Is Easy," the Rip Chords' "Hey Little Cobra" and Al Kooper's take on "The Weight" aren't regularly heard on the radio. The rest -- "Time Has Come Today," "Down in the Boondocks," "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy," "Kicks," "Rainy Day Women #12 & 35," "Spinning Wheel," "Evil Ways," "Piece of My Heart," "So You Want to Be a Rock & Roll Star" -- are all in heavy rotation, which is what makes this a good choice for oldies fans who want a hard copy of these tunes.
