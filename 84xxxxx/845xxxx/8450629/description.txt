All Music Album Review (by Steve Leggett):

This three-disc set (it could easily have been a double-disc collection with some shifting of tracks) ranges widely across the AM pop genres of the 1960s, and includes such varied tracks as Ray Peterson's "Tell Laura I Love Her," Skeeter Davis' "The End of the World," Ronny & the Daytonas' "GTO," the Lovin' Spoonful's "Summer in the City," and the Box Tops' "The Letter." While it certainly isn't exhaustive, it does feature the original single mixes of these hits, and makes for a fine road trip down memory lane.
