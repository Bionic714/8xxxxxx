All Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

Son of Frat Rock continues the pattern of its father, Frat Rock, by providing 18 infectious, danceable rock & roll and R&B oldies. There are a couple of big names here -- the Kinks ("You Really Got Me"), Tommy James ("Mony Mony"), Mitch Ryder ("Devil With a Blue Dress"), Ritchie Valens ("La Bamba"), Bobby Fuller ("I Fought the Law") -- but the main attraction of the disc is that it collects one-hit wonders like "Little Bit O' Soul," "Farmer John," "Cool Jerk," "Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)," "If You Wanna Be Happy," "Peanut Butter," "Bottle of Wine," "California Sun," "Quarter to Three" and "Hot Pastrami." There's no better place to get these classic rock & roll singles -- which are some of the greatest rock & roll ever recorded -- in one place than Son of Frat Rock, no matter how silly the title and the packaging may be, and that's why it's essential.
