Heathers is a 1988 black comedy-coming of age film starring Winona Ryder and Christian Slater. The film portrays four girls — three of whom are named Heather — in a clique at a fictional Ohio high school.[1]

The film brought director Michael Lehmann and producer Denise Di Novi the 1990 Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. Daniel Waters also gained recognition for his screenplay, which won a 1990 Edgar Award.[2] The film was a U.S. box office failure,[3] but went on to become a cult classic, with high rentals and sales business. In 2006, it was ranked #5 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the "50 Best High School Movies"[4] and in 2008, it was ranked #412 on Empire's list of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time".[5]
