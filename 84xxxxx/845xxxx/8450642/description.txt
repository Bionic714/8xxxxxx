All Music Album Review (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine):

Spring Break is a hodgepodge of British Invasion, pop-rock, garage rock and soul from the '60s. All ten tracks are very familiar -- "Gimme Some Lovin'," "Do Wah Diddy Diddy, " "Don't Worry Baby, " "Hippy Hippy Shake, " "Psychotic Reaction, " "Nobody But Me, " "Come a Little Bit Closer" -- and while this is hardly a definitive collection, it's a fun party record.
