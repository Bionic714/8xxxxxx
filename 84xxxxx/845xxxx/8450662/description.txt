Players face off across a ice rink, in a hockey duel ΓÇô one player and one keeper one each side. Play is rapid and rough, with players spending as much time eating the ice as on their feet. There are three different single player modes (Tournament, Quick Match and Deathmatch) and a single-device multiplayer.
