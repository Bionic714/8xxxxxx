,Maxbanan,2013-05-08T06:54Z,"The audio is totaly fuckt up, donw download this shiet"
,sherlyhiddles,2013-05-08T06:57Z,"if you download this, you're gonna have a bad time. The audio is INCREDIBLY out of sync, to the point where it's unwatchable. I'd find another torrent, if I were you."
,esdii,2013-05-08T07:07Z,-25 seconds to sync sound & video...
,copyleftpirate,2013-05-08T07:28Z,"Use J on VLC to move the audio to -25,100 and it should be fine.  Thanks key52 for the advice.  "
,NosTraDomus,2013-05-08T07:29Z,"yea, it works but you must sync it yourself.

open VLC

goto TOOLS then track sync

then video/audio copy and paste -25.100
top right  it has a refresh button, click it and close

then press play again, if it wont play, skip ahead a few minutes, then it should play, then skip back to beginning..

alot of work i know... but simple

or download another version."
