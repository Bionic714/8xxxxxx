A collection of fan-made animations of missing Doctor Who episodes, as well as several animated Doctor Who audio plays. Quality varies considerably from episode to episode - most of these have been downloaded from YouTube and then edited together. I've also included a couple of animated reconstructions (the ones where telesnaps are animated to move and talk). None of the animated episodes released on official DVDs have been included.
