Microsoft Visual C# 2010: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

(this is a pdf file)

I'm sick and tired of textbook publishers overcharging for educational materials. I came across this pdf some time ago and wanted to share this since it seems to be unavailable anywhere.

Please enjoy and spread the word.
