"Deep below the city of Los Angeles, pressure from the Earth's mantle has created an intricate network of underground faults. Scientists have made significant progress in identifying these faults and in measuring and locating earthquakes in the area, but new faults continue to appear. The recent quake that struck the Northridge area in January 1994 exposed a previously unknown fault line, and proved once again that earthquakes are nearly impossible to predict with any precision. Nonetheless, many experts believe that a serious earthquake will strike the Los Angeles area in the near future. This episode of NOVA explores the effects of the Northridge quake and raises questions about predicting and preparing for 'The Big One.'"
