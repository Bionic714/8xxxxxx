[V],promodsharma,2013-05-23T20:19Z,"@ 'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55)- Welcome back my friend ! I think you are suffering from illusions, What say ? You next remark please ?"
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-23T20:27Z,@ 'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55)- Suggest you consult a Psychiatrist.
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-23T20:29Z,"@ 'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55)- I am serious, because all that ranting, raving, foaming in the mouth etc. are classical symptoms of an impending nervous breakdown. Please take of your health, or else the TPB would be a dull place without people like you around to provide entertainment."
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-24T09:35Z,"@ 'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55)- See ? Compulsive Ranting and Raving again. I am sure that this is not your true nature. You Rant and Rave rather impulsively. It's not within your control. As your well wisher I reiterate my previous advise to you , Please, Please see a Psychiatrist at your earliest. If not for your sake at least for the sake of your family. Please report back to me after you have done so."
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-26T16:50Z,"'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55) [Recently- Self Appointed Representative of the TPB Community]  Dera ! Dear !! I am getting more and more worried. Now you are also getting Schizophrenic, all more reason to see a Psychiatric ! I pray for you, may God have mercy on you and cure you soon. My heart goes out to your family."
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-27T05:09Z,'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55)' - Congrats !  I notice you have stopped using your traditional war cry 'muahahahaha...!!!!!!' which does show that you are trying to control yourself. Keep it up. I sincerely pray you come out of the delusion. I am also happy to note that your family supports you. Family support is very important for you to be cured. I would again advise you to consult a Psychiatrist. Please let me know your progress with the Psychiatrist. Convey my sympathies to your family. What did they do to deserve a person like you ?
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-27T18:50Z,'muahahahaha...' (aka - seppmoser55)' - Go home to your mother.

Good Luck with your future endeavors in life."

Either way, keep on posting sir, as I'm looking forward to seeing all 35 volumes of your collection. Just wish they were being posted a bit faster, but that's me being impatient :)"
