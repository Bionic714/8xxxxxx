,Kona_Guy,2013-05-13T02:19Z,"NOT BLURAY, THIS IS COMPRESSED SHIT. STILL OK QUALITY BUT NOT BLURAY! WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NAME YOUR TORRENTS BLURAY ASSHOLE?"
,masterpa,2013-05-13T20:49Z,"Thanks again for great up, YIFY "
,caphorn,2013-05-13T21:10Z,"great quality for a small size
a9 v10

thank you again YIFI you're the best"
,battlefielder40,2013-05-15T03:48Z,"Im with Kona Guy kinda, this is not what we would call a bluray. We need to maybe get a new sub cat that we can put these ""BrRips"" at so they dont get mixed in with the actual BluRay Rips that we're used to."
,crazyoliv,2013-05-15T08:43Z,"Video qwality is very great. Sound Qwality is very bad. Not because of compression but because it comes from a Bluray, which is originaly engineered for specific sound protocol (5.1, THX whatsoever). The result is that it waste all the movie if you are watching it on a low qwality home cinema (laptop, usual TV). It's complete nonesense.

The yifY team knows about picture compression, but gets completely deaf, and it gets worser every month.

Why using Bluray as the original support for a 800Mo rip. It's a beginner mistake! DVD instead would have been a much more reasonable choice due to the compression loss. The results looks the same without the side effects (qwadriphonie, 720p, useless stuff that do not witness of the picture/sound qwality at all where they just notify the protocol)

You brainless guy might know that window-icon could exist in 720p. It doesn't change nothing in its appearance. But it dramaticaly increase the processor activity for an insignificant improvements. 720p, 1080p thats like your shoe-size made a marketing brand. who cares? you?

Since they expanded their web-activity, the Yify team's strategy to conquere the web is gone... pretty mad, wheareas it began increadibly seducing (I was the first addict in here).
At least Axxo was perfectly consistent from begining to end. Which is hell of a brand."
,andyfukinj,2013-05-16T02:08Z,"@ crazyoliv...
As if anyone would listen to a retard who uses a word like ""worser"" ?

you jealous haters can all kiss my ass. If you don't like YIFY, why do bother downloading their movies? Or do you just come on here and talk shit? "
,mr_brand,2013-05-16T17:51Z,Thank you so much mate!
,xBobbyx,2013-05-16T20:22Z,A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD AND WARM BODIES PLEASE!!!!! Yify your the MAN!!!
,yadam2001,2013-05-17T22:28Z,hey caphorn u give for video 10 of 10? are u stupid?
,pirutluva,2013-05-17T22:48Z,@crazyoliv You Dumb Ass Troll STFU!!!! Look @ Top 100 And Tell Me What You See? What I See Is A Whole Bunch Of Jealous Fkrs Crying Because YIFY (IS THE Top 100) And No One Downloads The Crying Little Nub Trolls Wack Ass Downloads. 
,myoPNESS,2013-05-18T19:24Z,"@crazyoliv...nobody told you to download the shit...also nobody asked for a fucking essay (with a F grade for spelling and grammar) about YIFY's uploads...if you want people to listen and maybe even in the tiniest amount take you seriously....learn how to spell incredibly, conquer, and how to use proper grammer when something is worse than worse....its EVEN worse fucktard.....people who think people care about them....ugh "
,alrightbob,2013-05-20T01:24Z,"A/10 V/10 M/10.

A great movie and to the less anally retarded eye for details I would have to say there was no problem watching it.
Thanks YIFY for the dl"
,AlfreedoS,2013-05-20T01:24Z,"downloading, thanks in advance (:"
,cajunTroy504,2013-05-23T00:57Z,"A = 9
V = 9
M = 7.28

Thanks again YIFY team ....y'all fuckin rock!!"
,olaflsenc,2013-05-25T08:17Z,"Thanks for the upload, but why do you insist of compressing the hell out of the audio? It sounds pretty bad when it's not at least 128kbps. Please stop doing this. V9/A6"
,zikkoo05,2013-05-26T02:16Z,very nice ^^
,ProphetZarquon,2013-05-28T04:22Z,"Agreed I miss aXXo (though I don't miss DivX):

YIFY makes quality torrents to be sure, and very well seeded because they are well known.

The image quality really has been turned down significantly lately.

720p is not worth the resolution at this size. If you want a nice 720p picture, go with something about 1.6 to 2.4gb in size.
For 811mb you might as well be watching a DVD rip.
(And yes, if the file's this small, it's probably mostly people with smaller setups downloading it, so 160 or 192kbps 2ch stereo would be nice)

Bottom line: YIFY 800mb rips are great for watching on a small screen, but I'd look elsewhere for collection-quality BrRips these days. YIFY seems to now put small-size over quality."
,Hevener,2013-06-05T05:54Z,"A - 8
V - 9
M - 8 - Caught me off guard that it would be so good. Good twists, well acted.

One of those not-so-well known movies that turns out to be quite good."
,bigtexxx,2013-06-06T05:37Z,@olaflsenc Shut the fuck up and just watch...you don't like..buy the fuckin thing!
,Gargamel77,2013-06-07T17:36Z,TY Yify team!
