,EnKay909,2013-05-13T15:53Z,"Microsoft Security Essentials Quarantined The Keygen so i cancelled the download , i download and install lots of torrents , very rare that MSE flags anything , had the 64 bit version installed no bother might have to go back to that one , thanks for your efforts Ching Liu "
,wutwat,2013-05-13T17:05Z,"@EnKay909 - new to computers huh? there's wut is called a 'false positive', and worthless microsoft security essentials is good at doing that. if ching_liu is seeding an [ I/O ] release you can gosh darn guarantee it's legit."
,EnKay909,2013-05-14T00:17Z,"@wutwat , not at all as said i download and install torrents all the time , MSE is not worthless its the best free internet security i have used , i am not stupid , i know what false positives are i have read enough comments on here over the last 5 years to know that , was still enough to make me cancel the download and revert back to the 64 bit version i had running previous .. cheers"
,wutwat,2013-05-27T02:29Z,"@EnKay909: sure, i see your point. i guess you could run it in a sandboxed enviroment or ask someone else patch the .exe for you? in this situation it's definitely one of those things where you might have to take a little risk to get the reward i guess - :)"
