I know you will when you have time and apoligze ahead of time if i hurt your feelings. I defiantly didn't mean to. I appreciate so much you doing these my wife loves her soaps and can now watch them again well having her cancer treatments. 
thanks so much again for doing this for us. my wife and i appreciate it a lot."
,mickedee77,2013-05-08T13:33Z,"Hi disneydreams, I have got uTorrent open, so all files should be seeding, however due to the amount of files I have uploaded recently, it may not have been working properly on all files. I have shut down the episodes from last week and I hope that is enough to make it work for this weeks episodes. Let me know if there is any more problems :)"

I am seeding last weeks OLTL, and AMC i didnt get the others but that is ok she likes those two the best.
