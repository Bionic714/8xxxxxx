,truthseekers666,2013-05-21T12:35Z,This is awful. The cracker has skinned this app as piaret icons and silly pirate slang to describe the functions of the program Also it makes LOUD yo ho ho sounds every time it checks for mail and if you try to turn this function off it takes you to the makers website... to be avoided.... Also there are a few copies like this out there. So good uck fidning some that arent buggered about with like this piece of crap.
