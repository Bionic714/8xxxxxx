Katawa Shoujo (πüïπüƒπéÅσ░æσÑ│ Katawa Sh┼ìjo?, lit. "Cripple Girls", translated "Disability Girls") is a bish┼ìjo-style visual novel by Four Leaf Studios that tells a story of a young man and five young women living with varying disabilities. The game uses a traditional text and sprite-based visual novel model with an ADV-style text box running on the Ren'Py visual novel engine.

The majority of the story takes place at the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located in an unnamed city somewhere in modern, northern Japan.[3] Hisao Nakai, a normal boy, has his life changed when a long-dormant cardiac dysrhythmia forces him to transfer to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao has the opportunity to find friends and love.

The gameplay of Katawa Shoujo is choice-based, with the player reading through text and occasionally making decisions that instantiate the possible events or dialogue within the story. Depending on the choices made by the player, the story branches into multiple forks variously chronicling Hisao's deepening and eventually romantic relationship with one of the five main female characters (or lack thereof), some of which may variously end well, badly, neutrally (or bitter-sweetly), or even with Hisao abruptly dying if he doesn't pursue any relationships whatsoever.[4]
