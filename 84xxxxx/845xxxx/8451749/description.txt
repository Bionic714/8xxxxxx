Popular casebook author Freer makes the complex principles of civil procedure accessible and fun for students in this student treatise. Using humor, real-world examples and light-hearted scholarship, he breaks down the doctrines of civil procedure into easy-to-understand components, and then brings them together to show how they form a comprehensive body of law.
