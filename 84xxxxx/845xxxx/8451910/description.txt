Cloud Atlas is a 2012 German[8] drama and science fiction film[9] written, produced and directed by Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer. Adapted from the 2004 novel by David Mitchell, the film features multiple plotlines set across six different eras. The official synopsis for Cloud Atlas describes the film as: "An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution."[10]

During four years of development the project met difficulties securing financial support; it was eventually produced with a $102 million budget provided by independent sources, making Cloud Atlas one of the most expensive independent films of all time. Production began in September 2011 at Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam-Babelsberg, Germany.

The film premiered on 9 September 2012 at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival[11] and was released on 26 October 2012 in conventional and IMAX cinemas.[12]

Cloud Atlas polarized critics, and has subsequently been included on various Best Film and Worst Film lists.[13][14][15] The film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for Tykwer (who co-scored the film), Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil
