Here's the original MTD V0 Scene release.

"ItΓÇÖs the day 98 Degrees fans have been waiting for: The bandΓÇÖs first new album in more than a decade, 2.0, hit stores Tuesday (May 7). Jeff Timmons added that, despite their updated sound, the guys havenΓÇÖt changed much since their 1.0 days. ΓÇ£WeΓÇÖre the same guys. WeΓÇÖre entertainers, singers, trying to evolve musically. Same guys, just a different era and, you know, trying to come up with new, cool stuff,ΓÇ¥ he said.
Some of that new, cool stuff includes their unexpectedly cheeky single ΓÇ£Microphone,ΓÇ¥ as well as working with a new pack of hitmakers like Ne-Yo and Bruno Mars to add some new-millennium sparkle to their signature sound."
