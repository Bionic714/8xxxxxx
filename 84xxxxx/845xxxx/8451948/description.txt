Hi,

The six playlists from the MAD (Music Against Depression) project. Sometimes I am down as well. Started to make a list of all unused tracks that lifted me up. Ended up with 6 lists, each containing sixteen songs. Especially suited for depressed people reading a book. After hearing them all, your depression is gone.... Enjoy,
