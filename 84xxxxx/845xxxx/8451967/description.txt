The film begins by employing a hand-held style as the main protagonists. Following a photo montage of the couple - Koldo and Clara, are about to celebrate their wedding day. The wedding is primarily filmed by Koldo's cousin, Adrián, and their wedding photographer, Atun, plus footage cuts in from other guests' cell phones and cameras. All goes well and the guests travel to the wedding reception, held in a huge mansion, on chartered buses. Guests mingle whilst Adrián films his uncle, who says he was bitten by a dog, but claims he will be alright.
