The long awaited return of SHRUGGED continues! You think you're prepared, but you're not. You've been decisive in your actions up to this point, but now things have been turned upside down. You feel you've conformed your mindset and are ready to accept what you're about to experience, but you haven't. That's because SHRUGGED is back and ready to blow your mind! An evil unlike any other has made its way back to Perspecta and he's going to teach everyone there the true meaning of the word fear. Meanwhile, Theo's troubles have only just begun as his new teacher isn't quite what he seems and the recent arrival of Lou, the pretty girl on Theo's track team, has the What If Mafia on overdrive. How can Ange hope to keep Theo's focus on graduating, and how is it that Dev is screwing things up worse??

Thanks goes to Tarutaru and Mediozo for this release.
