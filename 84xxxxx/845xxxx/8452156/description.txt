Sara Pezzini is no longer in the dark. She remembers her life the way it used to be, the family she used to have. A mother without a daughter, Sara also feels the full guilt for her actions committed during a different life. All she wants to do is hole up and grieve. But her investigation into the Chicago underbelly is catching up to her, and it's not concerned with the personal time she wants to take for herself.
