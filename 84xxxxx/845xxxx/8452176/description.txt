SHOWDOWN WITH THE WITCHBLADE OF THE WILD WEST! In the days of the Wild West, before Sara Pezzini claimed her destiny, Witchblade bearer Sheriff Enola protected the high plains from the Darkness that lurked beyond the horizon. Although her townspeople lived in peace, they were always mistrusting of their sheriff-witch. With her town seeking to banish her and the Darkness angling for a duel, will the Witchblade be enough to save Enola from becoming a footnote in the annals of the blade's history?
