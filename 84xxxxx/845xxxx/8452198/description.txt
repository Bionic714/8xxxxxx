The Nine Lives of Catseye Gomez

Simon Hawke

Catseye, P.I. Name's Gomez. I'm a cat. But in an age of magic, nothing's quite what it seems. Predators and crooks take a hundred new forms...so do the heroes.
It was a new town, new turf for an old stray tom. I came to Denver looking for a fresh start, but what I found was criminal: Susan Jacobs, a beautiful, ambitious young broadcaster meeting a car bomb that blew more then her ratings sky high. I needed this case like I needed a hairball, but Jacob's sexy calico, a purrfect kitty with lambent golden eyes, needed ME. So, with a Zippo-snapping, studded leather rebel cop named Leventhal, I'm prowling among political wackos, religious nuts, media weasels, talking snakes, gutter sorcerers, wannabe wizards...on a cat-and-mouse hunt for a killer. And when I find who it is, the fur's gonna fly.

I reformatted the PDF workerbee found, split it into chapters, made a chapter menu and cleaned the spacings/indents.
