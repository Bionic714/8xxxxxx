This is the first time I've uploaded a torrent, and my wife just told me that she is having problems viewing this on her nook. I know the .pdf file will work on the computer, but I'm not sure about the other ones. I don't want to mislead anyone and if the other files aren't working I need to delete this torrent. Also, I apologize for the double files (again, this is my first upload)."
,hellomrsg,2013-05-09T00:59Z,@KillaWraith- No issue viewing on my nook as an epub. 
,trey_dogg3,2013-05-09T01:03Z,Works on iPad and Kindle. Thanks alot
,terribletext,2013-05-09T01:12Z,Tried it with my nook and it didn't work for me either but having the pdf is good enough for me. Thanks so much for uploading this! 
,krazydaze,2013-05-09T01:16Z,"KillaWraith,  Just finished installing.  I used the Epub format.  You had duplicates of each file included in your torrent.  The one in the FOLDER did NOT work.  The individual Epub file worked fine.  "
,KillaWraith,2013-05-09T03:05Z,"Thanks everyone for the feedback and support. We're still having problems opening up the Epub file, but I'm sure we'll figure it out."
,silverpepsiguy,2013-05-09T07:45Z,"Cool, now what about the audio book? I love the audio book ! "
,Marci2760,2013-05-10T02:02Z,"If you want an e-book file to work you can download Calibre, and convert the files. It has an extremely easy user interface and best of all it's free!

This is awesome thank you soooooo much!!!"
,Tabbycat7319,2013-05-10T07:42Z,Works just fine on my kobo. I used the epub file in the first part of the download not the one in the folder.
,hillsyheart,2013-05-11T18:32Z,"I've never had problems with an ebook, but I absolutely can't get this to work.  I use calibre regularly to put files on my kindle, but these files won't open and can't be converted for some reason."
,Yakfu26,2013-05-13T09:14Z,"silverpepsiguy heres the audio book...
