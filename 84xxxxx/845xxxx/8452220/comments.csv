:) :) :) :)

Good find, BTW, my friend. You've really become a hero to a lot of us who love those Golden Age stories. You're doing such a great job that I almost hesitate to make requests, lest it interupt your flow of bringing the forgotten ones back to the light.

However, if you *do* get a dry spell, no ultra rush or anything like that, but if you've got a Newsboy Legion or Boy Commandos archive sitting there collecting platter powder...

,ChingaTuu,2013-05-08T18:22Z,"....Ah! Wasn't aware of that criteria. Both of those were Golden Age Kirby & Simon ""Kid Gang"" series done for DC. The Newsboys were in ""Star Spangled Comics"", while the Commandos were in their own title as well as in ""Detective"".

ANyhoo, if you can't dig these up, no prob. I've got the 'tec issues from that big archive of ""Detective"" that got posted right after DC screwed the pooch and rebooted everything with that bullshit ""DCnU52"" stunt, so I'll just quit being lazy and filter through those once I've finished perusing through these classic gems you're currently posting.

...Seriously, Mothra, you're doing all of us a great service by posting these. I'm trying to keep them seeded from my end for at least 48-72 hours after they've finished being leeched to help you out. Today's generation needs to read and appreciate these, because the Golden Age stories just had the basics about them that today's comics just can't match.

Again, well done. And I think I speak for STFM as well on this one :) :)"
