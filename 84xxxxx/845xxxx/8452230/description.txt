THIS TORRENT IS YET ANOTHER FIX FOR "Might and Magic Heroes VI Gold Edition RePack-Catalyst"

it is the final fix and confirmed working on a different machine



***** PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT YET IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO LEECH AND RUN, DUE TO THE SIZE AND MY LIMITED BANDWIDTH I WILL ONLY UPLOAD UNTIL THERE IS 2 OTHER SEEDERS

I WILL RESEED ON REQUEST IF NEEDED


it fixes the "The specified file contains invalid data" error i was getting after applying the patched dll files for SoD

sorry for the large size but there was nothing i could do about that
the dumbass that did the repack also repacked the *.orc files and that is why i was getting the invalid data error

talk about frustrating ...

anyway, download this torrent and extract directly into your game install folder and you will have Shades of Darkness installed

be sure to read the install.nfo file and follow instructions

if you got as far as i did and got SoD installed but got the error i did then the only file you need is DATAxx.rar

The 'repack' by catalyst has Data.orc to Data 10.orc
The 'Skid Row' release has Data.orc to Data 16.orc

If you have a legit copy or the Skid Row release of Heroes VI GOLD then you only need the Heroes VI 1.8 + SoD.rar file + *.reg


best of luck
