,zturtle,2013-05-08T20:11Z,Thanks!!!! 
,sslim66,2013-05-08T20:25Z,the cover doesnt do the issue justice
,AnnaBulleta,2013-05-08T22:55Z,"it sucks that Michonne died, BTW I won't seed this torrent."
,binderguy1,2013-05-09T00:11Z,"@ STFmaryville:  thanks for the UL!

@ AnnaBulleta:  Dammit!  Did you HAVE to go and spoil it for the rest of us who haven't got the chance to read it yet!?! =:("
,buffalo25,2013-05-09T03:03Z,"Michonne does not die. Jesus, some people are just dumb. Stupid people like @AnnaBulleta just wanna make people mad. Michonne lives on!!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T03:53Z,i love these comments. you guys & gals make it all worthwhile.
,binderguy1,2013-05-09T05:25Z,"Michonne's my fav character, so whew!  For now, anyway.  I'm sure Kirkman will do away with her when he's good and ready.  ;-)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T14:38Z,"the FCBD giveaway comic made me nostalgic. i wish he'd never killed tyrese. great character ... and at the time he was killed off, one of the top 2 or 3 black heroes in comics"
,stijr,2013-05-10T10:26Z,thanks!
,mixeng,2013-05-12T04:36Z,"Does Anyone have the complete 
The Last Zombie - Dead New World"
,rhorne72,2013-05-13T23:26Z,"I can't seem to open this one. Comes up as 
""unknown file type"". I have CDisplay but this and certain others will not open. Any other comic reader programs that might work?"
,railgun1,2013-05-14T10:03Z,Thank you     !
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-14T16:02Z,"rhorne72, you should upgrade to CDisplayEx V1.9.5, free at cdisplayex.com -- it opens perfectly. other than that, ""unknown file type"" sounds like a file association error. os issue? you need someone with more tech support knowledge than me."
,atthedrivein81,2013-05-14T16:46Z,Description made me chuckle.  Thanks for the digital upload.
,rickman1,2013-05-17T00:52Z,Thank you. :)
,LastLombax,2013-05-17T15:55Z,"Nice, thanks man!!"
,pow.r.pop,2013-05-22T19:46Z,"Oh jeeze, it's like ""Life of Pi' Zombie style .

I can't wait to see that tiger eat some beloved characters face off. Because....He's a tiger and this is ridiculous"
,pow.r.pop,2013-05-24T08:00Z,I forgot to say thank you. Thanks a bunch
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-24T20:05Z,He's going to eat Rick's other hand next issue!
,s0rds,2013-05-31T02:03Z,"I think eventually Rick will die as Kirkman is said nobody is really safe and I think Carl will become a bad ass leader.  I mean look at the character development for Carl, look at what he has experienced.  Kid's firing guns at 8 years old, has been shot twice by what 11 years old.  Slowly becoming fearless.  Will have had Rick his teacher.  This is the only comic series I have read every issue and I have read each one twice now.  I haven't gotten past more than 10 issues in a row in any other series.  I'm not an avid comic reader but nothing has come close to this comic series.  "
,pow.r.pop,2013-06-01T03:28Z,"I'd like to see an invasion from a foreign country that wasn't infected ....like China or Saudi Arabia ....then the shit really hits the fan as they fight for survival against the Undead AND invaders ! But what the Invaders don't know is how formidable the undead can be. And how they too are now infected now that they are in the United States. Ricks team (Much smaller) watches a whole new breed of Zombies being introduced from all the cocky invaders. Then ......a transmission from Australia ! They have a CURE ! and the island is safe ! ....But How will they get there ? .....Turmoil on the seas ....


COME ON KIRKMAN ! I know you read this shit.....Give us something a little more than a stupid fucking tiger and another Governor. Did you just give up writing ?    "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T20:04Z,"pow.r.pop aren't you the least bit excited to see who lives or dies when this clusterfuck of a war with negan starts?

p.s. bet the tiger eats somebody good!"
,pow.r.pop,2013-06-06T22:23Z,"honestly, I think the tiger is just gonna get shot in the head"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-11T16:42Z,"""you shot my pussy!"""
,pow.r.pop,2013-06-12T07:34Z,"If everyone is infected , why can't they eat walkers ?

I would think if you BBQ them it would kill all the germs "
,pow.r.pop,2013-06-12T07:35Z,"And that meat would be tender ...Mmmmnn Hmmm , BBQ sause"
