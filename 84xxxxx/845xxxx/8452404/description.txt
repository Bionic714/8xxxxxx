RP is the quintessential good guy,   
and even if he plays the key role    
of Raavan in the popular stage play  
ΓÇÿRaavan LeelaΓÇÖ, his values echo those
of Ram. He is always ready to help   
people in need, often at the cost of 
his own comfort. One night as RP is  
on his way to meet his long term     
girlfriend Chitra, he comes across   
Mandar Lele, who is distraught and   
lonely.
