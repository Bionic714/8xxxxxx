,degu2012,2013-05-08T19:08Z,chiwetel ejiofor for john stewart and the guy who plays hobbs in bones as guy. i just want to see a green lantern with a jewfro really :)
,degu2012,2013-05-08T19:09Z,also is this set before or after green lantern #20?
,degu2012,2013-05-08T19:36Z,set after GL #20. well done DC comics for releasing what is basically a comic full of spoilers.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-08T19:53Z,"they're really a mess right now, aren't they?"
,degu2012,2013-05-08T20:12Z,its ridiculous especially with red lanterns and GL new guardians to come too before the release of GL#20. why not just delay these too?
,steve1995,2013-05-08T21:13Z,"Well, not reading this or any more Lantern comics until GL 20 comes out. Oh DC, get your act together...

Thanks for the upload anyway. "

,lordxoi,2013-05-09T04:28Z,Well that explains why it made no sense at all! Awesome!
