Plenty of old gog games has been updated to their 2.x.x.x versions + updated bonus content, you can get those on the ""Релизы с GOG"" torrent section of ""Bestrepack.net"". For most of the recent GOG games go to tehparadox ""[BU] Good Old Games - GOG Collection"" thread.

I'm not asking for them to be uploaded here, it is just in case you needed help getting them."

,hkenneth,2013-06-01T20:44Z,Is that possible to upload Grid? It is newly released on GOG.
