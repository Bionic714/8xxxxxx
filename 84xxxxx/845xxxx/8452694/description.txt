Ursa Major - Ursa Major (1972/2000)

From Michigan, a rather uninspired and pompous hard rock album with the former leader of Frost and the Amboy Dukes bassist. Wagner would later work with Lou Reed and Alice Cooper as well as releasing a solo album aptly titled Richard Wagner(Atlantic 19172) 1978. Lovers of the "other" Richard Wagner must have been surprised if they bought this album!!
