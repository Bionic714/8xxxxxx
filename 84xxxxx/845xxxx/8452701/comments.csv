THANKS FOR THE MARVELLOUS UPLOAD, BUT PLS TELL IF THIS ONE HAS THE DREAM SEQUENCE........ITS AN INTERESTING FACT THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE HU SAW THIS MOVIE IN THEATRES SAW IT COMPLETE....NO COMMERCIAL RELEASED VERSION IS COMPLETE SINCE EVERY ONE IS HAVING THE HALF-HOUR LONG DREAM SQNC AT THE END LOPPED OFF.......AND THATS THE SOUL OF THIS MOVIE, OTHERWISE IT MAKES NO SENSE. DOES THIS ONE HAS THAT SEQUENCE ? - RGDS - LOVEPAREEK. "

I downloaded only Jamababu from those 3 films as I already had other two. There is no problem with it whatsoever. The print is perfrect! 

@ zyx55e 
Can you please seed Jaya Ganga (1998) for few hours? 3-4 of us are stuck on 58.9% for a while now. I'll keep it alive for some time afterwards. And thanks for all the gems you are putting up. :)"

ON JAMAIBABU EVEN I M NOT SURE. BUT OTHER 2, I M SURE. ITS A PITY THAT U HAVE SUCH AN EXCELLENT TORRENT NAUKAR KI KAMEEZ, BUT ITS LIKE DEAD....NO SEEDERS, NO LEECHERS
