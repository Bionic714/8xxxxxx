,binderguy1,2013-05-09T05:22Z,"I wonder if people phoned in to vote Robin dead the second time around like they did with Jason Todd in the late 80's or early 90's?

Thanks for the ul, STFmaryville.

Can u reseed any of the Elektra V1, V2, Root of all Evil, and related mini-series?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T14:23Z,"i was reading my copy of hembeck archives the other day, and apparently comic buyer's guide did a phone-in vote on whether or not to kill off hembeck several years later. also resulted in a dead ""hero"", lol.

yeah sure, i'd like to have a complete elektra set myself anyway. it'll take a few days due to my work schedule."
