I tried to download Tour de Romandie from CyclingTorrent, provider you do promote. How does it works, they don't want me to create an account. Any idea why?"
,crazyoliv,2013-05-08T20:31Z,"why don't you upload Tour de Romandie and Tour of the Basque Country? Why would you not be the promoter of cycling in PTB?

Can you upload Olympics 2012 Cross Country men and women (Mountain Bike). You could make a lot of us very very happy.

Thank you in advance "

Try to contact them on their email address - it's on the front page. There might be an IRC channel as well somewhere.

The ""Tour de Romandie 2013"" is on their site."
,crazyoliv,2013-05-09T21:22Z,"Thank you very much BasilBrush for your reply.
Actually, I succeed to register @ CyclingTorrent.
EXCELLENT site. I had the Tour de romandie 2013 and the Critérium International 2013 (corsica) where Froome told JCPerraud (in a fluent french) : Ready to start / I can't, I need to cool down / You might want to start sometime... Froooome.
They also upload Cross Country Mountainbike. Very nice coverage.
Thank you BasilBrush anyway."
