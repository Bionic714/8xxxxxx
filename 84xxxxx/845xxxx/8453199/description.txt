The Official Star Wars Fact File was a series of magazines published weekly by De Agostini from 2002 to 2005, consisting of 140 issues in total. It was an archive of documents collated from all aspects of the Star Wars saga, including information from the films (excluding Revenge of the Sith), various novels, comics, video games, and the New Jedi Order. It also provided some all-new illustrations. To date, it is the most comprehensive published record of the Star Wars galaxy in existence.
It was only published in Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Germany (120 issues + index), France (as Star Wars "Les Dossiers Officiels"), Malta, and MÃ©xico. It was later published in Argentina, however, only the first issue reached the stores.

In Japan, the magazine had additional articles (produced by writers in the UK and US) but a shorter run. The extra articles were added to the UK and Dutch edition of the magazine, extending the run at that point from 120 issues to the final 140. An index containing a list of all articles was also published.

The original concept work was conducted by Marcus Hearn, former editor of Titan's Official Star Wars Magazine, and Andrew Kemp. Many of the writers on the project had also been involved with Titan's licensed magazine. The Fact File was put together for De Agostini by Warrender Grant, based in London.
