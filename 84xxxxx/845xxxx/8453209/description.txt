Whether or not you're a die-hard fan of the group, you'll love this detailed "rockumentary" of England's legendary Spinal Tap. Acclaimed commercial director, Marty DiBergi(Rob Reiner) takes you behind-the-scenes for an intimate look at a band whose time has come...and gone...and come again...and... Through interviews, rare footage and lots of music - including classic Tap tunes like "Big Bottom" and "Hell Hole" - you'll get acquainted with David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) and every drummer who ever lived - and died - for this renowned rock band.
