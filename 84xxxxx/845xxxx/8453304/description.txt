How I installed it:
** Remember: Your device must be capable of 720p video decoding and rooted, unless YouTube is not preinstalled as a system app!

ΓÇó Removed /system/app/YouTube.apk
ΓÇó If YouTube is still in the app drawer, go into YouTube app info and tap ΓÇ£Remove installed updatesΓÇ¥, then ΓÇ£Force stopΓÇ¥.
ΓÇó Install my APK!

If that doesnΓÇÖt work for you, try this alternative method:
ΓÇó Remove YouTube.apk from /system/app (if there is any)
ΓÇó Uninstall YouTube if itΓÇÖs still on the drawer
ΓÇó Push my APK into /system/app (be careful with permissions / ownership)

Mod:
Download vidoe and music,*1080p* / 720p HD (over WiFi & 3G), screen off playback

To enable my extras, just press your phoneΓÇÖs menu button (or open the overflow menu top right corner) then tap ΓÇ£Advanced SettingsΓÇ¥
