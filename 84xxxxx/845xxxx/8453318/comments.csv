Firstly you haven't needed to use WAT remover at all, for years!!   Even back then it was a shit way of activating Windows.

Second,  Windows isnt ""cracked"" and it doesnt need to be because you can actually activate it with OEM activation via slic bios or bios loader.

You can simply download Win7 via actual Microsoft website and then activate VERY easily by using the ""Windows Loader"" by Daz of mydigitallife forums.

Alternatively just download one of the custom ISO's that have latest updates/hotfixes integrated and ten activate."
