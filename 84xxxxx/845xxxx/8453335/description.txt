!!Please Stop Destroying the Picture Aspect Ratio/Picture Framing with Cropping!!
                    For anyone Interested here's what I mean:
     This is a image where the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture aspect
  ratio is uncropped. Aka Panavision. Source: Grym's rip of Alien.

      This is a image where the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio 
          has been cropped to 1.85:1 picture aspect ratio by encoder.
         Notice the zoom in and the loss of proportion in the picture.
     Heads and objects is big and stretched! Source: WiKi's rip of Alien.

Please Encoders leave Your encodings Uncropped. That Way All get satisfaction. 
  Those who like their films cropped can watch'em cropped using their TV or 
software Video Player and Those who wants can watch your encodings uncropped. 
                    Everybody wins. Just a suggestion. :)
            
  No Sound? Try playing the Movie through VLC Software Video player (Free).

                                Thank You :)
