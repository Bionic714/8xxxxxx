,Espana25,2013-05-09T01:52Z,"Don't know what's happening these days such good uploads coming in no matter how big or small sized they are they don't happen to get seeded at all and this one's also suffering from the same problem come on guys it is a humble request that please do keep this on seeding as this ones not a useless thing to download we are all waiting on this one to get as soon as we could ,i promise to seed myself for longer time as i got no bandwidth restrictions . "
,madmike521,2013-05-09T02:21Z,"Thanks for the upload!!

,lantonovdelagpe,2013-05-09T02:34Z,"@kingashi

Hey dude ! If you upload a torrent on TPB, you have to seed. -_-"
,snake4445,2013-05-09T03:06Z,Thanks kingashi.  I'm churning away at the 52% mark with a download speed of 0.5kb.  Hopefully by morning I can get it all and keep seeding away in the process
,kingashi,2013-05-09T03:30Z,"Sorry guys my internet speed sucks ryt now but i wont stop seeding...:-)

,lawrj11,2013-05-09T07:18Z,Are you gonna post sound pack (1.10)?
,xnolunchx,2013-05-09T07:33Z,"Also, just a heads up. 122.176.147.88 is listed on A LOT of mail servers as being a spammer. Beware.

,kingashi,2013-05-09T08:51Z,"@ lawrj11

,kingashi,2013-05-09T10:46Z,"still fcking 3 seeders...people who downloaded 100% and stopped seeding should go take a big dik up their ass....bastards..

my mistake to upload stuff here..."
,kingashi,2013-05-09T10:55Z,hmmmm atleast some progress.....thanks to all who seed.....
,snake4445,2013-05-09T13:03Z,I appreciate the patience kingashi.  My download completed 3 hours ago and I'm continuing to seed at an average speed of 260Kbps.  Will do so for awhile since the next major AXE update to version 1.20 won't be for another 5-6 months.  Damn can't wait to fly this thing.
,kingashi,2013-05-09T13:30Z,looooll..dont worry you'll get your hands on the next version as it comes out..till the time fly the bird and enjoy...

Could you please upload stevo sound pack v 1.10 for the Airbus?"
,turontado117,2013-05-10T10:56Z,THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
,FSXler,2013-05-10T11:55Z,"Hello!

can anybody tell me how to delete the Airbus  COMPLETELY without deninstaller?

inclusive ALL registry entries etc.

my Problem, since Version 1.03 I got no ILS Localizer Dot on PFD and Deviation bar on ND anymore... actually, ILS ist working but not displaying. I guess  a Major Problem/failure has happend during deinstalling/updating to another version.

before V1.10 I had Version 1.04, but this time the dinstaller reported an error so that I had to delete the Bus manually, but with Version 1.10 the old failure lasts....

cheers 
Marc"

,maddog7777,2013-05-10T19:48Z,@xnolunchx-- You should use a program called peer block. It blocks unwanted spammers trying to access your computer or real or fake IP addresses that are spamming torrents and things like that. Plus it helps with seeding and helps increase seeding speeds. 
,aliyasneo,2013-05-11T06:03Z,Its asking for a password upon installation.What will that be King?
,kingashi,2013-05-11T11:16Z,"@ aliyasneo
