An 2 different methods step by step guide with description (and a Compinfo.ini file for 2012D version) for those who wants to install Volvo VIDA on a computor with less than the aquired 2.7GB RAM


I have set the included Compinfo.ini file for computors with minimum 512MB RAM, I think you should'nt go bellow that for usable performance.



The steps in Method #2 (but not the specific Compinfo.ini file that's made for the 2012D version) should work on VIDA 2011 series to, inc 2012A, B and C.


The tutorial is just a guideline, you maybe find an easier way to use this info yourself when you get the concept of it.




Cheers,, and don't forget to seed this with your fellow man.
