,Squito3,2013-05-16T17:50Z,"URGENT:

Hi all. I downloaded this and i have followed the instructions carefully. When i get to the page where I have to enter any fake Order number, email and name and then copy the crack across and click next, the installer just says NOT RESPONDING.

I am using windows Vista so should I be doing something different? 

Any help will be very much appreciated. "
