,hat_coat_door,2013-05-09T05:45Z,"Shit, might as well drop the cash for this bird. No one has managed to crack it. Snakeye, where art thou?! :("
,aarque,2013-05-09T13:31Z,"Isn't that too funny. It's happened so many times. So glad I never learned to crack stuff or I'd be gone too like Komu, DCrack/Mr Hands; too early to tell on dear Snakeye, but yes.

And the multiple torrents is a straight up TOS violation, under the category ""bad torrents > spam."" You should go to this link, create an account and ask them to remove the duplicates before someone else does:

,fenriz747,2013-05-09T16:59Z,"This is the same version as previous uploaded and deleted from TPB ?? Majestic release new version 1.006.
Installation without customer code, email and name is very easy, but after that we have all sytems offline and no landing grears. To crack aircraft, someone must decompile mjc84_main.dll and patch it because dll checks activation for a REG entry which is unique per machine. "
,Airbuspfd,2013-05-10T04:59Z,"I managed to have a little look t it. Apparently the gauge looks for a registry entry which I guess would be the registration details from the installer. I haven't manged to crack it, but I'll keep looking. If I can get around the call to this check then maybe we'll get somewhere. I get CTDs when I modify the key location.

Here's what I found, maybe it'll help others:
