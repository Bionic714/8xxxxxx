Summary: "Love Rain" depicts a 1970's pure love and a love from the present day ΓÇª at the same time. It shows how the offsprings of a previous ill-fated couple, who met in the 1970s, managed to meet and fall in love. Seo In Ha and Kim Yoon Hee, a fine art student who devotes his love to only one woman and a shy, elegant beauty, met and fell in love with each other during college in the 1970s but unfortunately their love was fated to never be. Now in the present 21st century Korea, Seo In Ha's son, Seo Joon (a liberal photographer) meets and falls in with the daughter of Kim Yoon Hee, Yuri, a cheerful and energetic girl whose personality is the opposite of that of her mother's.
