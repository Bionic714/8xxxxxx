The Godfather Complete 720p
===========================

This is Coppola's 1972 masterpiece, with the deleted (or extra) scenes
inserted into the movie to make an extended film of 3 hours 18 mins.

The movie was ripped from the Bluray. The 16 extra scenes were also included
on the Bluray but these appear to have been taken directly from the full
length TV saga, and were NTSCI 480i. I de-interlaced and inverse tele-synced
the extra scenes and scaled them up to 720p; their aspect ratio is 
preserved, so the extra scenes are 1080 x 720 within the normal 1280 x 720
frame of the movie (they have a 100 pixel black vertical border at each side).

The English subtitles were converted to SRT using VobSub, and this includes
the extra scenes. The smaller SRT is the forced subtitles (where non-English
dialogue is in use), the larger one has the full text.
