,shadowpdf,2013-05-09T03:28Z,Thanks for collecting this all in one place each week.  Makes it very convenient.  Anybody know why the files sizes keep getting bigger and bigger?  It's getting kind of unwieldy.

,memelpx,2013-05-09T18:20Z,"Thanks, bro! Agree with you, never liked the Ravagers, and Team 7 was ok, but i just stoped reding it, wasn't really feeling it. Deathstroke was fun, kind of slow and repetitive, but fun, "

Thanks though."

I suggest using webp, files are 50% smaller for the same quality.
webp is now supported by cdisplayex !"
,LeoLion94,2013-05-21T10:01Z,I can't seem to get Batman to work. When I open it in the reader all I get is one page showing action figures and nothing else. I downloaded twice and still had the same problem.
