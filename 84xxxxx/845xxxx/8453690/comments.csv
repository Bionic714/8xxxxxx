,Ptolomeii,2013-05-09T01:48Z,Aparently worked...
,Ptolomeii,2013-05-09T02:11Z,I have to say: It creates an undeletable library (.dll) msdaora.dll that is not a Win8 file system. I do not know if this file is hazardous. I have not had problems until now.
,underthaker,2013-05-09T14:20Z,By applying this activator updates may be updated in Windows?
,Ptolomeii,2013-05-09T17:02Z,"Problems appear if antivirus is installed. If antivirus recognizes cracked files and automaticaly it deletes those files, system can not run task manager crashes and ""open with..."" function does not work.

All files created with this activator run without problems only if PC have not installed an antivirus software or an exception is running.

I had to roll back to Windows 7."
