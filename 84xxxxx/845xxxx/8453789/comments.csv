,cheublawm,2013-05-11T07:28Z,"Dumb Ass American Comment above.

Do u think that all of the world should speak exactly the same as you then?????

We ""Brits"" actually invented the language that you try to speak although we speak it correctly.

Look forward to watching the movie now!!"
,micrors4,2013-05-11T08:30Z,"Actually the British did not create the English language, it originated in western Germany and was brought to Britain by Germanic invaders. "
,genrlpaulus,2013-05-11T20:08Z,"@ micrors4  The English language was not brought to Briton by German invaders.  When the 3 major Germanic tribes (Saxon, Engle and Jute) invaded Briton, the three tribal languages combined with a little help from Latin and the many local dialects to create English.  English is not a true language as such and added a lot of French during the Norman invasion as well."
,hdoggg007,2013-05-11T20:20Z,"@Cheub, you got pwned by micros.  History is your friend.  "

,DJ_SEVEN,2013-05-12T02:11Z,"Saxons, Angles and jutes in the 5th, 6th centuary to be exact!"
,avacacmasta,2013-05-12T03:32Z,"^^^^ Actually, I believe Al Gore invented English"
,mwhip,2013-05-12T03:52Z,"@cheublawm - Speaking as an American (I was born here), you are right about the ""stupid"" comment. Americans pride themselves on their stupidity. As far as speaking English correctly, say these words out loud:

Idea. Does it have an ""R"" at the end?
Secretary. Does it end with ""tree""?
Can't - Does it sound like the C-bomb?
Under - What happened to the ""R""?

And just to dig a bit deeper into your ignorance... It was the French that won the American Revolution. "
,mwhip,2013-05-12T04:37Z,"@cheublawm - Oh, oh! I have another one that grates my nerves...

Say ""Literally"" - Does it sound like ""Lit-Ri-Lee""? What happened to the ""E"" and ""A""?

Maybe this would be a funny movie if the people speaking in it weren't so BLOODY annoying."
,frugging,2013-05-15T10:22Z,The English are the invadors from Germany. Anglo-Saxon.
,hdbrazzer,2013-05-16T03:22Z,"Shut you all

Don't know who invented English Language....
Now it is our language...Better you learn grammar from us.........we are Indians"
,Gulowsen,2013-05-16T17:11Z,"English also have input from Vikings .. But it doesent matter.. It's still the original language that americans and Aussies use, and a number of other places.

But really who cares.. Ive been to France and I'm usually happy as a panda when i'm on holday and can actually comunicate with the ""natives""  lol"

,bodierock,2013-06-01T01:28Z,"It is  called connected speech and depends on what word follows and many other factors. Usually we drop the consonant and add a schwa. Have a look at the IPA system. Depending on what country/ dialect  you use depends on how you pronounce a word. All are correct. 
Until the late 1890s only 20 percent of people in France spoke french as we know it.
And now for my racist rant.
Has anyone seen the new Die Hard. At the beginning he gets in the taxi and John tells him he is from america and then he gets a free cab ride ha ha ha ha ha ha. "

,JamieleeEchelon,2013-06-10T21:42Z,"It's amusing how you hate ""all Americans"" because you don't know all Americans... Just like I don't know all of ANY countries people...Also I don't hate any one Country...All people from every country of every race and religion have its IDIOTS and PIECES OF SHIT...So don't just blame the Americans..Especially since all you know of are the morons on T.V and in movies...I'm from New York and i'm not an ORANGE moronic Guido...I ACTUALLY READ!  BOOKS! not the back of cereal boxes! So go ahead and tell me how horrible my grammar and spelling and whatever else anyone would like to criticize is. Thanksss"
