NOTHiNG iS SAFE (DVD5 x3) iSRAEL'S 2006 WAR ON LEBANON

The extent of israhell's 2006 devastation of Southern Lebanon, the bombing of homes, schools, medical facilities, roads and bridges, repeated against Gaza in 2008, went largely unreported in the U.S. media. As in Iraq, the public's field of vision has been sanitized to the human cost of mass homicide.

This series is based on interviews with ordinary Lebanese citizens, heart wrenching stories of loss and determination against a backdrop of unimaginable destruction. In war, innocent civilians not only suffer the most; their voices are the first and most effectively silenced. These films let them speak.

 that it looked like the aftermath of September 11th, 100 times over.

4,000,000 cluster-bomblets were dropped on South Lebanon, littering the land with hundreds of thousands of unexploded bombs that await civilians. On January 30, 2008, an Israeli government-appointed commission investigated the July War, and found that Israel violated international law by contaminating civilian areas with cluster-bombs.
