,bhutu,2013-06-07T15:02Z,@vandetavicious: Initially I had installed a Win 8 WMC x64 bit on my system and had activated it with the Korean Pirate activator KJ_120929. After some updates my Win8 crashed and I had to repair it and installed the KJ_120929 again. But from that day the activation notification is appearing often and   I am unable to personalize. Although I am able to download apps from store and get all the necessary updates the blue screen of Activation Notification with the PC Settings button appear often. Also I have two more Windows OS namely WinXP Pro 32 bit and Win7 Ultimate 64 bit installed and currently have the Win7 bootmenu. Earlier I had the Win8 bootmenu. Will your activator solve my problem. Plz reply...
