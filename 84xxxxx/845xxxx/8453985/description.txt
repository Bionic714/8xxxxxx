This allows you to mount and modify Sparse data in
Android for Windows - BlueStacks
--------------------------------

This is the most common request I have gotten for support, enjoy!

1. Copy the contents of Block Device Tool GUI to 
c:programdatabluestacksandroid

2. Install OSFmount
3. Install Ext2 Volume Manager

4. Reboot if asked
5. Run Block Device Tool GUI Eng.exe

--This will convert the SDcard.sparse AND Data.sparse
to .fs file systems

6. Run OSFmount and mount your SDcard.fs, copy your shit, unmount

7. Run Block Device Tool GUI Eng.exe again and convert to Sparse

Game Keyboard app just happened to find it's way into this torrent ;)

*you can move the SDcard.sparse and BDT gui to another folder
using the AW2 included BootToOther.reg  This will greatly
sped things up.

**not a lot of luck resizing yet!!
