The Gratitude Book Project: Celebrating 365 Days of Gratitude People from all walks of life join together in this collection of essays-one for every day of the year-about the things, people, circumstances, and events they're grateful for. Need a pick-me up? How about a gratitude adjustment? Look inside-you'll be grateful you did. Celebrating 365 Days of Gratitude is brimming over with appreciation and inside you will find evidence that harnessing the power of gratitude can be a life-changing force. These true life stories are about more than the polite "thank you" we casually exchange every day. They're testimonials to the people and things we often take for granted. Join us in this growing movement of people from around the world who have committed to asking themselves this simple yet profound question every day of the week-what am I grateful for?
