,vile1313,2013-05-30T00:26Z,I heard from a friend that this pings back to somewhere for tracking? Whats the scoop?
,MaHa1969,2013-05-30T14:12Z,all the ping urls have been changed. theres an update xml that pulls from gslinks or amazon that has had the gslinks removed too. 
,Fatalfoxdie87,2013-06-10T13:05Z,did you cracked this software because i have 5.7.2 but it needs to be cracked?
,MaHa1969,2013-06-11T22:59Z,Yes I did. Seed it and Ill start on that one.
