Geek Squad MRI 5.7.1 Reskinned and Cracked With 5.7.0 Cracked Fixed.
Fixed the Boot menu to work with Dell. Windows Xp Recovery and a couple other things were missing from 5.7.0 so I fixed it. Should have gotten all the past and 15 day warnings this time, but it I didn't, It wont expire. Last time I repacked the exe's so it would fit on a cd still, but this time since it's over 1 gig, no reason to repack.
