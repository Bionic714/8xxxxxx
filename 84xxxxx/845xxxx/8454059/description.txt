Exercise Personal Training 101 provides a message of empowerment for personal trainers who believe in the holistic development of their clients. The key philosophy of the book is to help personal trainers of exercise to empower their clients with good problem-solving and decision-making skills concerning their health and well-being. Good personal trainers become great personal trainers when they practise HELP with their clients and help them to become better problem-solvers and decision makers rather than telling them what to do, by offering sound and scientifically-based information that is personalised and appropriate.

Personal exercise training books that address associated issues of the profession are rare and not easily available. Many personal trainers are self-taught, do not have the required qualifications and are motivated by the amount of money that they can make rather than the health and well-being of clients. Readers will learn what makes a good personal trainer and those who are in the profession can benefit by equipping themselves with the knowledge, skills and attitudes that will make them a great exercise personal trainer. Excellent personal trainers can be lifestyle and wellness coaches who are renowned for their great listening skills and high emotional quotient. They exceed client expectations at every opportunity. Special features in the book include concept statements, strategies for action, technology updates, in the news, key points and technical jargon, web-resources and follow-up references. The book is a must-read whether you are starting out in personal training or you are an experienced personal trainer.
