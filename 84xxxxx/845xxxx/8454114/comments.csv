,Bmack2013,2013-05-09T21:36Z,"Thought the same meself imdb doesn't list gangster neither does rotten tomatoes or google for that matter the title is as seen in the description its mid life gangster not gangster and its not about Edwin Boyd either its about a totally different person altogether called Evan ""bullet"" James think the uploader got mixed up along the way some where with the description any how thanks for the upload like always and for those who don't get the description a little bit of time and investigating is all it takes peace : ) "
