[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-10T05:20Z,"Hulu has all 56 episodes, and I've been watching them there with short modern commercial breaks.  

Desi Arnaz appeared in at least 4 episodes as a Spanish matador named Raphael Delgado, starting in the fourth show.

Unfortunately I ran out of my downloader app's free trial and not prepared to get more of them.

But if that changes you'll know!"
