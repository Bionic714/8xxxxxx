,Mowjowey,2013-05-09T06:58Z,"@pinel:Season 12 is the latest season. Episode 1 aired May 1st, Episode 2 aired today."
,Jethed,2013-05-09T11:45Z,anyone else stuck at 98.7%? same thing happened with last weeks 720p episode at about 99% :/
,Jethed,2013-05-09T11:46Z,oops.... wrong one...
,Vuori,2013-05-09T16:07Z,"As was stated last episode it was the TENTH anniversary of Mythbusters so this is season 11 considering it started on season 1 not 0.
Mythbusters seasons are counted by air-year officially like 2012-season or 2013-season. 2013-season = s11.
So there!"
