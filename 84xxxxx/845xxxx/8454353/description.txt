Dramatisation of the Len Deighton Thriller.

What if Churchill had met with Hitler and started talks about the terms of a British surrender in the war, but rejected the German proposals, and that subsequently anyone who learned of this meeting had been marked for XPD - the expedient demise of enemy agents?

ThatΓÇÖs the starting point for this thriller which looks at what happens when a file of this meeting emerges and MI6, the KGB and the CIA are drawn into the hunt for those at the meeting. A group of former SS officers in West Germany seek to use papers about a meeting between Hitler and Churchill during the war as a pretext for seizing power; British agent Boy Stuart is tasked with keeping the documents under wraps.
