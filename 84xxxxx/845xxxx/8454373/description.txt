The Worst Journey In the World was an account of Captain Scott's ill-fated expedition of 1911/12 to reach the South Pole. It was  written in 1922 by Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a member of the expedition. Full of British spirit and stiff upper lip, this two part dramatisation of the book makes for fascinating listening, even though we all know the outcome.
