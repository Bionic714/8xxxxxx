Hi STFmv,

I have an unrelated request, and am just going to post it here, if that's allright. It's for the 2008/9 Dark Horse mini-series ""Mister X: Condemned"", preferrably the Minutemen scans. The specific release tags, in case that helps, would be

Mister X- Condemned 01 (of 4) (2009) (Minutemen-Zone)
Mister X - Condemned 02 (of 04) (2009) (Minutemen-DTs&Xer)
Mister X - Condemned 03 (of 04) (2009) (Dark Horse) (Minutemen-Rosie)
Mister X - Condemned 04 (of 04) (2009) (c2c) (Minutemen-DTs&Xer)

They were included in the various (ComicPirates and others) weeklies in early 2009, but none of those are properly seeded any longer, so that's little help. I tried trawling cyberlockers, but again without success. So, any chance?

If you have or come across any other of the older (pre-2012, ""Hard Candy"") ""Mister X"" stuff, making it a pack would be even better, needless to say. ;)

Thanks in advance, for trying, at any rate - and for all your other uploads, of course!"

if you can find a torrent file or magnet link to Single Comics Request Fill #79 (Week of January 1st, 2012) , someone re-upped the Minutemen scans... and that was only 16 months ago. but i've had no luck so far with that, either!"

Hey, cool, that's already more search-fu than I could muster! Guess someone made my very request a little while back, heh.

I did find the torrent, it's obfuscatingly called ""SCR - 01-01-12"" and appears to originate from Demonoid (RIP), with BitSn00p ( bitsn00p.com/scr-01-01-12-q32879606.html ) being the only mirror at this time. Shows 0/0, but I'm giving it a go, anyway, of course! And there might be some cyberlocker upload of that pack out there somewhere that's still live, too - as you say, 16 months is not all that much. Cheers for now! :)"

Ahhh, that's why I got ""database error"" when I tried to post that reply this morning - mentioning other torrent sides not allowed. I kind of knew that that might be the case, but the error message is so unspecific that I didn't put it together until just now. Tsk."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-10T05:43Z,"there's a black list of urls and/or phrases you can't type. like sometimes i will recommend magazine3k.com but then i'll have to type I-S-O-H-U-N-T dot com  ;-)

and yeah, demonoid was so rich with uploads, it's sad when we're unable to find stuff that originated there. another site where a lot of stuff was archived is filesonic. i hit that brick wall at least every other search, it seems."

Woot! I did not succeed in tracking down the comics myself, but I did succeed in finding the right place to ask for them, it seems.

*runs off to make them into a torrent now*"
