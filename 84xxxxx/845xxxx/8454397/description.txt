Aspen Comics proudly presents their first ever super-hero series, IDOLIZED! Welcome to the mind-bending new comic book series about a TV show where super-powered teens and 20-somethings are competing for the ultimate dream-prize: a guaranteed spot in that world's top super-group, The Powered Protectors. The chance of winning offers fame, fortune, massive endorsement deals and, of course, a chance to actually save the world. Kids who dream of being worshipped as the next great, iconic hero would be falling all over themselves to get on -- and hopefully even win -- the show. Against this backdrop, IDOLIZED is the story of a girl with fledgling superpowers and a dark past, who seeks revenge, and ultimately finds redemption, over the course of competing in this televised superhero competition show. It's True Grit meets American Idol...with capes!
