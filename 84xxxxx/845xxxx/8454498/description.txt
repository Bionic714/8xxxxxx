For a band that, for the most part, had nothing more than a free album and an EP out, IΓÇÖve jumped on these guysΓÇÖ bandwagon, moved to the front row and bought the fucking t-shirt. IΓÇÖve called them your new favorite band, one of the brightest up and coming spots in this genre, and even insinuated that Two Cow might wanna watch their back when it comes to these kids. High praise, no doubt but about 3 months ago, when I got my copy of Simple Machines I immediately knew that the rain of praise from the 9b camp wasnΓÇÖt only high, it was wholly accurate.

For months IΓÇÖve been chomping at the bit to tell yΓÇÖall about this album and how incredibly awesome it is and now that itΓÇÖs outΓÇª.IΓÇÖm at a loss. What do I say that I havenΓÇÖt already repeated ad nauseum on twitter andI mean, how many times can I say that if youΓÇÖre a fan of Two Cow Garage you absolutely have to get this cd?

That raw edge that Dance To Forget and Truckstop Roses (both are available for free here and here) had has definitely been dialed down a little with Simple Machines, but thatΓÇÖs more a result of studio production than a softening band. Everything else about Simple Machines is spot-fucking-on. Including the incredibly well timed cameos of other 9b faves such as Two CowΓÇÖs Micah, Drag The RiverΓÇÖs Snodgrass and Lizzie HuffmanΓÇÖs Lizzie.

So thatΓÇÖs it. I ainΓÇÖt got nothing else to say. If you like that punky, rocky, Southerny rock and roll thing, then meet Arliss Nancy, theyΓÇÖre one of your new favorite bands. Simple Machines is an album IΓÇÖll talk about again come year end lists. Simple Machines is an album IΓÇÖll still be listening to a year from now. Simple Machines is Essential Listening.
