The feathery tones of Haroula RoseΓÇÖs debut album, ΓÇ£These Open Roads,ΓÇ¥ are pretty enough to cause suspicion. Underneath her gentle finger-picked guitar and girlish but graceful voice, does this L.A.-based singer-songwriter, originally from Chicago, provide the song structure to support all this loveliness?

She does ΓÇö and each listen to her 11 songs (and one Mason Jennings cover) reveals a new melodic turn that the ear didnΓÇÖt pick up on before. Recruiting a stable of musicians, including Drive-By TruckersΓÇÖ John Neff on pedal steel, Orenda Fink from Azure Ray on vocals and producer Andy LeMaster (Bright Eyes, R.E.M.) on slide guitar and a slew of other instruments, Rose picked the right company to realize this highly textured collection that explores a few different moods, though always at a tender remove.

On ΓÇ£Simple Time,ΓÇ¥ with its peals of mandolin and plinking toy piano, Rose wishes to go back to a time thatΓÇÖs still ripe with hope. Over the playfully cantering rhythms of ΓÇ£Another Breakup Ballad,ΓÇ¥ she kicks a dodgy lover to the curb. But the fragmentary ΓÇ£Lavender MoonΓÇ¥ is the standout, a spooked love song kissed with atmospherics that would give Tom Waits the shivers.
