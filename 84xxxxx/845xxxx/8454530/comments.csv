[T],TxJag,2013-05-09T15:30Z,It's quite crazy though cause you can't keep up with his publication rate. He's got nearly a book a month coming out.
,a5h15hn3g1,2013-05-10T05:53Z,"@txjag
Yep you're right.
he is a beast when it comes to writing books :)"
,eheske,2013-05-10T06:20Z,Fantastic! You are really great!!!
[T],TxJag,2013-05-10T06:34Z,@a5h15hn3g1: I don't think he does a majority of the writing when he co-authors a book. He probably contributes but for the most part I think it's all in the name that sells and I think the co-author does most of the leg work in getting it done.
