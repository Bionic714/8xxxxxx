The BD was extremely pixelated so used deblock 1:1 to make it slightly smoother.
I added only the Ger sub from Blu-ray because all subs from the net were bad (date 12/07/2012).

Just one example;
@ 00:59:48 where it says:
"I used to enjoy being alone."

in all eng subs from net it says:
"I never liked to be alone."

LOL

As result all subs translated from those Eng subs are full of errors.
