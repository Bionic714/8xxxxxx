'Team Yankee' is our next FCUP series. Wiki say:

Team Yankee is a speculative fiction novel written in 1987 by Harold Coyle, then a major in the United States Army, whose subject is the actions of a company-sized armor unit of the United States Army in the World War III scenario as depicted by General Sir John Hackett in his novel, The Third World War. General Hackett's scenario takes place in 1985; Coyle never specifies the year, but it is assumed to take place in the late 1980s. While Hackett's book emphasizes strategy and world politics, Coyles features the experiences of the tank crews and infantrymen fighting on the front lines.

The novel achieved best-selling status and became a series of comic books, an Origins Award-winning board wargame and later a video game.

First Comics published a six-comic book series based on Team Yankee. David Drake wrote the strip and Rod Whigam illustrated.
