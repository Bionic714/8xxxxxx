,coute,2013-05-21T03:35Z,"Guys, this show is in trouble! If you like it, please consider watching it on tv or Hulu! This is not an anti-piracy message, I DO download this series as well because I can get it faster and at better quality through torrent but I also go and watch it on Hulu later to increase the ratings. I just really love this show and would hate to see it cancelled! Support Hannibal!"
