,Jethed,2013-05-09T11:46Z,anyone else stuck at 98.7%? same thing happened with last weeks 720p episode at about 99% :/ 
,safarusa,2013-05-09T13:04Z,stuck at 99.9% ?
,jsaucy11,2013-05-09T13:20Z,"yeah definitely stuck at 99%. The mkv is missing it's header making it unwatchable, even if you discontinue the other files in the torrent."
,afkuser2,2013-05-09T13:37Z,"Most people probably don't want to waste their bandwidth or time on 20MB sample files.
For that reason, I set all but the main video file to 'skip' in utorrent.  
If that's happening a lot, you won't get 100% of the torrent, which is perfectly fine unless for some stupid reason you want to watch the 30 second sample video."
,jsaucy11,2013-05-09T14:23Z,"This isn't a problem with the sample. The 99.9% is an issue with the episode mkv, not the sample. It's missing it's header as I've said. So no matter if you choose not to download all the other files in the torrent, you will still be stuck at 99%. This happened last week as well."
,tyrael_plpl,2013-05-09T14:24Z,@ 99.9% here and missing 256 kB chunk... what the hell?
,afkuser2,2013-05-09T18:35Z,I got 100% of the actual show file (skipped all the other files).  Took about 15 min to download.  You guys are doing something wrong.
,Lant,2013-05-09T22:07Z,"@afkuser2 
Thanks, that actually helped."
,powergen501,2013-05-10T01:38Z,Skipping all the other files helped me as well. Got 100% of the show file.
