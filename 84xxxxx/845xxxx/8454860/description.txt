Flickit is fun 2d physics arcade style game where you try to gain the highest score possible. Simply flick the player an watch as it collides with different objects, some of which will propel your player further or stop it completely.

If you like the game or what it can become you can support it with just 1 dollar, I dont need $500 this is the minimum limit indiegogo sets. I actually would be happy to get 99 persons to pledge $1 so i can at least get the IOS developer license.

Thank you and share with a friend if you can.
