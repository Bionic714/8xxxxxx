[V],psspss,2013-05-09T08:48Z,"

LOL seems the hard subs are about 1 minute out of sync. nothing i can do to fix it.. could be worse though.. 

source was the same "
,Chucky110,2013-05-09T11:03Z,"Yeah news about rich being fired is old news, over a month ago"

I did upload the torrent I did last year promo
some of their work.. and behind scenes stuff if not got it get it.. if still seeded though "
[V],psspss,2013-05-09T16:36Z,"they milking the docu too with their tours still no dvd even though they promised to sale them
when that happens they know it leak to p2p for sure
I guess each town they do they must rank in 200K atleast .. several screenings a day in a week with 1000 chairs at what $30 a head? or was it $100

Ryan meant to have cancer too"
[V],psspss,2013-05-09T16:36Z,"

Note no haunted collector or deep south from me this week and prob next as got 10gb to last 10 days now ://

I see ET has them up though"
,twijjit,2013-05-10T21:10Z,"@psspss - I can help ya seed if it'll help ya with yer bandwidth. My ISP claims to have my bandwidth cap ""on hold"", so I'm taking advantage of it. Drop me an email at staff [-at-] ytepisodes dot com if I can help ya out.."
[V],psspss,2013-05-11T04:35Z,"sorry I dont trust anyone and I dont know you
thanks for the offer

but it wont help.. its like a seedbox.. its extra cost but yo
still have to upload and download to it the stuff
which uses the same ISP datacap !

sure you get it faster from me and I use less bandwidth sharing instead of ratio 1.3-1.5 i would get 1-1 

really what would help is People stop connecting and leeching before its seeded out but of course antip2p prob do it on purpose"
,thamantaz_77,2013-05-13T12:53Z,"Good quality, but the hard-coded subs are WAY off sinc."
[V],psspss,2013-05-13T17:57Z,"the subs dont matter if you speak english.. just ignore them.. you can always grab the other ones to come out..

if your a fookn moaner.. of course it took another day to show up or 7 hours.. but you never know if a episode is ever going to show does one

the quality is just fine.. its a HD source just has subs that some idiot hard coded and  1 min out of sync"
[V],psspss,2013-05-13T17:58Z,"actually its not a 1min even.. maybe 10seconds
gets better as progresses into the show"
[V],psspss,2013-05-13T18:02Z,"atleast i bother to title a fookn shows filename

all these upload by others and they cant be bothered

I dont know why I bother here really"
[V],psspss,2013-05-16T04:49Z,"im out of data still wont reset for 4 days so

Ep8 afg and tvteam will have to add this week sorry"
,bielzibob,2013-05-17T04:13Z,hope u can upload episode 8 of hardcore pawn.
[V],psspss,2013-05-17T12:05Z,"i had a look and I dont think it aired this week Ep8
its not listed in wiki and no full episode hosted at tru
not that anyone can get unless got a usa cable
tvrage if listed might of been wrong
but its not listed there either was it a holiday in usa or something happened at the store so it didnt air?
http://www.tvrage.com/Hardcore_Pawn/episode_list
so maybe why its not shown up
