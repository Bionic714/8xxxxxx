* Hazell Dean - Who's Leaving Who.avi
* Johnny Logan - Shine On (Live Nyhetsmorgon 2011).avi
* Johnny Logan - What's Another Year (Live Nyhetsmorgon 2011).avi
* John Lennon - Blue Suede Shoes (Live Toronto Peace Festival 1969).mpg
* John Lennon - Give Peace A Chance (Live Toronto Peace Festival 1969).mpg

Some of only a few bytes being missed. Thanks in the name of a number of TPB members and long time ROSAmannen fans!

Your videos releases are so great - the torrents must live forever!
