DESCRIPTION
_______________________________
He was the man who unintentionally created the sport of MMA in 1993, and the creator(along with his brother) of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, who influenced more fighters than anyone else in the history of combat by showing how his martial art style was superior to everyone else's, and now you can re-live his amazing career with Ultimate Royce Gracie. This comprehensive Blu-ray collection captures the Jiu-Jitsu master at his best with nearly six hours of content, including interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and of course, his classic fights. If you want to know why MMA is the biggest combat sport in the world, or why the UFC is the most recognizable industry in the MMA world, then Ultimate Royce Gracie will tell you! Without Royce Gracie, we would never have MMA or the UFC, so it's any MMA fan's duty to watch this documentary and learn about the sport they love, right from Royce Gracie's own mouth, along with his friends, family, those he influenced, and the UFC.
