,Pride420,2013-05-22T01:13Z,"the repack ran, however it is missing some files. Namely its missing the portrait files for the Babylon faction. Causes no real problems with the game if you disable the babylon faction content in the DLC menue. Would be nice if you could make another repack including the missing content."
