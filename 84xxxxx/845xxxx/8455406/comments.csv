I trust you had your flag flying and a candle burning in the window."
,froogAL,2013-05-09T20:23Z,"My ""freak flag"" may have been flying (per CSNY)

,hoppyharrington,2013-05-10T04:19Z,"I am assuming you are referring to Crosby Stills Nash & Young rather than some CSI spinoff (actually I had to look it up as I am not a dirty hippy and just a freak).

I uploaded Saxophone Supremacy just for you.

I hope you like the cover. I like to imagine it as a photo of Jessica Chastain way back from in her early modeling career, perhaps taken on the ""other"" casting couch before she went on to win the AWFJ (Alliance of Women Film Journalists) prestigious EDA award for her role as ""The Motherfucker"" in Zero Dark Thirty.

,hoppyharrington,2013-05-10T04:22Z,You know I'm just joking right???
,hoppyharrington,2013-05-10T04:28Z,"Unlike on Demonoid, no one seems to care enough to comment up in here. 

Uploading is kind of a thankless task.

""Pay It Forward"" (whatever that means) is all well and good, but are we not warm blooded mammals and such???

Anyhow, thanks for this one."
,froogAL,2013-05-10T17:20Z,"correct on all counts

I wonder how Kathryn Bigelow became such 
an expert on the intricacies (aka mayhem) of
modern war?
Perhaps she was embedded and got to wear a
helmet.  Another ""eureka moment"" could have 
been learning that FULL METAL JACKET was not
some sort of body armor.

""Pay it fwd"" is, as I recall.....the title of a Kevin Spacey movie.  It means simply this: showing gratitude and kindness to others in response
to kindness received; rather than returning the
kindness back to it's original source.  Ideally a
point is reached where we're all just one smiling
and jolly human family...ie  No more knife fights

It was probably a DISNEY movie.......fA"
,hoppyharrington,2013-05-12T08:18Z,"""Magnificent Obsession"" is another film.

There are two versions.

I prefer Douglas Sirk's, as it is extremely soapy, but both are good.

Haven't seen the Spacey film."
,froogAL,2013-05-14T21:51Z,"I'll watch it using my new HDMI cable and ""short throw"" projector and report back later

I've got a JONES for noir from the same era

If a person chooses the bicycle instead of the automobile he/she can buy useful stuff instead
of petrol"
,froogAL,2013-05-17T19:33Z,"the movie ""M.O."" was a bit of a ""snorer"" for me..

Literally...I nodded off at around 10PM and when I awoke I was seeing bluescreen

The boat accident effect was inventive...perhaps ROCK hit a rock?   or maybe they threw the camera into the air several times while filming  and left the rest to editing.....fA    unabashed movie and music snob"
,hoppyharrington,2013-05-19T12:52Z,"So I take it that you don't want to give Rock Hudson a big warm bear hug anytime soon.

I guess ""All That Heaven Allows"" will not be on your immediate viewing list.

Well, to each his own.

Really though, if you don't pay any attention, how can you appreciate Jane Wyman's martyrdom or anything really???

,hoppyharrington,2013-05-19T14:37Z,"Some Snob!!!

Oh, I fell asleep three minutes into the movie and literally woke up when it was over, how snobbish of me.

You need snob lessons buddy!!!"
