You wouldn't know from listening to her songs but Ane Brun is from Scandinavia. Her vocals certainly doesn't betray her european heritage. She doesn't have an accent. She actually sounds more american than Nina Nastasia or Edith Frost and her guitar playing has a bluesy, southern quality to it. Whether or not she puts it on, the Americana feel to her compositions is very effective. Her voice will remind some of Joni Mitchell, a cleaner, clearer Mitchell and aside from the jaunty "So you did it again", her songs are more or less of the same persuasion, pretty, sincere folk pop songs about romance and isolation.
