A simple script to play a short audio alert when your torrent has finished downloading.

I downloaded this a while back, and it's a great addition to your favorite torrent client (BitTorrent, uTorrent, Vuze).

I wanted to give the original uploader credit here - but do you think I can find it again now? In a word NO.

Anyway thanks to whoever it was... The original only had one sound though. I modified it a bit in order to include a selection of 25 additional sound files for some variety.
