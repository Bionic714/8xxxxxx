Hospital rules won't allow a patient to have his own private nurse until doctors find out that Rebeca is not there for medical reasons. Nurse Rachel has a soft spot for a patient that's really down on his luck. Lucky for him, she's about to lift his spirits to new found heights. The Doctor needs a huge favor from Jazy and she's not too pleased. Lucky for her, a good deed goes a long, long way. During surgery the doctor finds that Nurse Sarah is completely useless and wants to know how she graduated from nursing school. Nurse Yurizan's past is catching up with her and she desperately wants to make sure no one else finds out her secrets.
