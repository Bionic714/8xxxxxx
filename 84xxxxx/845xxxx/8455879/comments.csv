[V],simon200,2013-05-09T13:55Z,Is this 1 cam audio as well?
[T],xxxlavalxxx,2013-05-09T13:56Z,"yes,cam audio"
[V],simon200,2013-05-09T13:59Z,Cheers for getting back so quick
[V],HeroMaster,2013-05-09T16:22Z,"Well xxxlavalxxx you forgot the notes of this release, which you originally noted, it goes like it:

""This is still CAM AUDIO which switches audio from English to korean version, really bad to hear just encoded it in 720p, overall nice work buddy for getting it done but still bad audio"" 

LINE Audio is on its way so soon we would get a better and nice release cheers again TODE!"
,yadam2001,2013-05-09T19:23Z,this is avi file!!! wtf
,rajakumar,2013-05-09T19:33Z,"@xxxlavalxxx:

Thank you.

A: 7/10
V: 8/10

waiting for better English audio.

Can you please upload better copy of Evil Dead 2013."
,notnowplz,2013-05-09T21:22Z,@yadam2001....no shit....what else is it suppose to be right now???
,Nasada,2013-05-09T22:51Z,"@notnowplz The title says ""x264"" so it should be an .mp4 file."
,XONi49,2013-05-09T23:37Z,"@yadam2001 and Nasada  x264 is the Codec used avi and mp4 are containers 
learn the diff"
,Orwell-84,2013-05-09T23:56Z,Thanx mang! Soon.... its almost a complete film ;)
,riahc3,2013-05-10T00:02Z,"WOW, a R6 already? We just need better audio. Havent downloaded it but from the comments..."
,Boofster,2013-05-10T00:09Z,Does it have the after credits scene?
,gozinya,2013-05-10T03:34Z,Almost DVD clarity with some random stuttering and choppiness. Cam audio is echoey but clear enough. There are some pretty major sync issues intermittently throughout. Quite watchable overall considering it's recent release.
,mezzam,2013-05-10T17:11Z,"Video quality is good for such a quick release of a R6 version. Tho with watermark, but nothing that bothers you.

The sound is as previously stated still cam audio, as for me who is used to 1500 kbps DTS it's quite the change. 

Taking in mind the quick release its no biggie, watchable for sure, appreciate this!"
,tiffani7772003,2013-05-11T02:28Z,"can anyone get American Ghost Hunter, 2012 release can't find it anywhere,,,please!!!!"
,jcracken,2013-05-11T06:11Z,Audio is very slightly off. If you set VLC Player to -0.2 seconds in Track Synchronization it seems to work really well.
,jcracken,2013-05-11T08:15Z,"Also the scenes only in Chinese are the Chinese-exclusive scenes made only for the Chinese version. They include Fan Bing Bing, a Chinese actress and aren't actually very important to the plot."
,q2323,2013-05-11T16:07Z,screens looks much better than the actual movie..
,loafgiver,2013-05-12T04:03Z,NO FUCK ME
,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-05-12T07:52Z,"Why the fuck has no one uploaded this with Line Audio yet? 

Fucking bull shit. "
,zmogusnr1,2013-05-12T13:17Z,"Do not watch, the cam audio ruins the experience."
,nonobvious,2013-05-12T20:09Z,POS
,PPandora,2013-05-12T22:55Z,"I legitimately just made an account just to comment on this. It's pretty sad to see people complain about the quality of videos that are uploaded. You are getting this for free! you have done nothing at all to deserve seeing this, but yet, you are still getting to see it. Just shut up and watch the video. If you do not like it, go buy the DVD and then you have the right to complain. Until that time comes, Fill a muzzle with with some fruity pebbles, strap it to your face and appreciate the things that are handed to you in life."
,Corakus323,2013-05-13T06:09Z,"DVD's not out yet, dipshit."
,Vorrrz,2013-05-13T08:26Z,@Corakus323 He never said it was a dvd rip you dumb fuck so shut ya mouth
,ictstuff,2013-05-13T10:36Z,"Haters please go away. Quality is great.

If you want HD than wait on BRrip or DVDrip. Or steal one from a factory :) (not so smart but hey)

Everyone is expecting to much. You got to be happy with what you get."
,Crusader7,2013-05-13T10:44Z,"I have to say this... I went to the cinema and watched the movie. AFter that, went home and watched it again from this torrent. Wathced it again yesterday. HOPE THEY MAKE MORE EPIC MOVIES LIKE THAT"
,bodassa,2013-05-13T10:57Z,"the audio is mixed (Eng CAM and mandarin dubed)
and its not the full movie"
,PPandora,2013-05-13T15:27Z,"@Corakus323 Thanks for the heads-up man, I never realized the movie that is still in theaters is not on DVD yet. Wow, I am so glad you are here to help me out or else I may not have ever known. Let's slow things down a little bit, read closely and use the common sense you where given. Obviously the DVD is not out yet, what I am saying is this. When you get something you are not suppose to have yet, FOR FREE! Don't bitch and complain about the quality. If you want to bitch and complain, wait like everyone else in the world and get it when it comes to DVD. Once it does you can take $20 to Wal-Mart and buy it. Hopefully you have time to do that with your busy schedule of masturbation, sleeping & Twinkie deep throating. How do people in this world become so moronic and pathetic? "
,bigboy8312003,2013-05-13T18:10Z,"for a cam the quality is not bad at all, but on the other hand the audio is horrible. I watch cams all the time but the audio on this one is very very bad 

v:7 A: 2"
,Bmack7263,2013-05-13T18:37Z,"Hey man could you upload a really good copy of every film that starts with a g? Then could you drop by and fix my pc? Myhouse is god awful filthy mess, swing by sterilize.

And upload a quality copy of ""The Birth of a Nation'  I have a copy but the color and sound sucks.
Later personel slave dude."
,clawdigga,2013-05-13T18:40Z,PPandora shut the fuck up... bitch
,PPandora,2013-05-13T23:48Z,"@clawdigga -Everyone beware, we have a badass over here talking smack behind a keyboard..."
,valthonis_c,2013-05-13T23:58Z,"As a CAM version i would say V:9  A:7.
The problem is that when i go to the HD list i expect an HD movie (which is a DVDrip or better, not a CAM) and since this movie is in the HD list then my rating would be V:3 A:0.
Normally i would sort the movies by seeders and make sure that it's uploaded by a skull but from now on i think i'll go with YIFI's uploads only. I dont care if the movie is out yesterday or a 100 years ago, i just wanna make sure that i get the thing that i want even if i have to wait a long time. so please put this movie where it belongs with ppl who know what they r doing such as Bone, Yakomo, LegendET and the rest."
,Ramoa,2013-05-14T01:09Z,You dumb bastards. Worrying and arguing about quality. Here's a secret: quality is an ILLUSION on a downloaded file. Not to mention 90% of you assholes will wind up watching this in a computer screen. You want quality? Stop being a cheap fuck and pay for a movie ticket. A theater is the only place where you'll get the actual quality you're insulting each other about.
,usr420,2013-05-14T02:47Z,"@Ramoa: While a movie like this is still worthy of being seen in an IMAX (regular theaters aren't worth it) I'll wait for a Bluray DTS HD Master Audio rip in 3D a few months from now. Who needs the theater when you have 7.1 1080p 3D @ home? With the right hardware and software, movie theaters are obsolete."
,Polyblendz,2013-05-14T10:51Z,"V - 7/10
A - 2/10

Audio is horrible especially when the audience in the cinemas are laughing throughout annoying. I don't care if I downloaded this for free!  

Best to find a better copy then this!"
,MoonDown,2013-05-14T17:44Z,"Saw the movie at the cinema and it was awesome. Don't destroy it by download this torrent, wait for a better one. "
,von-mats,2013-05-14T21:42Z,Best movie Ever ! Cant wait for proper download 
,MFINN23,2013-05-15T03:25Z,You should be required to write CAM in the title if it's recorded in a theater.
,wasimdon,2013-05-15T07:59Z,good cam rip
,wasimdon,2013-05-15T08:00Z,http://www.subtitleseeker.com/Download-movie-2849472/Iron+Man+3+2013+R6+720p+x264+AC3-TODE    subtitles english download from here
,Plan9x128,2013-05-16T15:57Z,"Why is the shit in HD category? Well technically the picture is 720p, but still, R6 release rip? Is US so poor that they can't even wait for decent BRRip? 

V - 7/10
A - 1/10"
,mrwolf71,2013-05-16T19:29Z,Why is this listed as R6 if it's a CAM?
,dididie,2013-05-16T23:58Z,"You troll cunt.  First of all this piece of shit audio isn't even entirely in english, half of the beginning (which you need to hear to understand what the fucking backdrop of the plot will be) is in japanese or some asian language.  Great for the mathmaticians, but WHAT THE FUCK?  

Great audio for what it's worth, but unwatchable.

Fuck off troll cunt.
thanks for wasting my bandwitch

sincerely
F. U. Bitch"
,xandao2,2013-05-17T05:09Z,"Is not HD, is telesynk.... Thanks great job!"
,lilbehr,2013-05-19T02:18Z,"@ PPandora  Love your comment ! Your right, no one should be complaining about something that is free. The uploader has taken his time to give us the entertainment we seek. We all should be more appreciative of his time and hard work !   "
,lilbehr,2013-05-19T02:39Z,"@dididie and @clawdigga If it's better quality you seek, then why are you downloading a Cam version and not waiting an extra week or so for a higher quality version ?  You didn't have to pay even a penny out of your pocket yet here you are complaining, and to top it off you seem to feel the need to express yourself by using foul language and calling names. If it's attention you seek, I suggest you go elsewhere !"
,zoggnoff,2013-05-19T17:57Z,"The screens are all cherry picked. Whenever there's action it's pixelated, litteraly square boxes of color and the sound is like a dewalt boombox radio. For a cam it's B+ anything else a D-"
,bigbullzi,2013-05-20T07:48Z,"R6 really? You upload a poor cam and call it R6?
Sure I'll go somewhere else gladly."
,SkallaEnSvan,2013-05-20T07:54Z,"Just download this 720 rip and http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8473186/Iron_Man_2013_R6_LINE_Xvid_NEW_AUDIO_READ_NFO_UnKnOwN then just mute the 720p rip and start the new audio one at the same time with some player.. I use VLC, and voila u got urself a decent movie."
,diogofb,2013-05-23T22:41Z,"Podre, não é R6, é CAM, como tem gente que coloca esse lixo!"
,begooz,2013-05-30T02:28Z,oh hi.... u 4got to say ITS DAMN JAPANESE ALL OVER IT!!!
