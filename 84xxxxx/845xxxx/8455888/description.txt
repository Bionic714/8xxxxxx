Experience a new story that spans 20 years with Command & Conquer 3: Kane's
Wrath. From the rebirth of the Brotherhood of Nod after the Second Tiberium
War through the dramatic events of the Third Tiberium War and beyond.
Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is told through a new set of high-
definition live action video sequences starring a celebrity cast. Joe Kucan,
the original actor who portrayed the character Kane in Command & Conquer
games over the last decade, will reprise his role as the megalomaniacal
leader of the Brotherhood of Nod.

Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath also features a new strategic layer of
gameplay that allows you to establish bases, build customised armies, and
attack your enemies on a global scale - and then dive into the frenzied
tactical combat where your skills as a commander will be tested to the
limits. Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath introduces six new sub-factions
and a wealth of new units, structures, and powers to the armies of the
Global Defense Initiative, the Brotherhood of Nod, and the enigmatic alien
Scrin.
