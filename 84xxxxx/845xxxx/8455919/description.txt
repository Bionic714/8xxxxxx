Overview:
Wreak havoc in in the open-world of Retro City Rampage! YouΓÇÖll meet a variety of very familiar characters, including a certain time-travelling scientist, engage in various modes of gameplay such as stealth, platforming, early coin-ops, and even encounter radioactive plumbers who await with eager anticipation their chance to murder and masticate you, The Player! But, wait, thereΓÇÖs more! Stomp on hapless pedestrians like they are Goombas and claim your coin. While you are taking the world by storm, youΓÇÖll encounter a few guest stars such as Super Meat Boy, Splosion Man and Ms. Splosion, and BIT.TRIP Runner. Last but not least, youΓÇÖll be able to tear through Minecraft for even more crossover goodness!

You are out on a lovely jaunt of CRIME CAPERS when you were ambushed by the EVIL GOOD GUYS, who will stop at nothing to end your RAMPAGE OF DOOM throughout Theftropolis City. Retro City Rampage is a parodic paean to old-school gaming and the culture of the 80ΓÇÖs, referencing many classic game experiences while providing modern-day open-world mechanics, all wrapped in glorious 8-bit graphical goodness.
