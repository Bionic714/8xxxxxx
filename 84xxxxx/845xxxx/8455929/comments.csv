[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-25T22:58Z,"What are you sayin' ?  He said in post title that they're 24 bit ( that's lossless...equal to CD quality sound ) and from Vinyl, so these files are taken from records and not CDs.

It could be argued that they're not lossless because vinyl records aren't as high in quality as CDs but we'll just have to listen and judge for ourselves. It's a slow torrent though. Probably not worth the long wait, since it's faster to get each album individually from one-album torrents."
[V],politux,2013-05-30T17:47Z,"Actually, you're confused.  

CD's are limited to 16 bit / 44,100 Hz

However a properly ripped vinyl is 24 bit / 96,000 Hz which is much higher quality with about 3x the bit rate. :)"
