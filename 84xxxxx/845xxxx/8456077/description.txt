Take a trip down memory lane with this collection of 80s era music videos and MTV commercial bumpers that originally aired on MTV back when MTV actually meant "music television".  In this collection you will find 250 of the most iconic 80s videos that ever aired on MTV as well as 30+ MTV commercial bumpers, station idents, and comedy shorts.  Many of these bumpers will be instantly recognizable to those who tuned in to American MTV during the 80s and 90s.

About this collection...

The Videos:  All of the 250 videos in this collection are AVI and good to excellent quality.  Only about five of the 250 videos have logos.  I tried to include only the U.S. version of each video, but if the quality of the U.K. or international version was superior, I selected those instead.  I also included a small number of videos that didn't play on American MTV due to being banned or uncensored.

Some of these videos I've already uploaded in past artist collections.  If you are wondering whether or not you should download this entire pack or just pick and choose the ones you need, I recommend downloading the entire pack.  The quality of the videos in this collection is better, for the most part.    

The Commercial Bumpers:  The MTV bumpers, idents, and shorts in this collection encompass the years from 1981-1999.  I was unable to determine the exact year each of the bumpers originally aired, so I just included all of them.  The source for these bumpers was a combination of DVD and VHS, so the quality varies.  

After this collection of videos is well-seeded and I find a little extra time, I will upload a second collection of music videos focusing on the 90s.  So if you want to see that torrent anytime soon, please help seed this one.
