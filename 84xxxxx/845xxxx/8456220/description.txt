*Almost* complete collection of the Blue Beetle comic series. The following issues are missing from Volume 1:

(issue 43 was skipped, it never existed)
#45
#47
#48
#49

I couldn't track down scans of these issues, if someone could hook me up I'd be grateful.

I did the volume division according to Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Beetle

As always, I don't take credit for anything. Please seed for the enjoyment of all!
