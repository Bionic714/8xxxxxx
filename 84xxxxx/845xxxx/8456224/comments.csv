Exactly. 

But hey if that other person wants to not have any patience, not wait 6 hours or so for an official release, not wait a couple more hours for a xvid release so they didn't have to use their own bandwidth, wants to give out lesser quality versions and go over their data cap every month - so be it.  You can't fix stupid. I tried again and again.
