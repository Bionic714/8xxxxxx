,Logman115,2013-05-11T05:38Z,"Good rip. Haven't seen anything missing as of yet, audio and video are rather good, but the audio is about half a second out of sync (fixable in VLC and I'm sure other things, delay the audio a bit), and there appear to be chinese(?) subtitles on the text, but not the audio. Overall, acceptable as a rip and much better than a cam."
,Logman115,2013-05-11T05:59Z,"...oh, look, there's a bit where the audio in in chinese. And there are no subtitles. Also the occasional watermark. ...it's /still/ more watchable than the cam, though."
,Logman115,2013-05-11T08:45Z,"Funfact: The scenes that are in chinese are cut from the other versions of the movie. So even if you don't understand them, you still get more than watching the cam version. And now I'm done spamming this."
