[T],data9724,2013-05-17T08:13Z,"Err, there are only 3 Eagles of Rome albums made so far, and all 3 are out as scanlations already."
,Zippetta,2013-05-19T02:11Z,"Really? The way the third book ended made it look like there was more to come. Big thanks for those 3 albums by the way.

These ""Guilty Pleasures"" are also great, very funny."
[T],data9724,2013-05-19T10:28Z,"There might be more, last one was from 2011, not uncommon from euro books to be a few years between releases.
Can recommend always checking Bedetheque, a good source for info on french books :)
