And here you go, the second book in the Guilty Pleasures series, scanned and edited by me, and translated and retexted by Alice.

Guilty Pleasures is short 1-2 page gags about our hero, Arthur, and his various sexual escapades, or the lack thereof :).
In this second book, we are introduced to Clara, the female counterpart to Arthur.

The art style is cute and funny, but it IS adult in nature, so dont give this to your kids :)
