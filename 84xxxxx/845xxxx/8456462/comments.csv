Any chance of upping Bravest Warriors #7 & #8?  My daughters' favorite book...that I will let them read.  Wish they had noses though..."
,Nightwing1945,2013-05-09T18:18Z,...I guess I should qualify that statement:  I wish the comic book characters had noses; my daughters all have fully functioning noses.  LOL.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T18:29Z,"#7 was posted in this one: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8381799/

and i think i saw #8 yesterday, should be able to grab it..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T18:30Z,"and much like iron man, would it be the same with a nose?"
,Nightwing1945,2013-05-09T18:47Z,"Good point, the lack of noses maybe adds ""something"" possibly.  I have the #7, just was thinking if someone down the line is searching for Bravest Warriors, to bundle up #7 and 8 would be a service.  Thanks STF.

Also, has anyone seen a scan for Ghostface Killah's 12 Reasons to Die #1 yet?  I'd like to at least check out the first issue.....oooh, oooh, and Uber #1 too, if I haven't annoyed you thoroughly enough yet."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T19:48Z,"here's #8  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8456929/

well maybe since #8 is the conclusion of a storyline, some nice soul will torrent 1-8 together!

and in bravest warriors world, how do they even know if there's a natural gas leak?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-09T19:54Z,i see no sign of those other 2 books... yet.
