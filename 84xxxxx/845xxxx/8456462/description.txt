Spinning right out of the stories collected in Dark Horse Presents, X, the brutal masked vigilante of the 90ΓÇ▓s returns with bloody force as he brings his brand of justice to the city of Arcadia, which is rife with corrupt businessmen and criminals. Brought to you by the exciting team of Duane Swierczynski and Eric Nguyen, X has a wide reach of appeal for fans who love a nouveau pulp yarn mixed with bloody, bare knuckle action in a seedy city whose underbelly is a place of enjoyment for the reader.

After killing Leo Pietrain, a man thought unkillable due to his well designed ΓÇ£panic roomΓÇ¥, X is on the lookout for his next target. But when the police spring a trap for him, his life may be in the hands of a young woman, a former journalist, on the trail of the one man who caused so much bloody death at a local warehouse. Will X retain his secret identity, or will Leigh Ferguson get her muckraking news story for her web blog?
