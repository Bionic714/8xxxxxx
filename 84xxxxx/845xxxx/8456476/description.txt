Alive and Kickin' Ass
Expanded Live Sky (Remix) album by Crack the Sky

Released 	2006
Recorded 	1978
Genre 		Rock
Label 		Lifesong
Producer 	Joe Macre

Alive and Kickin' Ass is the fifth live album released by Crack the Sky. 
Recorded live at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the 
Agora in Cleveland, Ohio in 1978, the same shows that were used for the 
Live Sky album. Four of these performances were previously unreleased and 
six were on Live Sky (one of those six, "She's a Dancer", was edited for 
length on Live Sky but appears here in its entirety); the tapes were 
completely remixed and remastered by bassist Joe Macre for this release.

TLSCU note:
Deleted track Maybe I Can Fool Everybody (Tonight) was added back to this 
recording from the bonus Live Sky tracks from the 1988 Live WBAB as it was 
able to fit the time needed to burn this expanded album to a single CD with 
11 tracks. Some small volume adjustments were needed for this track to match
the 2006 remixes volume.
