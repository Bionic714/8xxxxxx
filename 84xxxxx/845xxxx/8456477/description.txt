This miniseries is shipping 4 times this month, as 258.1 to 258.4

This is like the X-Men Forever series, with the old writer returning to tell a story picking up right after he left the book. In this case, 1990 or so.

It's disappointing that Layton's only inking this, but the 1st issue was still very good. --STFmaryville
