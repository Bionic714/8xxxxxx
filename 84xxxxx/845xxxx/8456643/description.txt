Danny, Spikes and Silk have just recently graduated from high school in New York. Danny finds a title deed for a huge house in a small town. He has a dream to turn it into a Rock n' Roll hotel. The townspeople though are not very welcome to the New Yorkers. With a little help from an aging stockbroker, a local girl, and the "stockholders" (friends from New York), they are able to help Danny pursue his dream.
