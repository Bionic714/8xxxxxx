Falkar.Falcons.2002.DVDRip.XviD-TiG


Simon, who has taken too many punches from this world and has done too much time in U.S. prisons, returns to his ancestral homeland, Iceland, resigned to do himself in. Before he can complete the task, he meets Dúa, a free spirit he believes may well be his daughter.

Simon rescues Dúa from a close scrape with the law and together they escape to Hamburg, smuggling an Icelandic falcon - once the most prized export of the Vikings. Their plan is to sell it to a wealthy Arab. A great idea - until they try it.

Fridrik Thor Fridriksson delivers a subtle and poetic film in the league of his own classics "Movie Days", "Cold Fever" and "Devil's Island". Seemingly as remote as the Icelandic setting, charismatic connoisseur actor Keith Carradine is in command of every scene and lends his character a calm but powerful presence.
