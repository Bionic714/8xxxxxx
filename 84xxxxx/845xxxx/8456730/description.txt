ItΓÇÖs hard to believe that The Weepies havenΓÇÖt yet appeared on Yo Gabba Gabba! The Los Angeles husband-and-wife duo of Deb Talan and Steve Tannen have always made kid-friendly musicΓÇöthe kind of record you buy because you enjoy it, but before you know it, the kids are singing along in the backseatΓÇöbut their latest record is the first theyΓÇÖve written as parents, and it shows.

Talan and Tannen havenΓÇÖt always been this chipper; they wrote much of their last record when they desperately wanted to have a baby, and the songs were shaded by loneliness and longing. It was called Hideaway, named after a song about how even the stars sometimes canΓÇÖt bear to emerge. They finally became parents between the time they made Hideaway and released it, so even though their world had changed, they spent the last few years performing songs theyΓÇÖd written a lifetime ago. The new mom and dad were probably happier than their music soundedΓÇöand all that contained joy had to explode at some pointΓÇöwhich brings us to Be My Thrill.

First track ΓÇ£Please Speak Well Of MeΓÇ¥ is just what youΓÇÖd expect from a band called The WeepiesΓÇöa simple waltz with wistful lyrics clearly enunciated by TalanΓÇÖs sugary voiceΓÇöand would have fit nicely on their breakout record Say I Am You. Next, though, comes the first of three songs about sunshine. The sing-songy ΓÇ£When You Go AwayΓÇ¥ kicks off a portion of the record that should come preloaded on minivan stereo systems: ΓÇ£When you go away / ItΓÇÖs like you hide the sun / ΓÇª When you go away / ItΓÇÖs an unfinished song,ΓÇ¥ Talan sings. ΓÇ£I Was Made For Sunny DaysΓÇ¥ is exuberant, a modern-day ΓÇ£You Are My SunshineΓÇ¥ (ΓÇ£I was made for sunny days / I made do with gray, but I didnΓÇÖt stay / I was made for sunny days / And I was made for youΓÇ¥). And between the handclaps and lyrics like ΓÇ£We hold hands while we work and play / And hope tomorrow is a sunny day,ΓÇ¥ the ridiculously catchy ΓÇ£Hope TomorrowΓÇ¥ could be the theme song to a PBS Kids show.

ΓÇ£HummingbirdΓÇ¥ is a lullaby, with hushed vocals and tender words; despite its name, so is ΓÇ£Not a Lullaby,ΓÇ¥ with all the key rock-a-bye-baby qualitiesΓÇörepetitive, reassuring, self-referential lyrics about holding someone when the rain falls. Even on the ostensibly grown-up songs, The WeepiesΓÇÖ lyrics seem to have originated from late nights spent soothing their progeny, especially the repetition throughout the otherwise mellow ΓÇ£Red, Red RoseΓÇ¥ (ΓÇ£You donΓÇÖt know why you do the things you do, do, do / YouΓÇÖre holding it together with some glue, glue, glueΓÇ¥).

The Weepies arenΓÇÖt for everyone. Be My Thrill is sweetΓÇöreally sweetΓÇöand thereΓÇÖs very little sour to balance it out. But Talan and Tannen are disarmingly unapologetic: TheyΓÇÖre in love with each other, they have an adorable little boy, the weatherΓÇÖs amazing in California, life is beautiful and they write mushy-gushy pop songs about it.

Even in that context, the album delivers some surprises. On the bluesy rocker ΓÇ£How Do You Get High?ΓÇ¥ Tannen takes the lead, asking the title question at least 11 times, while Talan sings sultry harmonies over electric guitars in the background. ItΓÇÖs a great song, and Be My ThrillΓÇÿs only bit of muscle, but itΓÇÖs disorienting in context. ΓÇ£Add My EffortΓÇ¥ is just a little Auto-tune and a sax solo away from airplay on Delilah, in the best way possibleΓÇöitΓÇÖs unabashed, moody soft-pop. Though the lyrics are a little awkward (ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm gonna add my effort to youΓÇ¥ΓÇöhuh?), TalanΓÇÖs background vocals have never sounded better, almost taking the place of a guitar part. And ΓÇ£TheyΓÇÖre In Love, Where Am I?ΓÇ¥ sounds like a Burt Bacharach cover; the language is intentionally dated (Talan chirps about LoverΓÇÖs Lane and kissing in the rain, while the vibraphone rings and dings along) and itΓÇÖs charmingΓÇöjust slightly out of character.

The Weepies close their record in the minor keys. ΓÇ£Empty Your HandsΓÇ¥ is about letting go of the worldΓÇÖs problems and releasing them like a bunch of red balloons into a blue skyΓÇötooth-achingly sweet, but a picture we could probably all stand to imagine. ItΓÇÖs a perfect way for the duo to sign off; it somehow justifies their cheeriness, as if theyΓÇÖre saying, ΓÇ£This is why we make music.ΓÇ¥ The songΓÇÖs inspiration? ΓÇ£Our baby learned to run today / in circles on the grass / His joyful face it radiates / These moments go so fast,ΓÇ¥ Talan sings. Parenthood can really change your perspective. Your music, too.
