[T],theburningbush,2013-05-09T20:36Z,"ziggyff: If history is a guide, then this torrent will *never* get past 0.

And the only alternative as of now, Craig.Ferguson.2013.05.08.Lauren.Graham.HDTV.XviD-AFG, will probably have increasing OOS problems as do most 800+MB AFG releases. I'm DLing it anyway, but without much hope."
[T],theburningbush,2013-05-09T22:44Z,"Yep, just got the 800+MB AFG, and as per usual, it begins in sync and increasingly goes way out of sync.

And, as per usual, the 720p version is stuck on 0.000 availability.

Sorry (not really) to sound so negative, but when one can predict exactly what the 720p and 800+MB versions are going to be -- as I did -- it's difficult to not be pessimistic."
