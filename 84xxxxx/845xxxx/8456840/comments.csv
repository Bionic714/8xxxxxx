This is obviousely a different cam rip the minute you watch it. It is not the same video source that has been in all the dozens up dozens of re-releases since april.

It is not full english audio in that in some parts it switches to a foreign language especially within the first five minutes while a character is talking then its back to english audio. 

But other then that minor issue who cares at least now it's a different audio source from what I can tell and NOT something that's been recleaned/enhanced like other releases. You can actually UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING NOW! :D"

I'm re-rating this based on the fact that the longer I watched this you can tell the audio is not synched up to lip movements and for me it's extremely annoying to try and watch a movie and notice audio not synched up to lip movement."
