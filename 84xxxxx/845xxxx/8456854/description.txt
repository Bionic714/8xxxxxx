Welcome to Strange Hill High, an all-but forgotten inner-city
school where extraordinary is normal.

Mitchell Tanner is the new kid at school. His mum is a single
parent and he is really hoping for an ordinary life and to not
get in any trouble after a couple of false starts... the only
problem is, Strange Hill High is far from normal, and 'ordinary'
is definitely not on the cards!

Teaming up with over-confident under-achiever Becky Butters and
class nerd Templeton, the three intrepid 13-year olds set out
to investigate the strange, mysterious, and often other-worldly
occurrences at their school.

With a plethora of secrets and mysteries, the show follows the
trio as they explore the bizarre high school, investigating the
peculiar occurrences that seem to only happen at Strange Hill
High - and always with absurd and outrageous results!

Created for CBBC using an all new innovative production technique
combining puppets, Japanese vinyl toys and digital effects, Strange
Hill High combines everyday classroom antics with fantastical and
mysterious goings on.

In episode one, a very strange thing happens at Strange Hill High ΓÇô
Mitchell actually completes an assignment! HeΓÇÖs made a beautiful
wooden skateboard for his woodworking project, but when school
bully Tyson smashes the lavatory walls with it, bizarre things
start happening.

Behind the walls Mitchell, Becky and Templeton discover an ancient
lavatory, seemingly from Arthurian times, guarded by a vigilant
statue of a knights guard. Things go from bad to worse when the
statue, Sir Bogivere, comes to life and declares Mitchell King.
With Mitchell deciding to take full advantage of being crowned
ruler of Strange Hill High, will the school ever be the same again?
