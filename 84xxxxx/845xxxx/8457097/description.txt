A.R.Rahman does mainly movies and if we think of albums then Vande Mataram and Connections come to our mind. But there are a number of songs that were not a part of any movie or album but were released as singles. Also there have been albums of which A.R.Rahman was part of but did not compose the complete the album instead he had one or two songs. I have compiled such songs in this upload. Hope everyone enjoys them.
