,stalkersrage,2013-05-09T23:36Z,"an R6 would be dvd quality with Russian audio. Or, DVD quality with Russian audio removed and replaced with English CAM or LINE audio. This is just a CAM. 

Watchable, maybe. But bad quality overall.

V: 6 (dark in spots)
A: 3 (tinny and hollow)

Thanks, but no thanks. "
