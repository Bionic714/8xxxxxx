
From the creators of your favorite live wallpapers, spend a relaxing summer day at your own private beach - everytime you use your device.

Relax in the shade while waves froth at the shore of your very own stretch of secluded beach. Clouds float past a quaint lighthouse in the distance, and a boat gently rocks in the shallows. An airplane with your message drifts through the idylic scene.

Choose the sign message on the beach, or hide the sign altogether - it's all up to you! Watch closely, and you may even see a shark!

Customize every part of the scene, including the waves, sharks, aircraft, signs, umbrella, and more - thousands of possible combinations! You can also hide or show the items in the scene to create your own beach. Or, select one of the preset themes and choose from the 'Private Beach', 'Fireworks at Night', 'Family Outing', 'Independence Day', or 'Shark Sighting' themes.
