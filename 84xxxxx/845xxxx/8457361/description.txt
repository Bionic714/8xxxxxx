Step into this epic point-and-click mythical adventure game. See what it takes to be the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses)! Get ready to embark on a journey filled with danger, mythical creatures and ancient Gods. Thrilling moments and unexpected twists as well as the evil presence of legendary creatures dominate this mythical game throughout.

You will have to step into the shoes of Odysseus (Ulysses) and his journey home after the fall of Troy. It took him ten years to reach Ithaca after the ten- year Trojan War. Become a part of Homer's original myth, live the adventure, and educate yourself during the process.

Beware; this is not a simple task. You will have to escape from Goddess Calypso's island, blind Cyclops Polyphemus, face the witch-Goddess Circe, go to the land of the death in search of an oracle, avoid the Siren mermaids, pass between the six-headed monster Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis, and visit the Sun God's island. Finally, you will have to murder the suitors and get together with your beloved wife, Penelope and your fearless son Telemachus.
