,dbranson17,2013-05-10T01:15Z,why would you remove the advertising?  Isn't enough you didn't pay for the books?
,Maharsi,2013-05-10T02:08Z,@Dbranson: someone had put incorrectly sized personal ads at the beginning. The advertisements included in the normal comics are all still there.

,Pheav,2013-05-10T12:40Z,Issues 4 and 6 show an archive broken error too
,CudMan,2013-05-10T19:33Z,"Confirm archives are corrupt, JPGs are not complete. How is it possible to fail so much?"
,Zythros,2013-05-12T03:52Z,Damn I was going to download because I love Serenity but then I saw it had corrupted files.. damn 
,Maharsi,2013-05-24T03:02Z,"Fuck me, right?
Making a zip archive of them all right now. Read that makes them stop epic failing."
,Maharsi,2013-05-24T03:15Z,Fixing it now.. Will have a non-fail version up in a sec here.
