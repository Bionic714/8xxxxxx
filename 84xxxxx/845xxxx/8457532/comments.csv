,OMEGACOMP,2013-05-10T03:56Z,"Welp its not fake, scanned with all the appropriate Virus scans, eg. Avast, AVG, blah blah. Its clean.

As for quality, Its a CAM copy, the quality of the cam FOR a cam is 7V 8A FOR a cam. Its a little dark, and a tiny bit shakey on occasion. Watchable. For a Cam you'd be hard pressed to get better. "
,Shalacknar,2013-05-10T03:58Z,Thank you OMEGA
,Shalacknar,2013-05-10T04:02Z,
,Valmordius,2013-05-11T11:01Z,for a cam the quality is 1/2 decent BUT it skips alot of scenes making it hard for someone to follow if they havent already seen the movie
,Frane777,2013-05-11T13:34Z,is this original film??
,Twizted1,2013-05-21T20:24Z,"This is a ""decent"" copy.

A: 6
V: 5 1/2

Of course, with a CAM, you WILL have a few dark
scenes that are DARK. LOL.

Thx for the UL. Very watchable if you can't wait."
,Calamakuya,2013-05-22T20:17Z,"Due to the fact that my sight is steadily getting worse by the day, I abhor dark scenes that get even darker in some CAM... Therefore I have no other option than to get depressed and wait for a better copy to appear b4 I get totally blind."
