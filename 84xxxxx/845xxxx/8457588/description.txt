Next up FCUP is 'Crossroads'. Wikipedia, him say:

Crossroads was a five-issue limited series published in 1988 by First Comics.

Crossroads made use of various First Comics published characters, including Sable, Badger, Grimjack, Dreadstar, and Nexus. The stories, written by Steven Grant, Mike Baron, and Roger Salick, were intertwined, although featuring different characters in each issue. Artists included Cynthia Martin, Joe Staton, Shawn McManus, and Luke McDonnell. The covers for each issue were supplied by Steve Rude.
