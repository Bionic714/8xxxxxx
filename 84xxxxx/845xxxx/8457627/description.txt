[b]Alyssia[/b] is UK based pop singer with a beautiful voice who initiated her career in India. She is the same [b]Vibha Sharma[/b] who sang the extremely popular song [i]Mehndi Lagaungi Main[/i][b][/b] in her debut album [b]Mehandi[/b] in the year 2000. Her song was one of the last hits of Indian Pop Music as after 2000 pop music in India became virtually non existent.


Recently I came to know that she is still singing but now is based in London and has taken up a new name, Alyssia. The songs that I have uploaded are from her album named [b]ALYSSIA[/b]. I hope every one enjoys them as much as I did when I heard them first.
