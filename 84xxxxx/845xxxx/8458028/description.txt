Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, May 9 transmission of The Alex Jones Show, Alex continues to seek the truth behind the Benghazi debacle that left four Americans dead in Libya Sept 11, 2012, which the White House falsely claimed was fallout stemmed from an anti-Islamic YouTube video. 

Accompanied by guests Lord Christopher Monckton and author and psychological warfare expert Dr. Steve Pieczenik, Alex also analyzes Israel's and the US' increased efforts to invade Syria by funding, aiding and arming so-called rebels, many of which are affiliated with the al-Qaeda offshoot Jabhat al-Nusra. 

Alex also welcomes Member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) Godfrey William Bloom to discuss the party's strong showing in the local elections. 

Defense Distributed's Cody Wilson also pops in to speak about his group's development of the first fully 3D printed gun, the Liberator.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
