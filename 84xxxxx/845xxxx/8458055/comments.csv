The movie is not good at all.. i stopped watching half way.. "
,halfchaos,2013-05-12T07:44Z,"if the movie sucks then why are people seeding it? Between shitty movies and games being top seeded while the founders sell out and push out popups, I'm about to say fuck it and just delete my bookmark and go to kickass instead. FUCK YOU PIRATEBAY."
,safta420,2013-05-12T18:53Z,"@halfchaos, use Firefox and Adblock Plus. No more popups or ads. You might also want to note that most torrents at KAT are just links from here."
,hevehitta,2013-05-12T21:53Z,@halfchaos I have not seen a single ad or popup on the bay in years.  A plain white web page with a list of links.  Do what @safta420 said and update your AdBlock preferences before you start yelling about shit you know not of.
,fattyz12,2013-05-13T00:25Z,Oh shit!  Thanks SO much for that reference to adblock I had totally forgotten about it so nice to be rid of all the PORNO ads all over this site THANKS!
,SirMarkALot,2013-05-13T04:59Z,"News flash to all you rookies out there...It costs money to operate a website!!! You are getting FREE DOWNLOADS!! What are you complaining about a couple banner ads? Are you donating to keep this site alive? Many don't. In order to get some revenue, TPB allows advertisements. When you have your own website, you can operate it however you like. Please be respectful for the people who are giving you everything, yet you give them nothing but petty griping."
,Jack_Reacher,2013-05-14T15:39Z,"@SirMarkALot ... kudos, bro.  Well said.

And thanks, juggs!"
