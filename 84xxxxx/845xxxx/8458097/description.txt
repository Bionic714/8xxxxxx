Book 0.5: The Weird Girls (Weird Girls 0.5) by Cecy Robson (December 4th 2012)

Celia Wird and her three sisters are just like other 20-something girlsΓÇöwith one tiny exception: they're products of a backfired curse that has given each of them unique powers that make them, well, a little weirdΓÇª 

The Wird sisters are different from every race on earthΓÇöhuman and supernatural. When human society is no longer an option for them, they move in among the resident vampires, werebeasts, and witches of the Lake Tahoe region. Could this be the true home theyΓÇÖve longed for? Um, not quite. After the sisters accidentally strip a witch of her powers in a bar brawl, they soon realize the mistake will cost them. Because to take on a witch means to take on her coven. And losing the battle isnΓÇÖt an option.

Includes a preview of the first full-length novel in the Weird Girls series, Sealed with a CurseΓÇöas well as introductions to the Weird World, and a letter from the author.

Book 1: Sealed with a Curse (Weird Girls #1) by Cecy Robson (December 31st 2012)

Celia Wird and her three sisters are just like other twenty-something girlsΓÇöwith one tiny exception: They're the products of a curse that backfired and gave each of them unique powers that make them, well, a little weirdΓÇª

The Wird sisters are content to avoid the local vampires, werebeasts, and witches of the Lake Tahoe regionΓÇöuntil one of them blows up a vampire in self-defense. Everyone knows vampires aren't aggressive, and killing one is punishable by death. But soon more bloodlust-fueled attacks occur, and the community wonders if the vampires of Tahoe are plague-ridden.

Celia reluctantly agrees to help Misha, the handsome leader of an infected vampire family. But Aric, the head of the werewolf pack determined to destroy Misha's family to keep the area safe, warns Celia to stay out of the fight. Caught between two hot alphas, Celia must find a way to please everyone, save everyone, andΓÇöoh, yeahΓÇönot lose her heart to the wrong guy or die a miserable death. Because now that the evil behind the plague knows who Celia is, he's coming for her and her sisters. 

This Wird girl has never had it so tough.
