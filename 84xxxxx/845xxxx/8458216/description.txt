The British satirical magazine ΓÇ£Private EyeΓÇ¥ was founded in October 1961. In this programme, Michael Crick looks at the magazineΓÇÖs roots in the English public school Shrewsbury School and later at Oxford. The programme is something of a paean of praise rather than an objective assessment of how Private Eye manages to survive in the digital age, but nonetheless is of interest in seeing how the magazine came about.
