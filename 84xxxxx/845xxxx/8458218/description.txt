Earlier this week, the United States government forced Defense Distributed, the creator of a fully 3D printable firearm, to pull the plans for its first printable weapon, The Liberator, from their site. In response, many of us are torrenting the plans in the hopes that this information gets into the hands of as many people as possible. This torrent file contains the plans that can be run on almost any capable 3D printer to create an actual firearm. PLEASE RESEED!
