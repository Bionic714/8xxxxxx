

Teach Yourself/Linguaphone Cantonese (1976) with pdf and audio


Notes:

1. This is a Cantonese course produced by Teach Yourself (not a grammar/translation book) and Linguaphone (not a typical Linguaphone course).

2. The course contains sound drills, dialogs, "pattern drills" (not recorded).

3. I did not split the audio files (about 48 mins. of audio).

4. Twenty lessons in 270 pages.
