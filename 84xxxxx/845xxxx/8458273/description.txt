Test your memory, imagination, math skills, powers of observation and deductive reasoning, and other mental talents by becoming a detective, a magician, an architect, and a creative thinker. Play with dominoes, unscramble letters, uncover inconsistencies, and solve mysteries. Plenty of amusing illustrations add to the fun.
