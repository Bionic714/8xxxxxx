
Retro action takes over your home screen! Galaga, Space Invaders, Atlantis -- it might be a lost genre but we can still celebrate it. Tap on enemy ships to destroy them, tap on the screen to fire the hero ship's weapons! Touch the hero ship itself to fire the monstrous Super Laser!

This full version has a full settings screen! Set preferences for visual theme, weapon types, weapon randomization, camera behavior, score display, and more!

Works as either a live wallpaper or a Daydream!

What's in this version:
v1.3:
- New Feature: Retro 3D art set!
- Bug Fix: Fixed resizing issue on some handsets
