 : It is 1975, a perfect spring in Istanbul. Kemal and Sibel, children of two :
 : prominent families, are about to become engaged. But when Kemal encounters :
 : Füsun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation, he becomes enthralled. :
 : And once they violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between :
 : Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeoisie. In his pursuit:
 : of Füsun over the next eight years, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of:
 : objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress--amassing a museum that is    :
 : both a map of a society and of his heart. Orhan Pamuk's first novel since  :
 : winning the Nobel Prize is a stirring exploration of the nature of romance.:
