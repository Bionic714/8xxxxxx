,ogstankyfluff,2013-05-10T05:50Z,"really weird but i kept refreshing until i saw an upload, they all showed up for ""me"" 30 minutes or so after they were uploaded. i clicked download right away and it was saved as ""file"" no mp4. it suspiciously finished downloading randomly after i saw it at 20 percent. now i deleted and redownloading and now it says mp4. same download link too. this has happened to me twice. a system bug maybe?"
