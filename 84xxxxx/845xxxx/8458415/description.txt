Twenty years ago they were good buddies but horrors have changed them both. Lindsay lost her entire family except for her niece in a car accident, and Jack was held captive in New YorkΓÇÖs underbelly for nearly two years by demented sub-humans. It was a soul-sucking experience thatΓÇÖs left him a shell of a man. He refuses to descend into that hell again, especially for a girl whoΓÇÖs probably dead anyway. But when Lindsay is nearly killed there after going it alone, Jack feels compelled to save her skin.
