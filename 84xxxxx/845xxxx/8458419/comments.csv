,zipomatic,2013-05-11T21:26Z,"No fix that I am aware of. I played all files, skipped to the middle and end to make sure the played... they worked fine for me.

No idea what is up, sorry mate."
,shogunrza,2013-05-12T15:08Z,"Hey Zip, it is the middle 2 again. Can you try uploading the middle two separate? 

Thanks for your work"
,zipomatic,2013-05-12T17:51Z,"Unfortunately, I had a bit of a PC snafu last night and I no longer have the files... but next time, I will upload just THREE files and see what happens. Maybe they will all up fine, or if it is just the middle one... maybe there is a pattern. Weird thing is, I am assuming that all of the other files I have uploaded work fine as nobody has said anything about it. "
,zipomatic,2013-05-12T18:13Z,"Okay guys, I have figured out what the problem was... stay with me on this, because I don't know why this happened.

I test the files to upload (stored in folder 1) and the work fine. Then I drag them over to my upload folder (folder 2) and upload them.

Somehow (and I don't know how) DRAGGING the files from folder 1 to folder 2 was corrupting them and making them not play (when I tried to play the files that worked SECONDS AGO in folder 2, they were now broken)

But if I copy and paste the files from folder 1 to folder 2, they transfer no problem at all.

Any ideas what the heck is going on with that?
Guess my backup HD is failing...

Here is bundle 11 and it should be working 100%

I will try and re-up the broken files from before in a special pack.

Again, apologies for the corrupt files, that was really weird."
