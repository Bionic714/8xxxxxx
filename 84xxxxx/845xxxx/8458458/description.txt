"Melbourne-based Beaches received acclaim at home when their self-titled 2008 debut was shortlisted for OzΓÇÖs prestigious Australian Music Prize-- rubbing shoulders with Oceania indie rock A-listers like Cut Copy, the Presets and the Drones-- and got included in the 2010 compendium/compilation 100 Best Australian Albums to boot. Beaches was born out of casual jam sessions between friends who were between bands and never really thought theyΓÇÖd get any attention with the project. Their songs are simultaneously dense and amorphous, and often named for opaquely vast signifiers-- their 2008 debut included cryptic monoliths ΓÇ£HorizonΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Eternal SphereΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£VikingsΓÇ¥-- and the music follows suit.
