Please disregard the info displayed on the individual tracks, and go with what I have provided here.

This is from a 10 CD set published by a company that if I remember correctly is called "House of Jazz".

Their track listings are goofy.

I can't re-rip it and make corrections that way, as I took advantage of the store's return policy (for the benefit of the next person who comes in and may want to purchase the Coleman Hawkins 10 CD set  without the cellophane wrapper obscuring it's contents, yes I am at peace with this decision and I feel it is probably not too much to ask of you, the downloader, to be tolerant).

Some of the CD's had god awful reverb added and the whole thing was pretty shoddily put together, but this one sounds passable, and I am thus offering it up for your edification and amusement.

Please enjoy, and for godness sakes, you might thank me for a goddamned change!!! (if you feel like it)

Also please check out the Art Tatum Group Masterpieces which I didn't upload, but all I can say about them is "where have you been all my life my true love, I will listen to you and care for you and back you up and seed you..." etc.
