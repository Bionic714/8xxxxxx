,FSXler,2013-05-10T11:57Z,"Hello!

can anybody tell me how to delete the Airbus  COMPLETELY without deninstaller?

inclusive ALL registry entries etc.

my Problem, since Version 1.03 I got no ILS Localizer Dot on PFD and Deviation bar on ND anymore... actually, ILS ist working but not displaying. I guess  a Major Problem/failure has happend during deinstalling/updating to another version.

before V1.10 I had Version 1.04, but this time the dinstaller reported an error so that I had to delete the Bus manually, but with Version 1.10 the old failure lasts....

cheers 
Marc"

,xnolunchx,2013-05-10T20:33Z,"FSXler, sounds like you might want to re-install FSX all together and then run something like CCcleaner to get rid of all the unused registry entries. "
