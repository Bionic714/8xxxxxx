                    Coyote Clean Up ΓÇô 2 Hot 2 Wait (2013)


Coyote Clean Up is another alias of Detroit house usurper Ice Cold Chrissy, a DJ/producer with a distinct, lo-fi-meets-high-tech style. CCU is bringing the aptly titled 2 HOT 2 WAIT, which comes to us via Los Angeles' DIY dance imprint 100% Silk.

According to the artist himself, the LP is all about duality: "Blistering heat on a sun bleach beach and ice cold pitch black nights in a frozen city. Lonely bedroom dreaming and muggy packed dance floors. Pedal to the metal on the interstate and back road riding dirty. Head in future clouds and heart in the nostalgic past." 

Even as Coyote Clean Up's sound has evolved, the quality, accessibility and availability of his music has remained pretty consistent, qualities that make it a great gateway for newcomers and longtime fans.
