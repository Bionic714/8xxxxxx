This is *not* the 5-hour second quartet! Speaking of which, someone should
upload that piece.

MD5 sums for all included files (check these if you suspect a corrupt torrent):

Please note: Because of the MPAA/RIAA's pathetic new campaign to make ISPs their 
flunkies, I am now *requiring* full stream encryption for all BitTorrent connections.
If you aren't encrypted, I can't upload to you; upgrade to a modern client!
