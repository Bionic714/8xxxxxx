Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in October 2000 by the Parlophone label. A commercial success worldwide,[1] Kid A went platinum in its first week of release in the United Kingdom.[2] Despite the lack of an official single or music video as publicity, Kid A became the first Radiohead release to debut at number one in the United States.[3] This success was credited variously to a unique marketing campaign, the early Internet leak of the album,[4] and anticipation after the band's acclaimed 1997 album OK Computer.[5]

Kid A was recorded in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and Oxford with producer Nigel Godrich. The album's songwriting and recording were experimental for Radiohead,[6] as the band replaced their earlier "anthemic" rock style with a more electronic sound.[7] Influenced by Krautrock,[8] jazz,[9] and 20th century classical music,[10] Radiohead abandoned their three-guitar line-up for a wider range of instruments on Kid A, using keyboards, the ondes Martenot, and, on certain compositions, strings and brass.[8] Original artwork by Stanley Donwood and Thom Yorke, and a series of short animated films called "blips", accompanied the album.

The album won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. It also received praise for introducing listeners to diverse forms of underground music.[6] Despite the band's new direction alienating some fans and critics,[6] Kid A received generally positive reviews from notable music publications.[11] Several publications have rated it as the best album of the 2000s and among the greatest of all time. To date the album has sold over four million copies worldwide.
