The story concerns Clayton Blaisdell, Jr. (known as Blaze for short), a retarded small-time con artist who kidnaps a wealthy gentleman's baby son, in the hopes of fulfilling the dreams of George Thomas Rackley, Blaze's deceased best friend and partner in crime. He imagines that he is still constantly advised by his friend George. Despite the helpfulness of (the imaginary) Georges advice, Blazes world begins to crumble during his kidnapping venture, especially as he bonds with baby Joey.
