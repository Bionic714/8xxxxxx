This contains all current (as of May 9th, 2013) streamlined Mythbusters.

No commercials, no intros, no repetition, no cliffhangers, no switching back and forth between myths. 

Mythbusters the way it's meant to be seen.

All credit for these edits goes to reddit users Postdarwin, Runke, Myfbusted, and MrTwinkles. Postdarwin created the subreddit /r/smyths and you should go there if you want to find more streamlined episodes.
