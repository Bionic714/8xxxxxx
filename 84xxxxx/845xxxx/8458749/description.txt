Current version has 5 Scenes and allows you to control speed, direction, sound horn/bell, control train lights, toggle 23 train models, switch between night and day mode and control the camera pan/zoom around the train. You can also sit inside all of the 23 trains.

I originally wrote this game for my 18 month old son. He was easily able to learn how to control all of the above features within a few minutes. Although the controls are extremely simple even for a kid, adults that like trains will find plenty of enjoyment in this simple yet fun train simulator.
