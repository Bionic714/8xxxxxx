,dopler_,2013-05-11T03:16Z,"hmm IMDB says the language should be Mandarin, but the torrent description says Cantonese../ 
Is the audio in this torrent Mandarin or Cantonese?

If it's Cantonese, why bother uploading? or at least provide dual audio? Chinese dubs are ALMOST as terrible as the Japanese to English dubs... "
