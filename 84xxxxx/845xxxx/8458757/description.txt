Pistol Annies-comprised of Miranda Lambert (Lone Star Annie), Ashley Monroe (Hippie Annie) and Angaleena Presley (Holler Annie)-are back with Annie Up, the follow-up to 2011's Hell On Heels, which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart. The Annies' refreshing sound was met with widespread acclaim, and The New York Times' Ben Ratliff declared Hell On Heels to be 2011's No.1 Album of the Year. "The goal of our music is to have people feel like they're having a conversation with us," said Lambert. With the trio writing all 12 of the tracks on Annie Up, this sophomore collection promises to up the ante on one of the most compelling debuts in recent years. The lead single is "Hush Hush".
