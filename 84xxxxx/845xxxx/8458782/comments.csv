Second, the Laputa that I included contains the old 80s ENG dub (which is awful) and Japanese dub, where both have a pretty dated soundtrack.

I've uploaded another torrent with the much improved soundtrack and English dub with some other great Ghibli films, an improved copy of Porco Rosso as well as Miyazaki's Lupin 3rd Movie.

Also, the program used to convert these files is called ConvertXtoDVD

Thanks!"
