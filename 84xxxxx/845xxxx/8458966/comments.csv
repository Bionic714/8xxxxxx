,hallumet,2013-05-10T13:00Z,"""The citizens of a small town face a nightmare of apocalyptic proportions after a government plane crashes nearby, unleashing a top-secret government experiment that can't be contained.""

Link from info: http://www.amazon.com/Re-Generator-Olivier-Gruner/dp/B00BC1UPQU

Looks like utter shit, embarrassing that things like this reaches this high on thepiratebay. Barely any information available to find. A few online stores apparently sells the DVD, most often with no more information than what is given here. One site mentioned the film having been held back since 2010. Based on that and the information from the given link above that Patrick Shanavian and Olivier Gruner co-directs, I assume that this project is a renamed release of this project: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1578265/reference

Also, the poster presented here is glamoured with fake festival wins that doesn't check out. "

,hallumet,2013-05-10T13:08Z,I see you're quick on deleting revealing comments. Enjoy the economic failure that this project has most likely brought on you.

M avoid like a plague really really bad movie in my opinion but i'm pretty sure someone somewhere will enjoy it"
,csnomis,2013-05-10T13:26Z,"Hallumet, I see you have uploaded NOTHING to Pirate Bay.  So shut your mouth, and enjoy a movie you got for free. You may like it, then go to Amazon and buy it.  You whiny bitch."

Below funny bad.  Nothing to see here, keep moving on."
,iratethep,2013-05-10T15:49Z,"csnomis, you are obviously retarded.

Whether people have uploaded something or not, is COMPLETELY irrelevant.

Let people express their opinions, and shut the fuck up with your orders about what they should think and say about it."

If I were to give you some AIDS for free you would surely enjoy it. I'm merely aiming at illuminating facts. If this release were of quality and/or highly sought out then it would belong here, but contrary to that it gives reason to believe that it's cheated its way up on the list in a desperate attempt at attention. 

I'm very thankful for the good contents that are available to me at this site for free. I'm not claiming to have uploaded anything myself, you have quite the impressive merit of contributions yourself (0). "

,jagdub,2013-05-10T20:22Z,GREAT FILM
,jagdub,2013-05-10T20:23Z,OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN WHERE IS IT? AND YE IM WRITING IN CAPS 
,deadcow1,2013-05-10T20:34Z,this movie was a surprise in that is was worst than I expected and I have a history of getting drunk and watching really shitty movies.
,flotron,2013-05-10T21:35Z,I can't understand how this movie is more downloaded than iron man 3 R6
,TPBGurl,2013-05-11T04:31Z,"No matter how crappy the movie, how low the budget, some countries who can finally get internet but no movie theaters, dvd stores, or even a Wal Mart to buy a damn DvD player, or worse money to buy any over priced crappy digital movie to watch on there pc, The Pirate Bay is it for them. Maybe there are bombs going off in there town, or just lost there jobs, who knows but people sometime need an escape and a crappy movie for free is better than nothing.

Just my opinion, HeroMaster posts all good rips of the best and the worst. Another words he/she makes it available for us and everyone to download for FREE and thats all that counts. We are lucky the Pirate Bay is still an unsinkable ship but when our freedom of the internet is lost.. we will miss these crappy ole movies we wish we would have stockpiled.

So bad or good and I have seen some horrible ones, lol, thank you for the UPs and the freedom to be here to bitch, whine, and moan :)

CHEERS to great and/or crappy movies! May they keep on making movies so these wonderful uploaders can keep on giving! 

Without asking a damn thing back, putting there ass on the line... Just for YOU."
,iratethep,2013-05-11T12:15Z,"TPBGurl, not one single thing you wrote there, has any relevance at all in this context. NOBODY is saying this movie shouldn't be on pirate bay. How do you not get that?

The point here is, how does an absolutely worthless movie like this, so bad it does not even have an imdb page, so bad there's hardly any information to find about it anywhere at all, still have so many seeders and leechers, so it ends up so high on the list? More than any of the newest hit movies.

Obviously something is going on."
,taistoi,2013-05-11T22:54Z,"put a fucking imdb link, it's not complicated"
,charley0,2013-05-12T22:04Z,"Excellent quality for a not so excellent film, lol *S"
,astrolab,2013-05-16T07:38Z,"never see a low level, dog actors, no story and no way to watch it for more than 5 minutes, please don't post such shit movie, it's an insult to our community, DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!!! A waste time!!! HeroMaster, stop post shit things!!!!!!!!!!"
