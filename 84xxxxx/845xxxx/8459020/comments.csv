We have the same problem. This error is occuring because your DirectX is installed wrong. Try installing it again and if an error comes out saying ""Unable to find version of the runtime to run this application."" It means there is something wrong with you Microsoft .NET Framework. What You should do is to Install a new version of the .NET Framework and Install DirectX at the Dont Starve DXRedist Folder and run DXSETUP.exe  "
