What's cool about it:
Uncompromising survival & world exploration. No instructions. No help. No hand holding. Start with nothing and craft, hunt, research, farm and fight to survive.
Dark and whimsical visuals: 2D characters and odd creatures inhabiting a unique 3D world.
Randomly generated new worlds! Want a new map? No problem! At any time you can generate a new living and breathing world that hates you and wants you to die.
