,scarycake,2013-05-16T17:04Z,"- that is Brazilian how do you expect me to read it.

- a simple hdtv tag means it has been RIPPED from hd (720/1080), not that its HD.

- HD indication =
hdtv 720p
hdtv 1080p

just make a fucking simple search of supernatural on the hd section and see you are the only idiot uploading shitty 350mb stuff"
