Book Description

Sex Bible for Women: The Complete Guide to Understanding Your Body, Being a Great Lover, and Getting the Pleasure You Want.

Most books on sexuality teach women that satisfying their partner is the key to a great sexual experience. However, for most women, great sex is predicated on understanding their own bodies and desires first. Moreover, a woman's sexual desires and preferences aren't fixed-they are greatly impacted by physical changes such as pregnancy, menopause, and hormonal fluctuations.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of all the sexual options available for women throughout their lifetime. Intrepid sex journalist and expert Susan Crain Bakos provides in-depth treatment of every sexual option available to the sexually active woman.

This resource shows any women how to sexually satisfy themselves and their partners, through masturbation, touching, oral sex, and intercourse. Racy, full-color photographs will instruct women on positions, foreplay techniques, and how to use sex toys on themselves or others. Women will also gain a deeper understanding of their own unique physiology, how to achieve orgasm, and how to stay healthy as they explore different sexual options.
