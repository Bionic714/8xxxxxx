Charlie Winston isn't the only compositeur anglais to have acquired a vociferous French following, but he's the only one in recent times to have had a No 1 album there (2009's Hobo) while remaining almost unknown in his home country. France has been captivated by the idea that he's a rakish Anglo troubadour ΓÇô acoustic guitar, jaunty hat, weatherbeaten voice ΓÇô with a streak of Gallic seen-it-allness (as made manifest by the line "I sit around drinking coffee all day/ Nothing to do and a little to say" in Speak to Me). The romance of it all doesn't play quite so well in Britain, but this album is still a palatable addition to the adult-contemporary genre. While his default style is the wronged-Romeo acoustic melancholia of Hello Alone, he's comfortable and convincing in other styles: Princely electro-funk (Until You're Satisfied), beatboxing (Speak to Me) and Paul Youngish white soul (Where Can I Buy Happiness?). All that's keeping him from UK success is the surfeit of similar songwriters, from Chris Rea to his own better-established brother, Tom Baxter
