The Typing of the Dead is an unusual game, its gameplay is unique and extremely fun. Despite its strange, silly premise, it does have a few explicitly gory sequences--some zombies turn into sloppy messes when shot down. But if you like action-packed games or horror movies, you'll probably enjoy The Typing of the Dead...and even if you don't, you might want to give it a try.

It also teaches you to type faster! :D Ported by myself using wineskin.

PLEASE NOTE: When you open the game choose No to the first question and Yes to the second in order for the game to run properly.

Enjoy and please seed.
