,dude.seriously,2013-05-12T02:33Z,"whao the vlc sharpener doesn't turn crap into gold bro compare both versions and u see wht i mean...
crap = i.imgur.com/llEIk4S.jpg VS gold = i.imgur.com/XuJ21MU.jpg ...
yea no sharpener is going to fix that crap buddy.
looking at the 2 turns ur MQ into LQ. and days? r u serious? dude r u batty? it was only like 12 hrs when the other p2p vid was available. get ovr urself. yah guy, the other is p2p, not scene. and dsr is standrd res tv 480i source not web.
get ur facts right so u dont look so dummy and pls stop rushing a rls when ur src look like crap filled diapers. jst honest critticism. can u not tak criticism? not to bash u or ur othr vids. lots of them look good. this one looks bad. like really bad and after watchng the other rls i wld hav to change my a/v rating of this from 7/4 to 5/4"
[V],psspss,2013-05-12T05:06Z,"well seems alright to me.. good enough for me
vlc does a good job.. some of us dont need MP4 to see every dot on the screen

better then nothing..you never know if a source is ever going to show
 you people praise me when I provide the missing content regardless of quality
and when I do and some hdtv comes out you bitch about it then

some bitch and some dont.
some share and some leech and limit upload speeds regardless"
[V],psspss,2013-05-12T05:09Z,"i agree thie source used though was sh1t

the guys source he didnt even remove the interlace and so it flickers on movement in some places
but his was the only one about I used and so I was grateful he put some effect to it.. I just turn it into xvid that will play on tvs and pc
but even though better is out.. I not wasting more data getting better as the shows kinda sucks really he low balls everyone and makes huge money where the people should just use ebay etc to sell online :)"
