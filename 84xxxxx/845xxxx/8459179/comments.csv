1) First off my thanks for some outstanding posts, sir! Been wanting these Jerzy Levitz shows for ages, having watched several of them when they first aired. The Jack Benny ones are also welcome, as was anything Jack did. Especially if it was cheap :P

2) Got a challenge for you: I need a copy of ""Alas, Babylon"". It was a 1960 or so adaptation of Pat Frank's WWIII ""Day After"" novel done for Playhouse 90, but so far none of the other pirates have been able to dig up anything other than a VO over the credits of one ep telling viewers to stay tuned for next week's ep.

2) Here's a *hard* one: ""The Secret Defense of 117"", aka ""The Secret Weapon of 117"". It was Gene Roddenberry's first major SF sale to TV, and IIRC starred Ricardo Montalban. It's not lost, as it was in syndication for several years as part of Chevron Theater's post-network repackaging. It was pulled from syndication in around 1962, and surprisingly hasn't been released or even reshown on SciFi due to the Roddenberry link. What's out there will probably be a bad dupe from what was not one of the best kinescopes - the Left Coast broadcast was kined from the East Coast live performance, and that was how it was preserved. If you can find this, you'll become a hero to millions of trekkies, and to even more millions of Montalban fans, who'll be more than happy to pitch in and line your casket with ""Reech, Coritheeean Leather!""

...Finally, this might not be up your alley, but if you can find it, it would be appreciated so I can stick it up on YouTube: about six years ago, a poor contrast copy of a See-BS news special covering the landing of Surveyor I was discovered in some TV station's news archives. The show was in color, but the 2"" backup was in that RCA/Ampex Mono that tended to lose the contrast signal over time. I*HAD* a copy on DVD, but it disappeared in the recent move, and I'd love to find a  copy so it can be uploaded and preserved on YouTube. The reason this one's so important is that Surveyor I proved that the moon's craters weren't full of massive dust bowls, and that anyone walking on it would sink hundreds of feet down. The proponent for this was a dork named Tommy Gold, who on live TV *refused* to admit he was wrong, and even to the day he died he kept claiming those dust bowls existed all over the place, and that NASA must have lied about any of the EVA crews coming across them.

I met Tommy Gold. He made Doc Brown and Emilio Lizardo look sane.

...Either way, keep up the good work, sir! Smooth Winds at your back, and let the Jolly Roger fly!!"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-10T18:51Z,"Hey Chinga,


I don't have any of those shows you're looking for.
If they're rare then they aren't online!  Everything I've offered in past years was mostly from my own DVD collection.  But to save money in 2012-2013 and to save my Mac optical drive's lifespan....it's since been stuff that I found all over the Internet -- including The Mothers In-Law (all 56 episodes of which, by the way, are on DVD through MPI.  They came out in July 2010).

http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Mothers-In-Law-The-Complete-Series/13681

There are several episodes of Playhouse 90 on You Tube and more on Hulu. Not sure if they one you're seeking ""Alas Babylon"" is there or not.  But if you're here in the U.S. you should check that out. "
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-10T21:19Z,"...Actually, I've seen all the eps of ""The Mothers-In-Law"", both when they first aired, and about 20 years ago when I got hired on a contract gig by the TV station I used to work at to dump a ton of old 16-mm prints of old sitcoms onto 1"" Beta reels so they could dump the prints before the dreaded ""Red Fade"" hit them. Some had already started, but with a little color balance wizardry they came out relatively clean. One ep even had the original commercials still spliced in, of all things!

Did I save a copy for myself? Nope. No foresight at that time, alas.

...""Alas Babylon"" does exist, tho, but it's one of the ""P90""s that hasn't seen the light of day since it's only rerun. The guys over at CONELRAD would really love to get a hand on a copy, especially with a young Burt Reynolds and an even younger Rita Moreno starring in it, but so far zilch. We haven't even been able to turn up a script so we can see how much they pared down that book to fit 78 minutes of airtime.

...But hey, thanks for the reply. I've got a couple of other leads on the Surveyor I special - a buddy at NASA Langley says he thinks there's a 3/4"" dub in the library that he'll cap and post to YouTube if it's still there. I've come to find that See-BS and the other two networks turn a really blind eye to bootleg copies of their space coverage showing up online because technically it's in the public domain because of the subject matter. However, if you want pristine 2nd-gen dubs, See-BS charges a whopping $600 per hour of archive dubbed to VHS, and has no facilities for MPEG-2 or MP4 dubbing - nor has any plans to perform such an upgrade anytime soon. Which sucks because they've got something like 240,000 hours of kinescopes sitting in 11 different libraries just collecting dust, including all of Ed Murrow's stuff, and the almost impossible-to-get network coverage of Gemini III and Apollo 7, both of which were preserved on 35mm Color Kinescope and 2"" Ampex.

I will say this: if you've got any network coverage at all of the Glory Days of NASA - especially the hard-to-find ABC coverage - then I'd love to grab what you have. ABC is pretty rare for the simple fact that *everybody* hated to listen to Jules ""Ol' Doom-n-Gloom"" Bergman, Frank Reynolds was too serious to compensate for Jules' ability to turn a happy occasion into a funeral dirge, and neither Harry Reasoner or Howard K. Smith were that interested in covering space events because they knew they could *never* draw viewers away from Unca Walter Cronkite. But from a historical viewpoint, I'm naturally interested in any and all coverage. I've even got some coverage from Finnish TV, even though I can't understand it any more than ABBA understood a third the english they were speaking :P

...On a side note, going to YouTube is where I always go first. Then if it's there and it's something I *really* want a high-res copy of, I head here and see if it's on the torrents in HD so I can save it to DVD. Most of what I've grabbed from you, however, isn't on YT - yet - which is why I'm grateful for your efforts."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-11T00:28Z,"Well, where do I start ??  Being only in my 40s, but having an appreciation for shows before (and in this case also during) my time I'm old enough to have enjoyed reruns of old TV in the 1970s and even more so in 80s cable stations such as the long-defunct CBN.

I also remember Frank Reynolds and Max Robinson when they were anchors on ABC News, at a time when ABC was still topping the ratings in prime time. Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley were the first TV shows I recorded onto VHS tape but not to collect.

You mentioned Rita Moreno.  Yep, she was sexy back when Playhouse 90 was on the air. I'd like to see that ""Run for Your Life"" episode that she did again.

Burt Reynolds was kind of boring in the decade & 1/2 before he took on his more comic Smokey & the Bandit persona, although he did get to do comedy for the first time in at least one of his GUNSMOKE episodes...when he and Festus got drunk."
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-11T05:30Z,"...Heh, yer not that old, sonny. Old is when you can remember when the network news always had the daily body count in Vietnam, especially on ABC's Evening News, where they had an infographic that not only listed the number of casualties, but had an up or down arrow to denote whether the count was higher or lower than the day before.

...The most vivid memories of those body counts, tho, were in the weeks before all the cease fires and the Paris Peace Talks finally seemed to be doing some good. One day we went from 200+ to ~20 then 3-4 a day and then all of a sudden the count was zero. The newspapers were reporting the next day that for about an hour after Harry Reasoner made the announcement with no fanfare at all, phone exchanges across the country were jammed with people calling their friends and relatives to ask ""did you see that? did he really say nobody got killed in Vietnam today???"" And yet, outside of that note in the papers, none of the news services made any major observance of that milestone/turning point in the war.

...But yeah, I'm about a decade older than you, with my earliest memories being TV programming starting around the fall of '64. The premier of ""Rudolph the Mutant Reindeer"" stands out the most, with the first two Gemini missions being the next in line - Gemini IV actually started an unbroken chain of never missing a manned US launch on TV until April of '08, when I missed a Shuttle launch due to a medical issue. But during those years I caught a lot of classic TV, and my moon landing story is a classic unto itself.

Oh, and I'm one of the few people in my area who actually saw the only episode of ""Turn On"", one of the ""Holy Grails"" of classic TV collecting. Most people are only aware of two episodes - the pilot with Tim Conway as host that was the only episode aired, and the second one hosted by Robert Culp and France ""Elaan"" Nuyen, of which only about 2 minutes total has ever been seen - but there were a total of six filmed. IIRC, IMDB doesn't even list all six, so who hosted those other four eps hasn't been revealed. As a testament to how bad the show was, none of those four hosts have ever confessed their sins :P :P

...As for Burt, straight acting was never his forte.  Comedy suited him better, and he got rich off of it when he made the jump. ""Gunsmoke"" was not a show I got into back then, nor most of the other oatburners. I did get into ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" in reruns, and naturally have the whole run on my server. ""Hec Ramsey"" is one I've been looking for, but so far only the pilot has shown up on YouTube. If you've never seen that show, it's essentially Paladin meets Quincy, with only proprietary rights preventing the show's creators from admitting ""Yeah, he's Paladin, only a lot older, a lot smarter, and doesn't use his gun as often as he does anachronistic forensics techniques"".

Oh, and ""Bonanza"" and ""Kung-Fu"", with ""Alias Smith & Jones"", ""F-Troop"", ""Here Come the Brides"", and ""Laredo"" mixed in the middle here and there. Never did care for ""The Virginian"", tho, and ""The Men from Shiloh"" still ranks among the bottom of the horsepile along with ""Custer"" - the latter being the reason ""Time Tunnel"" was cancelled after being renewed for a second season, being ABC's only new show for it's one season to actually bring in decent ratings.

...Out of curiosity, what have you got in the way of old, complete network nightly news programs? Preferably those from the 60s. There's a few complete ones out there featuring Unca Walter, but only partial ones featuring Chet and David. Ones from the mid-70s on become more available as home VCRs had become affordable, but by then we were in the Carter Misadministration, and the nightly news was no longer any fun to watch.

Side note: pleasure to come across someone else with the same level of classic TV appreciation. And I thought Billy Ingram over at TV party and I were a dying breed :)"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-11T05:53Z,"Sorry.... I never got into collecting TV news programming. There's a great deal of that on You Tube already as you know.

Also in 2003 when I bought my first DVD recorder, I sold my last VCR to my landlady at the time for $50. Plus I threw out the tapes I had left. 

Having never seen ""Turn On"" (ABC's disasterous answer to NBC's Laugh-In) I wasn't aware there were 4 shows taped.  But I know from reading about it that only the Tim Conway show aired.

France Nuyen and the late Robert Culp were married and eventually divorced, plus she turned up as a guest star in a few episodes of I SPY -- one during each of its 3 seasons.  I bought the complete series disc set years ago -- the one in which Culp picked his favorite episodes and he did 2 & 1/2 hours of audio commentary for the DVDs on the alternate audio tracks."
