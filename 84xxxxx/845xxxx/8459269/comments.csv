You confuse me with someone else. All my encodes have DTS @768, not 1500.
And it's called trans-coding, not ""screwing around"".
What's the point in compressing video but not audio.
Adding DTS-HD would make video about 12 GB!
Adding the core 1500 would make it 10 GB.
The core 1500 is not any better then 768 trans-coded from full DTS-HD.
Nothing wrong with this audio, most people are happy with it, if you don't like it look somewhere else.
You're welcome."
