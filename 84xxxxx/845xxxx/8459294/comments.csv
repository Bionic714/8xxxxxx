,LazarusL,2013-05-10T20:41Z,"YOW! If that had downloaded any faster, it might have scorched my wi-fi router! You have nothing to apologize for, ajaxen94. Thanks very much for the upload."
[T],ajaxen94,2013-05-10T22:14Z,"@LasarusL the speed you downloaded it at was probably due to the people who had already downloaded it and were seeding it at the time, it usually takes about 1 hour for people to download 100 mbs from me so thanks really go to the people who seed it after their download has finished"
