Plot

Don and Ellie Griffin, a long divorced couple, are forced to pretend that they are still happily married at their adopted son Alejandro's wedding. His biological mother, Donna, a Catholic from Colombia, is also attending, and has not been told that her son's adoptive parents have gotten divorced. Among all of their family and friends, the hoax snowballs into a story about the ties that bind.
