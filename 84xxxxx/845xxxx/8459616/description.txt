I enjoyed re-reading these plays, in modern language.   Then I was able to 
reread some passages in old english to appreciate old Bill's phrasing
... not bad!

Have fun... and please make sharing one of your life's goals. 

Thought for the day:  Copyright should be limited to 5 years from 
the earlier of creation or first publication.  This encourages creative
building on what came before.  It also recognizes that the value of any
well known cultural item (such as a book, movie, or song) comes mostly 
from the shared understanding the public has about the work, not from 
the creator of the work.  ie - Social Popularity is a reward from the 
public, thus it should be owned by the public.  It is separate from the 
work itself.
