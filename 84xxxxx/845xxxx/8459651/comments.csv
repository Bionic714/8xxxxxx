,2.5Kburn,2013-05-11T04:47Z,"Solid work, as always, nos!
This is actually the game I had been wanting you to release most.  Had finally given up and downloaded another release (just yesterday, matter of fact), but now that this is out I'm gonna be using it instead.
I assume this means you'll be releasing GRiD 2?"
,mindcrasher,2013-05-11T12:49Z,very nice nosTEAM again I will always love your cracks 
,rdm6265,2013-05-12T10:11Z,isn't this an old game ?
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-13T04:07Z,"Old indeed, but the new one is coming out soon.
Besides, nosTEAM releases new and old.
Typically based on requests on his website, not on what's already out here."
,Mrkillerar,2013-05-13T19:33Z,Metro last light plz
,scammyguy,2013-05-14T21:18Z,nosTEAM steals their releases from other groups and slaps a bunch of SPAM and popups ads on them.
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-15T02:03Z,"@scammyguy

Which is actually somewhat true, except we don't complain because they almost universally work.
And when they don't, it's never very long before he's released a patch on his site to fix it.
So, I don't see why it's even worth mentioning.
Take your free game, or don't.
But don't bitch about working software."
