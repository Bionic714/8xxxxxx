Jennifer West in the title role plays an attractive MILF who has three pretend teen daughters who she essentially pimps out (in her home) to blackmail all and sundry who are seduced by them. They not only pretend to be her kin but also 15 years old (hardly credible), putting the rogues in jeopardy. The film unfolds like an endless dinner party, with guests heading for the bedroom to get down with the kids Faith, Hope and Charity. Of course the scheme unravels, but the sex scam is fun to watch.
