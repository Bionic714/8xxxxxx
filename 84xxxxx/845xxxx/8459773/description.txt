beaTunes

A music collection is like a garden. It grows and we want it to grow. But if we leave it unattended for too long, things go haywire: The same artist's name is spelled in different ways and his pop ballads are suddenly labeled as classic rock.

beaTunes supports you, the gardener, to fix things up again, so that everything is neatly organized.
