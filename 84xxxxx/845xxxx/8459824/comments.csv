,Freeflow123,2013-05-12T01:49Z,"I agree, it is not really ""old"".  I scraped a lot of books where older, and more contemporary texts are presented side by side. 

Although Dickens is quite readable by most people today, I consider myself well read, and quite literate, and yet I find Shakespeare quite difficult to really understand.   If you take a look at the contemporary text for Shakespeare's plays, its wonderful to actually understand that is going on, although I admit, one loses out on the authors lovely phrasing.   

But once the gist is understood, then going back to the original text is more compreshensable, and enjoyable.   

At least that's my 2 cents worth."
