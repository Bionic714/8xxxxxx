English band in the progressive jazz field. Lots of horns and distant organ harmonies, guiutars, and really for fans of IF and maybe GRAHAM BOND, KEEF HARTLEY BAND.
Jazz-rock organ sounds from the late 60s by this UK band who were possibly the most enduring club-organ r'n'b band to come from the swinging 60's mod scene.This(mostly) instrumental powerhouse outfit delivered this their 2nd album from 1969 of original material 'Composed specifically for the Frog style of musical interpretation, ranging far in beat, tempo and mood'. Contains the brilliant "Eddie's Tune" that could have graced the Rubble series.
