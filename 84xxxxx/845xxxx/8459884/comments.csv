Can a Golden Age Ray collection be far behind? OR a Red Bee? :) :) :)"
,Mothra67,2013-05-10T18:51Z,The Ray is next!
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-10T23:09Z,"...Outstanding, sir! Another gold star for your spangles! :)"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-11T05:32Z,"...FYI, I'll seed this thru the weekend, and pump up the upload speed a bit to help everyone complete as much as they can. Good upload, Mothra!"
,Mothra67,2013-05-11T16:57Z,"Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the Ray UL as well!"
