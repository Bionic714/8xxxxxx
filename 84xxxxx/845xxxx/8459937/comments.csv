,tdurden83,2013-05-11T06:21Z,thx for the upload. it kind of reminds me of the cartoon this nice older guy used to show me and my friend in the back of his bicycle shop when I was little
,midgar7,2013-05-11T10:08Z,"Thank you YIFY for this.

Entimus if you do not like, then don't come here.
I'm happy with the quality."
,aplldth,2013-05-12T04:54Z,Midgar I think he was being sarcastic
,sirmetric,2013-05-12T14:28Z,@tdurden83  wha'choo talkin bout willis?
,arnban,2013-05-13T01:03Z,"I am Grateful for the upload, but have admit that the reason why i chose the HD category are because i want full experience of my HT Equipment, That means not only high res video but also 6channel audio, i Guess that means i agree With entimus`s comment"

,Vorrrz,2013-05-15T04:38Z,@entimus SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU DICK! YIFY is the biggest up loader on this site and your gonna complain. The thing is 1080p and your seriously gonna bitch about it. Get fucked you dippy cunt. Its for free you dick.
,xarinl,2013-05-15T20:59Z,Is it possible to rip in 5.1 audio format? Also if it was ripped in 5.1 format what would happen to those who have only stereo? 
,Drewmeister11,2013-05-16T07:41Z,@Vorzz He was being ironic.  I think.  
,Tichie,2013-05-18T01:04Z,"Thanks for the great quality, but don't care for the subtitles... are they embedded right in the video?"
,supergrl,2013-05-18T19:24Z,"@YIFY  Thanks for all the uploads

@Tichie  The .srt file is the subtitles, just delete it. They aren't coded right into the video. (Easier than explaining how to disable them since I don't know what you are using to play the video)"
,67hairboy,2013-05-19T10:57Z,"@tdurden83, (Fight Club?): Thanks a lot, dude. Now I'm gonna be having nightmares... about creepy-assed bicycle repairman, and Bugs Bunny re-runs."
