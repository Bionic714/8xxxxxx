This is an up-to-date collection of all The Walking Dead comics and novels.  All comics are in .cbr format (I believe), and have been renamed uniformly with their volume name and release date (by volume), with the exception of #109 and #110, which have not been released in a volume yet but are included.  Also included are the first two books of the Governor Trilogy of novels in .epub format.

*** NOTE ***
I DID NOT create any of these files and do not take any credit for them.  The closest to this is that I removed a couple of "flip-over" comics from two issues and recompiled the .cbr's.  I simply compiled the collection.  Please give credit to the original creators.
