Schisms in Christianity - Collection 7:

Schism, reformation, heresy, .. are many faces of the same coin. In Europe, they were major causes of religious wars and civil wars. Several uploads about the schisms in Christianity were made early in the first year of the project. There were 6 uploads in total; each has a unique title and they did not carry a numbering of sequential collections. 
We return to the same topic with Collection7 in the series, and it has 29 titles.
