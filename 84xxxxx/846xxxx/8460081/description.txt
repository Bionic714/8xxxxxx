Please, pay attention to book "Summerhill - A Radical Approach To Child Rearing" by Alexander Sutherland Neill (or - A. S. Neill). This book may inspire you and change your worldview same as with Jacque Fresco. This book was written near ~1960th, and it is already translated at least on dozen languages.

Thank you.
