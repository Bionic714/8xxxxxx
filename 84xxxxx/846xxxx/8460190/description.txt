
Carmageddon is the original freeform driving sensation, where pedestrians (and cows!) equal points, and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. The game features anarchic drive-wherever-you-like gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence. ItΓÇÖs the racing game where racing is for wimps.

Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back and available on Android phones and tablets!

Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to ΓÇ£play it your wayΓÇ¥ΓÇª Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps. Oh and watch out ΓÇô the cops in their super-tough armoured patrol vehicles are lurking, and if they catch you being bad theyΓÇÖll be down on you like several tons of cold pork!
