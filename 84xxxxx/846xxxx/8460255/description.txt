SYNOPSIS:- Dhooli (1954) Bengali
Parashar (Prashant Kumar), the young grandson of a drummer (low caste), is a talented singer who is taken in as a student by a renowned singer Ganesh. When Ganesh finds him extraordinarily talented, he sends him on to his own Guru (Pahadi Sanyal). Thee Parashar also meets the Guru's daughter, Minati (Suchitra Sen). When guruji dies, Parashar starts to take care of Minu and also gives music lessons.

One day, in a competition they come across Ratri (Mala Sinha) daughter of a rich man and also a talented singer. She is no match for Minu. Enter her fiance (Bikash Ray), the schemer. Who hits upon the idea to hire Parashar as the teacher of Ratri, and then manipulates so that Parashar becomes the full time, live-in teacher. Minu is left behind as Parashar blinded by Ratri's talent takes on the job.

One day, Ratri, against the advice of Parashar takes part in a competition in Delhi, and corners glory. The two have a fight and Ratri insults Parashar for being a low caste man with vaulting ambition. She has no further need for him amd he is thrown out into the streets. He falls desperately ill. Minati gets to know and rushes there and tries to save him with all the love and resources at her command...

Comments by Debpk
As a film this one has very little to recommend it. The lead actor is wooden in the extreme (he disappeared without a trace subsequently), the story line is implausible and the dialogues are stilted. The characters are cardbord pieces - entirely predictable and stereotyped. Almost the only actor who does some justice to his role is Bikash Ray, as the wily fiance. Even Suchitra Sen's acting is only passable as is Mala Sinha's. The characters and settings are theatrical, as was common in the early 50's.

What sets it apart is the music and the songs. This movie contains some of the greatest short classical pieces ever recorded for Bangla films. Just take a look at the galaxy of musicians that lent their voices or played instruments in this film..
