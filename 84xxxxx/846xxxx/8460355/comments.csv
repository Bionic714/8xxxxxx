My PS3 runs CFW Rogero 4.30 and Multimen 4.20 but the game returns to XMB after the Duplex logo. Any clue/help?"
,Jasooooon,2013-05-13T14:54Z,"Duplex fucking failed, there is a point in the game where you're with another soldier & he doesn't move. Which stops everyone from progressing :("
,wooled,2013-05-19T04:23Z,FUCK YOU DUPLEX! YOU PURPOSELY CUT OFF THE FUCKING GAME RIGHT BEFORE THE ENDING! YOU ASSSHOLE!
,GopherTee,2013-05-22T08:24Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
,nightdecoder,2013-05-31T13:30Z,"Works for me! Thanks DUPLEX and thenoobish!
I'm on Rogero CFW 4.30 (4.40 REBUG fake)

If you have black screen after running, try to enable BD Mirror in game setting (Multiman)"
