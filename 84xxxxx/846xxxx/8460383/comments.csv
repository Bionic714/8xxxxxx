,Robin1966,2013-05-11T01:27Z,"Many thanks my friend.

Saw the director being interviewed on Bloomberg earlier and the presenter was frightened that this film might make people so angry that they would attack bankers too!

Just had to watch it!!!"
,thorrus,2013-05-11T08:28Z,"I almost started the download but noticed Uwe Ball's name...
no thanks :D"
,GeorgeMack,2013-05-11T10:10Z,"@thorrus Yeah that was close!!....moron Because all the other actors in the industry reek quality. 

@Robin1966 Or just the basis for a false flag operation whatever comes first. Because you know martial law's been on the agenda, or so its been told among conspiracy theorists. Fuck it watch the film"
,GeorgeMack,2013-05-11T10:17Z,"Shit Uwe is directing, i'm going back to hangover where the quality is. Is he really alive? Is he cloned? Do we deserve it?"

,edalbkrad,2013-05-11T16:41Z,"I will try this movie because of purcell. Honestly what was he thinking? working with uwe-sucks-balls!
He should've taken one of those guns and bashed in uwe's head.
That wouldve been a great movie"
,bighouse5,2013-05-11T17:03Z,"You know what, i im starting to love Uwe Boll! Awesome movie!"
,dezzie50,2013-05-11T19:15Z,"i film glorifying random shootings and massacres, just what America needs right now (not)
"
,scuzz08,2013-05-11T19:38Z,"The name ""Uwe Boll"" might bring you to skip this, but he did do a pretty good job with ""Rampage."" That was a good movie, maybe this is too."
,vampzcore,2013-05-11T21:09Z,thanks!!
,mr_brand,2013-05-12T00:27Z,"thanks scene4all...just what I needed 4 a saturday night. I like Purcell's acting from the time of Prison Break.

Cheers mate!!!"
,dfl3506,2013-05-12T00:59Z,"A10, V10 Agree with dezzie50, senseless shootings of innocent people is supposed to be justified because the guy lost his money?"

,wynterbourne,2013-05-12T03:49Z,I can't believe I'm actually downloading a Uwe Boll film. 
,bragazar1710,2013-05-12T05:27Z,thanks!
,Erenath,2013-05-12T07:12Z,"It was a good movie with great quality and sound. But, I find it disturbing that they made it seem like mass murder is OK if the people killed somewhat deserved it.. I'm sure all terrorists, mass murderers and serial killers throughout history though so too.. "
,radovan,2013-05-12T09:58Z,"Uwe Boll made his first (and i cant belive i'm saying this) good movie.
worth a watch"
,Bendico,2013-05-12T11:22Z,"Yeah, I was about to download this film (which sounded like a piece of crap), and then I noticed the name of the director: Uwe Boll.

And thought: yep, I was right. It's crap."

Please read this GeorgeMack... you might learn something for the first time in your life. It's more likely that you will still live in denial, but on the off chance that you do learn something then your life will definitely be better afterwards."
,zac872,2013-05-12T11:38Z,"i wil watch it for lincoln burrows
*thumbs up* scene4all for the upp , will seed for a week."

,thebalilama,2013-05-12T15:46Z,Make sure you are set up so you don't get sued by Uwe. He doesn't like us very much. http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/05/28/uwe-boll-wants-to-sue-you
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-12T18:59Z,"U FUCKING KIDDING ME ? MY GRANDMA COULD MAKE A BETTER STORY,I WAS FUCKED WASTING MY TIME DLING THIS UP THIS SO CALL MOVIE THIS IS PURE MTF SHIT."
,skareo,2013-05-12T21:25Z,"Uwe Boll, you can't sue me because I wouldn't even waste my bandwidth on any of the trash you create. It's garbage."
,ZizzyTheNo0b,2013-05-12T21:36Z,"Really good movie, but worst ending ever. I mean, the last scene.. Really?"
,DrMD,2013-05-12T23:08Z,"Uwe Boll says it all, you pretty much know it's gonna be crappy so nuff said, A/V=9 M=generous 4 cause there's nothing on cable at the time."
,c0ldpr0xy,2013-05-13T22:07Z,"I am an Uwe Boll hater. I hate him because of his raging personality and his crappy directing skills and the destruction of the video game adaptions.

BUT! The story seemed extremely intriguing and I went anyways to watch it. I cannot believe I am going to say this but for Uwe Boll, this was actually an ""okay"" film. This is a film to watch when you have absolutely nothing better to do.

I am just being objective about the movie, I still hate Uwe Boll and I hope he gets sodomized with a baton."
,thr0waway,2013-05-15T09:40Z,"Good movie, the wife scene is a bit sad. Worth a watch. The whole movie is believable, compared to Jack Reacher. The ending is a bit... meh. I mean, the cops could've recognized [main character's name] by just looking at his bold head and the same suit that he entered the building in.

A/V/M=9"
,Phelterup,2013-05-17T05:32Z,So im taking it as do not download.
,Duskmo,2013-05-17T23:32Z,I stopped at.... Uwe Boll
,achrafitou,2013-05-18T22:55Z,One of the worst films I've ever seen! Booooooring and stupid story
,boxatoys,2013-05-19T13:42Z,"This could have been a good movie if the script was stronger as it turned out to be boring at the start. The actors were ok but suffered from a bad script and director, pity really.

Cant understand how the hell it got 6 on imdb, more like a 3.5.
"
,koxxit,2013-05-20T00:24Z,This is actually not a bad movie. The story was decent and the actors where good. Even if it's a bad director I wouldn't be afraid of watching it:)
,Nutinurgut,2013-05-20T02:38Z,"Hated Uwe Boll since Bloodrayne, but this was a good movie. This and Rampage are his best.

The backstory was impressive, it all made sense however when the execution came to happen it was so fucking stupid. So many flaws everywhere, and at the end is so fucking stupid it's unreal."

Completely cardboard acting, the plot is lackluster and completely slow and predictable.
A shame because the issue is so important.

I do NOT recommend this movie, but if you have to see it, then this copy is a good one."
,woprr,2013-05-25T07:10Z,"Well, Wall Street alone is guilty for all the casualties of the 2008 crash but there're still no Judges for them.

So how can anyone be more American than doing what's real American Justice..."
,jannel13,2013-05-29T15:28Z,"Why is this not happening for real ?
Would be a good start."

thanks scene4all "
,PhreeSht,2013-06-03T19:27Z,"So many loose ends it's unreal, cameras clearly record this guy and the plot is alright but so stupid at times. He would have been sent death row. Watch it on a rainy day when you have absolutely nothing left to do."
