
Super Bunny Land combines familiar platformer elements with endless runners into a new game!

An original control scheme gives you full control over your character: press the right side of the screen to jump and press the left side to brake. The game provides both handcrafted and randomly generated terrain.

Collect the carrots and discover all 5 different power-ups! Compete against your friends to run as far as possible with cross-platform leaderboards using Scoreloop.

There are 75 missions for you to complete. For those who crave for more, play Challenge Mode! Extra difficult levels which are free to download (costs in-game coins). For more dlc, keep an eye on the Hei Games twitter account (@heigames)

*Note: Scoreloop social features may not all be functional*
