As Billy and "Captain America," Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda motored down the highway on their Harley Davidsons to the roaring strains of Steppenwolf's "Born to Be Wild," the definitive counterculture blockbuster was born. Former clean-cut teen star Hopper's down-and-dirty directorial debut, Easy Rider heralded the arrival of a new voice in film, one pitched angrily against the mainstream. After Easy Rider's cross-country journey-with its radical, New Wave-style editing, outsider-rock soundtrack, revelatory performance by a young Jack Nicholson, and explosive ending-the American road trip would never be the same.
