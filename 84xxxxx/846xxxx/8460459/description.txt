Art Tatum - 1991 - The Standard Sessions: 1935-1943 Transcriptions

While it may be likely that serious fans of Art Tatum may own many or all of the recordings in this two-CD compilation released by Storyville with the blessings of the late pianist's estate, the acquisition of this particular edition should still be considered. First of all, the remastering exceeds all of the earlier LPs put out by various labels and equals or exceeds any other CD versions. The detailed liner notes by Arnold Laubich, who is likely the greatest authority of the music of Art Tatum, are another good reason, as is the label's use of a rarely published photograph of Tatum. But the most obvious incentive to purchase this collection is Tatum's matchless solo performances, 61 in all, of standards such as "Begin the Beguine," "The Man I Love," "Star Dust," and "Over the Rainbow," along with show pieces such as the semi-classical "Elegie" and romps through "Tiger Rag" and "Tea for Two." The songs all come from the Standard Transcriptions library, and while they were made initially for broadcast purposes (and never intended for commercial issue), these tracks showcase Art Tatum at his very best.
