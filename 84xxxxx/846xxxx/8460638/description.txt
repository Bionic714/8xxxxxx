Maddox is running. 
By accident, he discovered long ago that he was adopted as a baby and his need to find his biological father has consumed him ever since. Now, on a road trip, determined to find his father and his sanity, and armed with locations and his cousin, Nixon, to help him, maybe he can find the answers heΓÇÖs been searching for. With nothing but a suitcase and a wad of cash to get him there, lead after lead takes him further from home.
But heΓÇÖll find much more than he intended.
He finds Storey, a pint sized pin-up model who has learned painful lessons about guys. Her wounds run deep, but so do his. She knows what she wants, but will she recognize it when itΓÇÖs right in front of her?
Maddox canΓÇÖt touch anyone without feeling like his skin is crawling, but just maybe his instinct to protect this amazing girl will supersede his own hang-ups. 
If he can brush her skin and start to feel alive inside...everything will change.
