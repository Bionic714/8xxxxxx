Sleeping Beauty is a 1958/1959 American animated musical fantasy film
produced by Walt Disney and based on the fairy tale "La Belle au bois
dormant" by Charles Perrault. The 16th animated feature in the Walt
Disney Animated Classics series, it was released to theatres on
January 29, 1959 by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the last fairy
tale produced by Walt Disney due to its initial box office disappointment;
the studio did not return to the genre until years after Disney's
death with the release of The Little Mermaid
