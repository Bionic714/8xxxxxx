V 3 Plus their is a lot of useless Chinese writing all over it. Do not waste your time with this. Not and R6- or R5 line. Does not even come close to a DVD version. This is a cam version with theater audio"
,WayneCowan,2013-05-11T08:21Z,This is really a bad copy
,phasar,2013-05-11T15:29Z,"absolute crap!

one of the worst copies out there"
,notuboo,2013-05-11T17:52Z,"I use my 60"" flat screen as a monitor . This movie is watchable and there are far worse copies out there being bragged about.

It's not a DvDrip as the title implies, if it was, someone doesn't have a clue as to what they are doing.

For a cam, A6V6
For a Dvd copy, forget it, it's not on the scale.

The movie is watchable and enjoyable. It has a small footprint in size and you can waste much more bandwidth for a crappier copy.

Thanx to the uploader."
,notuboo,2013-05-11T17:57Z,"I forgot to mention the Chinese sub, at times, not too distracting. But dam, the water mark for the website. At least you move it around to different parts of the screen.

Just list your site www.44pd....... once at the start. We really don't care who you are, sure, your ego needs to be buffed, so thank you, but then just walk the fuck away.

Thanx again for the upload. "
