This is Skyrim (Razor + RELOADED Update 13) 1.9.32.0.8
Included is:
Skyrim
Dragonborn
Dawnguard
Hearthfires
HI Res
and SKSE 1.9

This is a simple package of Skyrim that I use as a backup. Feel free to download it if you want. If anyone starts bitching at me about it being from both of their releases then I ask you this: Who are they to bitch at me? And who are you to say anything?

I have purchased all of these (for the most part &gt;_&gt;) so I've done my due-diligence.

Included is everything to run the base game with all DLC's and SKSE simply Unzip to any part of your hard-drive and create a shortcut. Everything works out of the box, no install, or anything. When you run the Launcher (WHICH YOU REALLY REALLY REALLY SHOULD DO) first it will say "Install" instead of play. Just click install and it will run normally.

Good day,
