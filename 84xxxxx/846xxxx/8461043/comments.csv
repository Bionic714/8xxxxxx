,beaujoulais,2013-05-11T07:44Z,"A pretty respectful celebration 'Part 500' - 1000 thanks and a hook for all these! 
Keep going on with your great project and with us!
Love and peace for you, Zlatko, and all the other music video fans at TPB. Wish we once could meet for a famous party and drink some pines of beer and celebrate our dream of peace and freedom.

Hi Tom 
everything is possible
but probally we will have little problem with dehou. Our friend from Argentina is very far away and of course, 
another problem can be my little ""witch""  
she dont like to see me when i drink beer with my friends without her .............."
,dehou,2013-05-11T23:15Z,"Zlatko!!! congrats on #500!

yes, getting together doesn't seem to be posible, but maybe the next time we are drinking beer we can raise a pint in the air and think of this."
,MYGTHO,2013-05-12T01:32Z,Thats a good idea Dehou cheers Beaujoulais Dehou and last but not least the video legend himself Zalatko i'm drinking Coopers Pale Ale i live in Australia CHEERS
