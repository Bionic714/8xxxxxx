Information
------------------------------

Hugh Laurie makes a musical pilgrimage across America to delve into the story of the country's blues music. When he was a boy, Hugh heard a recording of a concert featuring blues legend Professor Longhair playing on board the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. As a tribute, Hugh gigs his way across the USA before playing a concert in homage to his musical hero on the very same ship. On the way, he visits the studios of Ray Charles and plays the blues star's own piano. He also meets Mudd Morganfield, the son of Muddy Waters, and duets with Jools Holland.
