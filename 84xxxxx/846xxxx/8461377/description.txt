If you fancy giving it a go without having to get up at the crack of dawn every day Farm Frenzy is the game for you!

Soon youΓÇÖll be producing vast quantities of products and turning over a huge profit.

As well as the standard upgrades the really canny player may unlock special VIP bonuses, these include super-fast transport vehicles, automatic water-pumps and discount cards to secure cheaper purchasing of animals for your farm!
