Long story short I been looking for this game for about 4 years now. Finally got a hold of a copy on eBay and decided to share it with the rest of the world. 

I have also scanned the front and back cover and the user manual and included them as images in the torrent.

CD's 1&2 have been ripped in .bin format to preserve audio track's and has been tested use daemon tools to mount.

If running windows Vista/7 set windows 98/me compatibility mode for best results.


Have fun!

P.S seeding this torrent using my Raspberry Pi let me know if you have any problems with download speed. I should be uploading at 5 Mbits/sec.
