One month before the annual firemenΓÇÖs charity auction, fireman Wade Hartman announces heΓÇÖs gay. This year when he strolls down the catwalk, he wants to leave with a man. When the only bid he receives is a pity bid, WadeΓÇÖs crushed, but he lets his friend take him to dinner anyway.

Real estate conglomerate, Jared KesslerΓÇÖs loved Wade for years. So when he reads the article about the firemanΓÇÖs charity event, he knows he has to be the winning bidder. Mistaken as an unwanted bidder, Jared refuses to give up. He wants Wade, if only for one night.

One innocent dinner turns into fiery passion. But one night isnΓÇÖt enough for Wade. He wants Jared for real. The more Wade pushes, the closer he comes to discovering the deep, dark secrets of JaredΓÇÖs past. Can love conquer JaredΓÇÖs fears or are his wounds too deep for even love?
