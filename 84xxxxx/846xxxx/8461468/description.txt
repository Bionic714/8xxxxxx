Plot: Two English cartographers visit the small South Wales village of Ffynnon Garw, to measure what is claimed to be the ΓÇ£first mountain inside of WalesΓÇ¥. ItΓÇÖs 1917, and the war in Europe continues. The villagers are very proud of their ΓÇ£mountainΓÇ¥, and are understandably disappointed and furious to find that it is in fact a ΓÇ£hillΓÇ¥. Not to be outwitted by a rule (and the Englishmen who enforce it), the villagers set out to make their hill into a mountain, but to do so they must keep the English from leaving, before the job is done.
