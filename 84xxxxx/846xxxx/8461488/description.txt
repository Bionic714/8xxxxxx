Just as Spencer, Ryder, and Luc begin to adapt to their new lives together, the local Alpha gives them the option to join the pack or move out. Rather than deal with werewolf politics, they decide to head out and find a home elsewhere. Along the way they encounter Dean, a hitchhiker hoping to thumb a ride to a new life. The chance encounter leads to much more between the stranger and Ryder.

When Spencer and Luc walk in on them in a compromising position, Spencer fears he's lost the first man he's ever loved. But Spencer has a secret. Will Luc stay with him once he discovers the truth or will he end up alone in his new home?
