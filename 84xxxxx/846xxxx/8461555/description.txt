Three years ago, Bear McKennaΓÇÖs mother took off for parts unknown with her new boyfriend, leaving Bear to raise his six-year-old brother Tyson, aka the Kid. Somehow theyΓÇÖve muddled through, but since heΓÇÖs totally devoted to the Kid, Bear isnΓÇÖt actually doing much livingΓÇöwith a few exceptions, heΓÇÖs retreated from the world, and heΓÇÖs mostly okay with that. Until Otter comes home.

Otter is BearΓÇÖs best friendΓÇÖs older brother, and as theyΓÇÖve done for their whole lives, Bear and Otter crash and collide in ways neither expect. This time, though, thereΓÇÖs nowhere to run from the depth of emotion between them. Bear still believes his place is as the KidΓÇÖs guardian, but he canΓÇÖt help thinking there could be something more for him in the world... something or someone.
