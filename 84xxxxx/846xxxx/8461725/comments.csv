And i am so happy that you are doing The naked gun because Hot shots duology & Naked gun trilogy are my all time favourite comedy movies :)"
,dalesteyn,2013-05-11T10:51Z,"brilliant,just brilliant numbers(u know what i mean).This is the real SHIT... ;)"
,jalucian,2013-05-13T16:32Z,"Did either of you watch this on a larger screen? I know the fact that it's shot on 70's film doesn't help, but could you see a difference from the increased bit rate? Did this 720 have the same quality as the 1080s?"
,onlyHD,2013-05-15T20:22Z,"The quality is pretty decent for a 720p in my 21 inch screen !!!

Could you mention your coming uploads ??

And also waiting for THE NAKED GUN :)"
,jalucian,2013-05-16T14:23Z,"As for upcoming releases: The Naked Gun 720p (the last of the low bit-rate 720's without a 1080p source), Jolene 1080p by request, Lolita 576p with extras and (I believe) director's commentary track, 9 Songs 720p (high bit-rate), a decent 480p version of Quills - those are the definites. Possibles include: Lila Says 480p, Clip (Klip) 720p, and The Secretary 720p. And probably one or two unannounced thrown in as well."
,dalesteyn,2013-05-16T16:43Z,"i've watched it on 24"" screen..it was pretty good..no complain..i think we need someone with a bigger screen to comment,which i don't have atm..but so far as my viewing is concerned it is more than enough for me...considering the availability :)"
,onlyHD,2013-05-17T19:30Z,"@Jalucian: I am updating the list of erotic and controversial films and surprised to see Secretary (2002) in your upcoming movie list because it is in my new list too :)

Cheers mate !!!!"
