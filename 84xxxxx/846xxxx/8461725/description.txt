Notes:

For some reason there is roughly one minute of dead air at the beginning on this source, between the first 10 second intro and the beginning of the movie (at around 1m11s.) I could have chopped off the first 70 seconds and adjusted the subtitles, but I decided not to because of the information displayed during the first 10 seconds. I don't like to mess with sources unless it is absolutely necessary, and one minute isn't that significant.

A fine addition to anyone's "controversial films" collection. Not many movies deal with D/s (Dominant/submissive) relationships. This one does. Some of the stereotypes are present in this movie, but some of the lesser known truths about D/s are in there as well. Definitely not a movie for prudes.
