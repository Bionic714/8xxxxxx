Side Note: Are you on Bleeding Cool by any chance?"
,Mothra67,2013-05-11T06:34Z,"Nah, I am only here on TPB"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-11T06:46Z,"...Oh, and on a historical note for you kids in the peanut gallery, the artist most associated with the Golden Age Ray, Lou Fine, had possibly one of the few pseudonyms in the business that was corny as hell, but still one that you could respect: ""E. Lectron"". It was perfect for an artist drawing someone whose powers essentially turned him into nothing but electrons!

...And those who download this collection will no doubt understand why Fine was one of the top three favorite artists by both Jack Kirby and Joe Simon, as well as many other artists whose careers came along during the Silver Age. I personally met Gil Kane in the 80s, and he listed Fine as one of his favorites, and one who died way too much before his time as DC had reprinted a few of his Ray stories right around the time of his death by a sudden heart attack, and the response was such that had he lived he would have most likely been the artist for the ""Freedom Fighters"" series that came along just a few years later.

...Fine also worked on a strip for ""Boys' Life"" that I wish someone could locate all the pieces and release a collected volume of; ""Space Conquerors"" was one of the last great 50's-style Sci-Fi comic strips that could have easily fit in with the Sci-Fi style of stories found in DC's space anthologies, ""Strange Adventures"" and ""Mystery in Space"". It was a cross between ""Tommy Tomorrow"", ""Star Hunters"", and to a fair extent the ""not-an-inspiration-my-fat-ass-Gene!"" Sci-Fi Film Classic ""Forbidden Planet"".

Lou Fine was one of *the* greats. You kids need to treat yourself to this talent. Especially since he could meet deadlines and didn't have a problem drawing feet...:)

Mothra...uh, you wouldn't happen to have...? :)"

,llaney1,2013-05-11T10:33Z,What are the chances of putting together the Black Condor collection? Please. 
,Mothra67,2013-05-11T16:56Z,I will work on black condor.  It will be out Later today or tomorrow at the latest!
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-11T20:08Z,"...I've got both Mothra's Ray and Uncle Sam torrents seeding now, and will keep them up at least through the weekend. Maybe longer if the demand seems to remain high. I'll do the same for Black Condor, which should be done downloading in about an hour or so on this end.

Excellent work by Mothra, kids. Be sure to thank him and not just leech-n-run...:)"
