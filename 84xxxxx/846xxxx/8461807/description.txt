By Request:  Will Eisner & Lou Fine's The Ray!


The Ray was a reporter named Hubert "Happy" Terrill. He was covering a science and technology beat for The New York Star, with the assignment placing him in the high-flying "strato-balloon" and exploring the upper atmosphere with the vehicle's inventor, Professor Styne. However, an electrical storm struck, and when he left the cabin to close the outer airlock door, "Happy" got the full brunt of it. The storm's energy plus the unfiltered sunlight gave him super powers such as the ability to absorb energy from his surroundings and emit it from his body in any form he chose. Also, He could use the energy to propel himself through the air.
