[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-11T08:07Z,"That's OK.  Randi has spent too many hours on the same topics anyway -- even in the same week!

How about The Ed Schultz Show instead ?

Thanks for these Hartmann shows. Too many for one weekend though. Will have to stretch out listening to these."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-11T08:08Z,That reminds me to set the DVR for Saturdays and Sundays at 2 PM Pacific -- the NEW  Ed Show starts today!

Regarding Randi. It's unfortunate because she is the best at telling it like it is when she wants to. But in 2013, her show has just been devoid of substance. She'll mind numbingly beat a dead horse over and over again. The only time she changes the subject is to beat different horse. I couldn't take the hypocrisy any more. 

She rather talk about clowns like Wayne LaPierre, Ted Nugent or Donald Trump then talk about more pressing issues. I don't give a shit what Ted Nugent said... so stop talking about him! If you don't give a shit either then why do you dedicate a whole show to him?! Doesn't she see that she actually legitimizes them by doing so? She'll go on and on. You'll never hear her talk about the Keystone XL...ever. The only way she addresses concerns over Obama (a rarity) is to attack progressives with legitimate concerns by calling them whiners. She admitts she hates them more than teabaggers. Her cult followers on her website are just as bad. 

You know it's ironic...her fans don't like Ed Schultz. They call him a fraud. Maybe he is...maybe he isn't. But at least he's proactive. He goes out there and gets people into action. By contrast...Randi cannot be bothered. I judge people by their action. "
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-12T04:01Z,You forgot to mention that Randi rarely ever interviews anyone on her show!  Nicole Sandler does every day on her uncensored podcast....and when she fills in for Randi as well.
