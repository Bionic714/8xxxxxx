Thanks"
,obladi78,2013-05-11T07:39Z,I'm not sure if I am seeding the file or not? 
,Ahlat,2013-05-11T09:29Z,"What program are you using? Just make sure that it is uploading, it should show you somewhere the upload speed and maybe stop other things you're seeding for a little while."
,Ahlat,2013-05-11T09:30Z,"Also thanks for this, looks interesting. Is it a scanlation or an english translated version?"
,muckymucks,2013-05-11T10:41Z,Is this porn? I'm asking for a friend.
,obladi78,2013-05-11T17:44Z,"I guess I need to try and reupload a new torrent. I am using utorrent to create the torrent. Under torrent properties, there is a spot to list trackers. I am not sure what to put here, if anything?"
,obladi78,2013-05-11T19:59Z,"I reupped the file. I found a tutorial online, so I think this one should work. utorrent is showing that I am seeding the file.
