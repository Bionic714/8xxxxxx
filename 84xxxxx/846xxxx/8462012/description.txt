Glenn discusses the ongoing lies coming out about the Benghazi attacks and how the government is
 running to cover up their hypocrisy as more news networks unveil evidence of the lies.

  Also, the families of the fallen Seal Team Six members are outraged at being forced
   to hear an imam speak at their loved ones funeral. 

   Plus, shocking news comes out as the IRS apologizes and admits to attacking conservative political 
    funding groups during the 2012 elections.
