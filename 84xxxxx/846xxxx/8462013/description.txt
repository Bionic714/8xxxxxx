Prager 20130510  2 Happiness Hour: Is It Working?

Prager H2: Dennis talks to Dr. Stephen Marmer member of the clinical faculty at UCLA Medical School
 and psychiatrist in private practice in Brentwood, CA.
 The topic is: How do you know whether therapy is working?
  How does the patient know? 
   How does the therapist know?


Prager 20130510  1 Comedy News

Prager H1: Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have treated the Benghazi Consulate attack and
 its aftermath as a subject of mockery.
 That Republicans have pushed to get to the truth about what happened in Benghazi is ridiculed.
 But ABC News, hardly a conservative source, sees a lot of smoke around this issue.
 So, does the BBC..

 The California Legislature is close to passing a bill to allow transgender high school students to
  choose what sports they play and what locker rooms and bathrooms they use..

 The IRS apologizes for targeting conservative groups.
