People struggle with a classification for Donna the Buffalo, so here goes mine: An eclectic jam band that writes excellent songs and is fun for the whole family. I "discovered" Donna the Buffalo about three years ago when I stumbled across a review of a show on the internet. I have been a great fan ever since and my enthusiasm for them spread to my wife and two daughters. Donna the Buffalo introduced me to musical forms that I was not real aware of (old time music and zydeco) and now love, as well as some musical instruments you don't normally hear in a rock band (accordion, fiddle, rubboard). "Life's a Ride" was eagerly anticipated by Donna fans and does not disappoint. The songs are excellent but there is a lack of an extended jam that you would hear at a live show. That's really nit-picking though because I love the album. My favorites are "Blue Skies", "Rockin' Horse", "Life's a Ride", and "Everyday". Check out the album, but see them live if you want a real treat, they particularly shine in the summer festival season.
