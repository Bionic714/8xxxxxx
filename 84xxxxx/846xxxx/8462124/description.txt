Recently I came across these videos which in the form of stories teach us a lot of important things about Islam. The stories are small and to the point keeping in mind the growing impatience amongst the people across the world. Every story has a strong moral which makes us think.

All these stories have a relevance in our day to day life too. Watch these videos as there is no better thing than learning something that helps us make our lives better.
