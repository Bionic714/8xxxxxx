ThereΓÇÖs nothing quite like seeing the look on peopleΓÇÖs faces when you perform something AMAZING.

Then, thereΓÇÖs that cute girl or guy that youΓÇÖve been trying to meet. With iForce, you've got the perfect way to break the ice and get their attention.

Imagine . . .
You ask her to think of her favorite type of food . . . sheΓÇÖs thinking Sushi (Remember sheΓÇÖs only THINKING Sushi!)
After a deep look into her eyes, you doodle what sheΓÇÖs thinking on the phone display, and leave it face down on the table.
The moment she whispers her favorite food, you smile triumphantly. The phone is flipped over and her jaw drops when she sees that you had correctly predicted ΓÇ£SUSHIΓÇ¥ !!

This is just one example of the infinite mentalism effects that you will do.

iForce is a revolutionary performance tool for dazzling friends, colleagues and even clients. Capture attention or draw a crowd at parties, events or trade shows. Everyone will want to know, ΓÇ£HOW did you do that?!ΓÇ¥

You'll read minds . . . predict the future . . . and even engage in a little MIND CONTROL! There's nothing shady or harmful; itΓÇÖs all magic . . . fun and absolutely astonishing.

Part of the illusion is the app itself. Disguised as a simple ΓÇ£DoodleΓÇ¥ program, iForce is lurking inside, unseen and undetectable. Everything is examinable, which adds to the mystery.

iForce is the ONLY product that lets you create on-the-spot custom tricks that you perform instantly. Make this app uniquely yours and put it to work in entertaining ways.
