ΓÇÿEmpty EstateΓÇÖ is the follow-up EP to the critically acclaimed ΓÇ£NocturneΓÇ¥, which received several year-end accolades including album of the year in Under The Radar and iTunes. The 7-song EP was recorded in Brooklyn at GaryΓÇÖs Electric by Al Carlson in January. The love of dreamy, fuzzy, handcrafted guitar-pop isn't far removed from the Radio Dept. or The Pains Of Being Pure at Heart, but they display a more comprehensive and widespread commitment to classic indie pop sound. Revivalism notwithstanding, the craftsmanship is undeniable and the details are spot-on.
