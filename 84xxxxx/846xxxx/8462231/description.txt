A collection of 22 projects--most very practical--are presented in this delightful book. There's an emphasis on bags of various sorts, from a cute ladybug coin purse, an iPad cover and an e-reader case to an over-the-shoulder messenger bag and the simple but stylish tote bag shown on the front cover. There are also instructions for several lap quilts and some useful sewing accessories. The "jackalope" shown on the cover is the only softie included. The instructions are clear, there are lots of diagrams and each project is shown in several photographs taken from different angles. This combination means you are much more likely to understand exactly what's required and enjoy success in crafting your own version of these projects.
