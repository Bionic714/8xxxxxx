Wade Bowen The Given CD coverItΓÇÖs hard to think of an accomplishment Wade Bowen has not achieved on the Texas music scene. HeΓÇÖs won the awards, sells out his shows, plays all the big festivals, and has recorded a ΓÇ£Live at Billy BobΓÇÖs TexasΓÇ¥ CD. ItΓÇÖs been a road of steady progress since WadeΓÇÖs 2002 debut album ΓÇ£Try Not To ListenΓÇ¥. Like with any musician, this requires some luck, but credit BowenΓÇÖs work ethic, talent, and the fact that he is a really good guy for most of his career success.

Now, with the release of ΓÇ£The GivenΓÇ¥, Bowen has made the next logical step in growing his music and signed with Nashville label BNA. His 2008 album ΓÇ£If We Ever Make It HomeΓÇ¥ cracked the US Country Top 30, and ΓÇ£Billy BobΓÇÖsΓÇ¥ peaked at #41, without a lot of national promotion. So it only makes sense that Wade take his Texas music to the country.

I always thought of Wade Bowen as too melodic a singer and too much of a cerebral songwriter to be a country music artist, but the new CD has a sound thatΓÇÖs got just a little bit more country flavor. Compared to WadeΓÇÖs previous albums, the steel guitar is more prominent throughout ΓÇ£The GivenΓÇ¥. There are several songs, when I hear the lyrics and music, I say to myself, ΓÇ£that song could be a mainstream country hitΓÇ¥.ΓÇ¥You AinΓÇÖt Got MeΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£Say AnythingΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£All ThatΓÇÖs LeftΓÇ¥, and the rock-country tune ΓÇ£Beat Me DownΓÇ¥ are all catchy enough to appeal to a national country audience.

But donΓÇÖt think for a second that Bowen is compromising his roots for the sparkly things of Nashville. I think itΓÇÖs safe to say WadeΓÇÖs not going to change who he is. As proof, ΓÇ£Saturday NightΓÇ¥ already hit #1 on Texas charts. The latest single, ΓÇ£To Live Is To FlyΓÇ¥, is a song written by Texas songwriter Townes Van Zandt and features another Texas legend, Guy Clark. This song alone sends the message that Wade Bowen clearly appreciates the fan base he has in the Lone Star State.

ΓÇ£The GivenΓÇ¥ is undeniably a Wade Bowen CD, featuring plenty of WadeΓÇÖs cerebral lyrics and edgy rock riffs. Bowen writes or co-writes every song but ΓÇ£To Live Is To FlyΓÇ¥, and if youΓÇÖve listened to the progress each of his albums have made musically and lyrically over the past decade, this CD should come as no surprise to you whatsoever. Just like the artist himself, ΓÇ£The GivenΓÇ¥ is high quality, unique, and will make Texas Wade Bowen fans happy.

I think itΓÇÖs safe to raise the bar and expect a new level of success for Wade Bowen with the release of ΓÇ£The GivenΓÇ¥. Only time will tell just how much success, but Wade seems to have the personality, work ethic, and talent to do just about anything he sets out to accomplish.
