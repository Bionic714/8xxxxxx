Book Description

Brian Boitano has traveled all over the world for skating competitions, and he is fascinated with other cultures and their cuisine. He now finds the same deep fulfillment in cooking and entertaining that he once found in skating.

His adventures abroad influence his own style of cooking, as does his Italian heritage, where great food has always been a key part of any gathering. Some of BoitanoΓÇÖs favorite food memories revolve around family get-togethers, and his cookbook includes personal vignettes and dishes that are inspired by memorable family recipes.

The recipes in What Would Brian Boitano Make? emphasize taste, convenience, and nutrition. Boitano pairs intriguing flavors and textures, playing with the balance of opposites to add complexity to his recipes.

While gourmet in taste, the ingredients are easily accessible to any home cook. Mouthwatering recipes include: Paella Sliders, Crab-and-Avocado Crostini, Blood Orange Mojito, Butternut Squash Soup with Goat Cheese Toasts, Heirloom Tomato Cantaloupe and Feta Salad, Summer Squash Risotto with Grilled Lemon Basil Chicken, Pork Tenderloin with Warm Plum Salsa, Salmon with Pea and Basil Pesto, and Coconut Flan.
