We continue our study through Revelation 1 as John writes to the seven churches. We read how peace follows grace, and consider the justness, mercy and graciousness of God. Grow in a Biblical understanding of the Trinity, remembering we are as unto the Lord.

Athey Creek Christian Fellowship is a body of believers in Wilsonville Oregon desiring to know the Lord in an ever-increasing measure. We are a non- denominational fellowship associating with all who are in the Body of Christ.
