
Open your Bible as we continue reading through the seven churches in Revelation 2-3. Here we study a timely lesson from the church in Sardis, and consider the church today. Hold on as we run through a list of major historical events throughout the church age. May we be those who are watchful, ready and steady in the ways of Jesus.
