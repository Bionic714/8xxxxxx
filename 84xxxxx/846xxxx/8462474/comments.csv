TimeSplitters 1 emulates well, but graphics are more like high end PS1 with no major flaws.

TimeSplitters 2 emulates perfectly with crystal clear graphics with no flaws.

TimeSplitters 3 emulates ok, but has graphics issues & needs a decent graphics card to maintain a good frame rate. This game has some issues with in game tasks, ie: at one stage you need to use a crane to take out a turret on a boat, but the image is completely scrambled when using the crane, so going off the controls & viewing manually is the way out of that, but apart from that, it's worth checking out all 3 games which are all here on TPB, enjoy & seed if you can, cheers."

The game works perfectly on a mediocre rig, so if you're going to use your PC for gaming, get a gaming PC, not a little tin pot office job."
