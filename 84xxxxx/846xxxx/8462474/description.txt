TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter video game. It was released for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox game consoles in October 2002 in North America, Europe and Japan. It is the second game in the TimeSplitters series, and a sequel to the original TimeSplitters.

The player assumes the role of one of two space marines as they attempt to stop the alien race of TimeSplitters from ruining history by collecting the time crystals in various time periods, ranging from the Wild West to the 25th century. 

This is a PS2 game (NTSC) that has nice graphics on PS2 console, but excellent graphics on PC.
Use the LilyPad plugin to setup your gamepad, or keyboard & mouse configuration.

NOTE: by default, in the General section of LilyPad, the mouse is disabled.

This game is much better played on PC than PS2 because:

A) It has flawless emulation when used on a reasonable PC.
B) You can use gampad or keyboard & mouse.
C) Graphics on PC blow the console graphics away.
D) ISO files don't scratch.

PCSX2 v 1.0 + Plugins & bios files included; so all you need to play this on PC is included.

My working setup picures are included also. Approx 4.5 gig of hard drive is required.

My recommended system requirements:

OS: XP + SP3 / Vista / Windows 7.
CPU: Core 2 duo 2.4 or better.
GeForce 8400 or better.
