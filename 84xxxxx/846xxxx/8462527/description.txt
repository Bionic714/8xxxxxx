How are you, old friend? If youΓÇÖre reading this, then it worked. I only hope you can still forgive me.

WeΓÇÖve never seen eye to eye on my research, but you must put such things behind you. You are the only one to whom I can turn. You must come at once, for we are all in great peril. I trust you remember the house? My study is the highest room.

Press forward with heart. There is no way back now.

AS.
