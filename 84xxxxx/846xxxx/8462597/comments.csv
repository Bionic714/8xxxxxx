,L01ter,2013-05-12T05:59Z,Agreed with papayrus.
,Breaksense,2013-05-12T19:39Z,You must be idiot to pay 27 euros when there are infinite invite keys...
,spidey2033,2013-05-13T03:57Z,"To those dont know words like ""appreciate"".. could you shut the helll upss??!! nobody ask you to download.. thanks to uploader.. keep it up"
,papayrus,2013-05-13T20:49Z,To spidey I don't appreciate it it's weird and senseless why upload a game that's free? I don't appreciate the one who uploaded it as well because he refuses to explain what this crap is all about. Looks to me more like someone got into someone elses account and this torrent is probably not even uploaded by the pink skull user here and if it is then maybe he should not have a skull. @vada you must be a little 12 year year old autistic boy because normal people people don't just pop there dick heads up out of nowhere for no good reason and talk the shit you talk only autistic children do that.
,Angertek,2013-05-19T16:02Z,I'm sorry but i don't see how this is free. If you going to complain about upload at least please provide a link to the free download.
