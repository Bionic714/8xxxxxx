This is the ISO of the windows version of the only MegaTen game on PC.
At the beginning of the game, you take the exam to become a Devil Buster. Then you must talk to all your friends in the shelter. Aterwards, you get the results of the test (which you pass of course). Go tell the good news to all your friends. Then you can come back to your room and choose to rest (Σ╝æπéÇ) to save.
Beware that this game contains some explicit scenes and is entirely in Japanese.

Though it's really strange, the game stores the save files in the "C:WINDOWS" folder under the name "save00##.dds".
