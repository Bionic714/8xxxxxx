ItΓÇÖs hard to stand out from the crowd these days, but Leeds based Jay Leighton does by the virtue of having the knack of penning killer tunes. Keywords that describe this album best are ΓÇÿaddictiveΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿmeaningfulΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿheartfeltΓÇÖ, and ΓÇÿmellowΓÇÖ. Standout tracks are ΓÇÿHappiness and Good IntentionsΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿAvalancheΓÇÖ; simply beautiful and I defy anyone into this genre of music not to be moved.
For best results Jay Leighton is best served up loud on headphones, late at night.

Jay Leighton began his music career in 2008 with a major label deal for his band Buffalo ΓÇÖ77. The trio, fronted by Jay, quickly gained momentum and signed to Island Records, only to part ways with the label and split as a band before their debut album could be released. Disillusioned with the music industry and all it had to offer, Jay considered quitting music altogether, but soon found himself back in the studio recording solo mini-album ΓÇÿPolaroids & StillsΓÇÖ. Following festivals and live shows all over the world, including dates with cult band Lamb. Jay released his full-length debut (ΓÇÿAs the Sun Comes UpΓÇÖ) in spring 2011.
