One of the most aggressively laid-back singer-songwriters youΓÇÖll ever encounter, Peter Bradley AdamsΓÇÖ fourth album, Between Us is long on craft and feeling. At times reminiscent of fellow troubadours Joshua James and Joshua Radin and perhaps a more pop-oriented and less hardboiled Lyle Lovett, Adams remains very firmly his own man via cuts such as ΓÇ£My Love Is My LoveΓÇ¥ (sure to be a favorite on satellite and public radio) and ΓÇ£Be Still My Heart.ΓÇ¥

If Between Us lacks a broad sonic palette and at times seems too anything, thatΓÇÖs probably just seem par for the course. Adams is cut from the same cloth as the likes of Jackson Browne, one of those rare writers who oozes sincerity even if that sincerity at times becomes a bit much. Adams is a rare and admirable talent and Between Us is a welcome addition to the singer-songwriterΓÇÖs circle.
