The Black Swans know heartbreak firsthand. While the Ohio-based mope-rockers have always taken a decidedly sullen approach to things, the death of founding member and violin player Noel Sayre just before the Fourth of July in 2008 gave the bandΓÇÖs distressed songwriting something tangible to latch onto. Occasion For Song, the bandΓÇÖs fifth full-length album and first post-Sayre, is a heart-on-sleeve memorial to The Black SwansΓÇÖ fallen bandmate. ItΓÇÖs also the bandΓÇÖs most shatteringly personal offering to date.

SayreΓÇÖs death glues the recordΓÇÖs nine tracks together, and the band isnΓÇÖt shy about laying all that hurt on the table. Track by track, thoughts and musings on SayreΓÇÖs death loom, and the bandΓÇÖs hushed, delicate music, an effective hybrid of indie-folk, dream pop, and sadcore, is the perfect companion to the recordΓÇÖs bleak subject matter. Like Neil Young (a notable influence here) on classic ΓÇÖ70s albums like Zuma and TonightΓÇÖs The Night, The Black Swans prove here that even the bleakest of circumstances can build the foundation for some beautiful music.

Lyrically, frontman Jerry DeCiccaΓÇÖs words range from the cryptic and enigmatic to those with all the subtlety of a kick to the teeth, but either way thereΓÇÖs little escaping the matter at hand. From album opener ΓÇ£Basket of LightΓÇ¥ (ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs been a long while/ Since IΓÇÖve seen you smile/ I want to feel your warmth againΓÇ¥) to ΓÇ£Bound To BeΓÇ¥ (ΓÇ£What do you do when the dark is too dark to see?ΓÇ¥) to ΓÇ£Portsmouth, OhioΓÇ¥, which lays much of SayreΓÇÖs tragic story bare (ΓÇ£NobodyΓÇÖs supposed to die/ Three days before the Fourth of July/ Especially while the sun is still in the skyΓÇ¥), Occasion For Song is an open book. While many songwriters tuck their thoughts away in layers of allusion and metaphor, The Black Swans win here braving the misery head-on.
