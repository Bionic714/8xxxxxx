Fraser Anderson has recently released his third album, Little Glass Box. The Scotland-born singer-songwriter learned his trade amongst the Scottish Folk scene, performing with Dougie MacLean as a vocalist and supporting Joan Armatrading, The Low Anthem and Chuck Berry in concerts around Britain and France.

Now based in France, FraserΓÇÖs album, Little Glass Box, is a retro folk-soul exploration recorded with world class musicians Danny Thompson on double bass (John Martyn, Nick Drake), Dick Pearce on trumpet (Ronnie Scott Quintet), Martin Ditcham on percussion (Sade) and Max Middleton on Rhodes piano (Jeff Beck, John Martyn). The result is an album that is sensitive and mature, crafted with a lyrical and melodic honesty.
