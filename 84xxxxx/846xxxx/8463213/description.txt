AUDIO - SPECIAL FRiEND


Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....

Ok heres our v2....mainly done because some sites won't allow videos with the logos on show
so went back and redid the lot so more users could get this :)
Video has now been cleaned up really nice aswell as having all the extra footage removed ( where there was
no english audio ).
Also blurred all the watermarks that move,aswell as cutting the intro with the website on it.

Audio as been remastered and resyncd so should be pretty close to bang on.
The video at times will look like it skips quickly but on some of the extra footage they rechanged the whole
scene so you could have had 30 secs english 40 secs chinese then 5 secs english ....
So cut it the best i could and after checking ...i'm pleased with it so.

Enjoy till line comes folks ....
