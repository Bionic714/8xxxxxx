It's BBC"

As it says above the commentary during the qualifying is from Sky F1. Before that the small show is by Greg Dust. 

The commentary IS from Sky F1. Please watch before you make wrong comments."
,scurrg,2013-05-11T22:06Z,If this is Sky then why do the screens show BBC commentators Gary Anderson and Lee Mckenzie with their BBC Microphones?
,hinterland,2013-05-11T22:07Z,thx
,crazzzycannnuk,2013-05-11T22:08Z,"This is NOT SKY f1, This is ONE, which is Australian. good download if you just want the Quali though here's there webpage http://one.com.au/"

Sorry about that, accidently added screens from the wrong Torrent. The quality of the video in this torrent is much better and the commentary during qualifying is from Sky F1 with Martin Brundle. A small show in the beginning is from an Australian presenter."
,IAMH67,2013-05-11T22:13Z,"@crazzzycannnuk

Fast forward to when the qualifying starts, it is Sky commentary. 

It is exactly what it says in the description. Why do I have to repeat it over and over again?

THE COMMENTARY FOR THE QUALIFYING IS FROM SKY WITH MARTIN BRUNDLE AND DAVID CROFT. THE SMALL SHOW IN THE BEGINNING IS FROM ONE WHICH IS AN AUSTRALIAN CHANNEL. 

It says this in the description and I've already repeated it so many times. What is so difficult to understand?"
,myukis,2013-05-11T23:01Z,"I'd imagine the hard part is that most people don't read the whole thing. Your very first sentence says (I'm paraphrasing, because people who don't read it all do paraphrase in their minds) ""commentary... is from Sky F1..."" The problem is there's a few different uploaders who vary from Sky to GloboTV to BBC to FoxSports and so on, and most people ONLY want to see all SkyF1. It's not that we don't appreciate the efforts, we're just pretty particular about who should do commentary (I watched BBC in 2011, followed Brundle to SkyF1 which is a richer experience than the rest).

I suppose if you're looking for how to handle it going forward, I'd lead off with ""NOTICE: This is not 100% sky, only the quali commentary is Sky. The rest is Australian One channel."" I didn't even know what you meant by ""local commentary"" as you didn't indicate what that meant through the whole description.

As for the whole preference thing, some people like the first broadcast or even first english broadcast they can get their hands on, others hold out for Sky F1. I'm the kind who will hold out for Sky. I even stopped watching practice because it's very hard to find a regular and reliable source of Sky F1 for FP1/2/3, and it was eating up 4 hours of view time + 1-3 hours of ""find torrent"" time out of my weekends."

Thanks to the seeders too."

You wrote ""NOTICE: This is not 100% sky, only the quali commentary is Sky. ""

I wrote ""The commentary during qualifying is from Sky F1""

Then I wrote "" Local commentary by Greg Rust, Daryl Beattie""

Then to top it all off I wrote a third time ""full Qualifying including LOCAL buildup""

If telling you 3 times doesn't explain it then I don't know what will.

Let me tell you the real reason people have this problem including you. You don't read the description even though I have the most detailed descriptions you will find out of all the F1 uploaders. 

You just glance over the description, see ""Sky F1"" written a couple of times and don't bother reading further. Then you download the Torrent and see a One logo pop up and freak out coming here saying its the wrong torrent. Then you guys see that the description mentions this show and the commentary from Sky starts in 20 minutes and that the uploader has wrote it 3 times in the description and 3 times in the comments as well, you realize you made a mistake and most of you then don't even bother coming back and admitting it. 

Others (like you) instead come here blaming me who takes the time to upload F1 torrents faster than anyone on here just to help you guys watch it. I get the race on TV and have no reason to upload it, nor do I earn anything or promote anything from it. 

Please stop being such inept idiots and making a fool out of yourself. Even while making that comment you didn't read the description and 'paraphrased'. 

This is the qualifying session 1h40 minutes worth of video in such a great size, uploaded in under an hour after it aired with ads edited out and the most in depth description you will find if you compare it to any other F1 torrent and still you are idiotic enough to blame me for your incompetence just because you couldn't take the time to read the description.

Please save me the lecture or instruct me, I know what I'm doing. In the future if you can kindly read the description then do yourself a favor and save yourself this embarrassment, or you can get torrents from somewhere else after waiting an additional 4 hours.

I suppose I should let you know that I was not in any way complaining, but rather offering at least my opinion of why everyone has this problem. More or less answering the last bit of your previous reply, ""What is so difficult to understand?"" in a rational response. For me personally, I did read it all, and eventually did interpolate that it was only Sky for the live commentary itself, no Sky pre-build up, no sky post show. I didn't find a better option and watched yours and found that they even cut away from the Sky commentary inbetween the 3 Quali sessions. I did read it, but my post was explaining why most do not get it: because they do NOT read it. If they read ANYTHING, it would be the first sentence only, which is a little ambiguous for those who are not looking for it. Yes, they are idiots. They're not even worth your time to respond to. Please stop lumping me in with them. They are the same idiots who would not even read the comments, even if they posted one they would not come back for a reply. Idiots such as this are not WORTH responding to. So I suppose if I was offering anything it was constructive criticism, suggesting perhaps slightly better wording. If you were to take one more piece of advice, I would suggest the following: don't waste your time feeding the trolls. If people post stupid comments, realize that they will likely never come back to see your reply and save yourself the time of thinking it up. :)

Sincerely,

Someone who does read, does take the time to come back and read replies, and did recognize that you were giving some indicators that it was not fully Sky F1."
