,ChingaTuu,2013-05-11T20:06Z,"...And thanks once again to Mothra for yet another member of the Freedom Fighters. I'll be seeding this one, as well as the Ray and Uncle Sam collections he's posted thru the weekend. If there's enough demand I'll keep them going at more than a trickle for a few more days to help everyone out.

Lessee...there's the Human Bomb, and we did Firebrand lats week, and Doll Man was done a while back, right? Guess that leaves Phantom Lady and Red Bee, but nobody wants Phantom Lady unless it's the original pencils, as it's common knowledge she was drawn nekked and it was the inker who drew those lines that make up her ""costume""...:P :P :P :P

Hey, wasn't Air Wave also done a month or two ago, come to think of it? I know while Max Mercury was big in ""Impulse"", there was a ""Quicksilver"" collection being floated around Usenet, but never did see it here. Might try to see if I can find the disk it's backed up on and upload it..."
,kreeonk33,2013-05-11T20:17Z,Great job as usual thanks!
,Mothra67,2013-05-11T20:50Z,"I have done Phantom Lady a long time ago, one of my first Uploads.  so that leaves Red Bee and Human Bomb, but they will have to wait, I am still working on my Project Superpowers thing, and have the target, V-Man, American Eagle, Dynamic man, Yellow Jacket, The Liborator, Silver Streak and The Mask still to UL!  so I hope you don't mind waiting a bit"
,estetheo,2013-05-12T18:41Z,"Could someone please seed I have been at 78% for a little over a day.

Thanks"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-12T23:20Z,"...I'm planning on taking up the seeding, but I still don't have a complete download to seed from. Mothra? Can you put  your seed back up and let the throttle go wide open for a bit? I'll keep this one up for a few extra days to help out with the seeding!"
,llaney1,2013-05-14T10:25Z,It's 5/14 and still stalled at 78 %. Is everything okay Mothra?
