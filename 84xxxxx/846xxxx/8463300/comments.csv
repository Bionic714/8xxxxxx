Last season there was a uploader that did all the qually and races with pre and post shows from Sky... now all I can find is BBC... if you look around there are a lot of people that are searching for an uploader like that again.  You'd be the only one out there providing decent commentary and race/qualification for all us F1 fans living abroad that cannot get it anywhere else!

Pretty Pleeeeeeeeease!!"

Would be great to have Pre/Post quality and race"
