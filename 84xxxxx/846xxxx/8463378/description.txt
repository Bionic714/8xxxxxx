"ItΓÇÖs a sad state of affairs when the fact that a rock & roll album recorded live, with minimal overdubs, is considered worth highlighting, but itΓÇÖs notable that the new full-length from Thomas Wynn & the Believers was recorded ΓÇ£as live as possible.ΓÇ¥ Had Wynn reshaped his band ΓÇô one of the most incandescent beacons of rock & roll classicism in Orlando ΓÇô into some Pro Tools-contorted beast, the resulting work wouldΓÇÖve been not only a disservice to the transcendent nature of their live performances, it wouldΓÇÖve also been profoundly disappointing and dishonest. Yet, thanks to a simple and straightforward approach to the recording process, Brothers and Sisters is full of buzzing, open-chord goodness, crackling harmonies and visceral energy to spare. 

"What Wynn and the Believers deliver is a sly bit of surprise. Their workmanlike ethos and general ubiquity ΓÇô seldom a week goes by without a gig of some sort ΓÇô has likely lulled local scene-watchers into thinking they know exactly what the deal is here: classic rock delivered with roof-raising spirit and a crowd-friendly smile. But there are also subtle variations on the 40-year-old form, tweaks that are much more recognizable on record than on stage. 

"For instance, the title track unfolds gradually and gracefully into a CCR-quoting number that seems like an awfully unoriginal way to begin a record. However, ΓÇ£Brothers and SistersΓÇ¥ reveals itself as much more complex, using a Fogerty riff as little more than a launchpad for a soulful, cathartic and completely original rocker. 

"ItΓÇÖs that soulfulness that continues to set WynnΓÇÖs band apart from many road-dogging young classic-rock acts. Live, itΓÇÖs the grit in WynnΓÇÖs voice, the generosity of his spirit and the bandΓÇÖs visible camaraderie that helps to elevate the BelieversΓÇÖ music beyond mundane recitations of worn-out ΓÇÖ60s rock tropes. On the album, thanks to the live-to-tape ethos of the sessions, all of that comes across beautifully." Jason Ferguson/Orlando Weekly
