,Ziggy2by2,2013-05-14T21:29Z,I don't get what you are saying. I'm sorry
,KatSucks,2013-05-15T00:53Z,"He or she is probably concerned about not being able to access the site.  Best bet, while Ziggy my not be uploading to other sites, would be to take the torrent hash and drop it into google.  This site gets mirrored by a large number of other sites.  Google'ing for the hash will show you what other sites wind up with these torrents.  hope this helps"
