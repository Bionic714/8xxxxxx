What's cool about it:
Includes the FREE DLC "The Bulgarian Colossus" where you can recruit the boxing legend, Jan Koloff, and receive a new weapon, the Ispolin Fists.
Conquer a historically accurate Atlantic City with 20 unique districts featuring real-world landmarks in a story-driven campaign or sandbox freeplay game.
Strategic real-time gameplay for planning coups, expanding your territory, extorting the competition, and bribing the authorities.
Lead your henchmen into elaborately planned turn-based tactical combat as you pull off bank heists, robberies, street battles, and more.
Overview:
o·mer·ta (-mûrt, mr-tä) - A rule or code that prohibits speaking or divulging information about the activities of a criminal organization.

Bug-eyed Bettys are making a racket with “lips that touch wine, won’t kiss mine” and not minding their own beeswax. The fuzz are busy closing down the local juice joints and pouring perfectly good spirits down the drain. All this fuss about liquor sure can drive a man to drink. It isn’t easy to wet one’s whistle but there some bootleggers who are always happy to provide as long as you got the scratch.

Omerta: City of Gangsters puts you into the boots of a fresh-from-the-boat immigrant with dreams of the big life. Work your way up the criminal hierarchy of 1920’s Atlantic City, starting with small jobs, recruiting new gang members and expanding your empire by taking territory from other mobsters. Establish your own crime syndicate and become the de facto ruler of Atlantic City!
