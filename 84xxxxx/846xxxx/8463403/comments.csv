,noobnak,2013-05-13T14:04Z,"try to extract with Unarchiver
here is the link:http://the-unarchiver.en.softonic.com/mac"
,mjchch,2013-05-13T15:11Z,"@noobnak, the extract works. But when I click the icon, it just pop up and dismiss. Can't play it. I reset my Mac and it still the same problem. How can I solve this?

,noobnak,2013-05-13T15:52Z,"@mjchch, try to click it many times"
,noobnak,2013-05-13T16:06Z,"@mjchch, or go back to your torrent client and right click on Tomb Raider torrent and chose 
FORCE RE-CHECK.
-un-zip the file with ARCHIVE UTILITY:)"
,mjchch,2013-05-13T16:50Z,"@noobnak, I have force re-check. I have clicked it many time, but it won't play. As soon I clicked the game, it just directly dismissed. :("
,noobnak,2013-05-13T17:29Z,"@mjchch
right click on the game and chose show package contents
-double click on WINESKIN and chose SET SCREEN OPTIONS
-enable ""use mac driver instead of X11""(right side)
-Quit and launch the game"
,noobnak,2013-05-13T18:10Z,sorry for my english
,sophie333,2013-05-13T20:27Z,"hello, thanks for the upload, but i'm afraid there are several problems:

1) the game could not be archived with any other program than The Unarchiver (but i finally managed to unzip the game in applications);

2) I changed the screen settings in Wineskin and enabled the following option: ''Use Mac Driver instead of X11'' - nothing happens, the game doesn't even pop up.

3) in case i disable the above mentioned option and enable override, the game pops up, but then a black screen appears and the game crashes.

Therefore, could you please explain the proper screen settings for Wineskin (including override settings - if required, what other options to enable etc.)

thanks again"
,sophie333,2013-05-13T20:34Z,"noobnak, did you receive my previous comment?"
,mycophage,2013-05-14T02:12Z,"noobnak, thanks for the directions. They're not working for me, but I'm posting here to see whether others have had similar problems 

As others have indicated, Archive Utility fails to uncompress the archive. 

Unarchiver seems to work, in that it creates a normal-looking application. This app fails to launch. When I attempt to Show Package Contents, the Wineskin app initially indicated that it was corrupted (I can't reproduce the exact error message; now it just bounces and fails to launch).

Anyone else having similar problems? Any idea about how to fix them?

I'll try uncompressing the file again, just to see if that works, but I'm not optimistic."
,mjchch,2013-05-14T02:48Z,"@noobnak, nothing works for the suggestion. After I clicked the icon, it just dismissed without even bouncing (the icon). I have tried to re-extract the file three times and all can't be played."

,noobnak,2013-05-14T15:21Z,I will try to fix this and re-upload as soon as I can
,mjchch,2013-05-14T16:55Z,"@noobnak, looking forward for the re-upload version.
Many thanks."
,mycophage,2013-05-14T22:22Z,"Indeed - many thanks to noobnak for the initial post, for being so responsive to questions, and (in advance) for the re-upload. You're awesome!"
