Entire fifth song (Darkangel) and the better part of next one (Illusion) are missing from the recording, I pressed some button when I was detaching audio recorder from my camera and didn't notice it for a while. Sorry about this, it will teach me to use the "hold" switch ;)

Caution: sample rate and duration do not match CDDA standard!

Video recording of several songs is available on YouTube, you can check the audio quality there - just look for my channel, I have the same username there (parafinSpobs).
