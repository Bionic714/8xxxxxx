The Duke Robillard Band - 2013 - Independently Blue

Undoubtedly one of DukeΓÇÖs finest blues albums, this set owes much to the musicians present on these sides (Bruce Bears on piano and Hammond organ, Brad Hallen on bass, Mark Teixeira on drums), all of whom have developed a common language with Duke over the years. Monster Mike Welch also brings a crucial touch to Independently Blue, appearing on all tracks (some of which he also signed). Such high levels of musicianship and sound quality are sure to put all electric blues lovers in a trance!
