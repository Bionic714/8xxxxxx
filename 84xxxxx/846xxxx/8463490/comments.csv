,Ahlat,2013-05-12T07:55Z,Thank you for the reup. Though I must ask again is this a scanlation or an actual english translated version?

I am not entirely sure. The website says that all of their mangas are scanlations. But, the entry for GTO says that they are in the process of scanning the volumes. So, I'm thinking these scans are from the actual Tokyopop volumes."
