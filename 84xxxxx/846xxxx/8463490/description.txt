(Reup of previous upload. I screwed my previous upload up. I found a tutorial and, hopefully, this torrent will work.)

Eikichi Onizuka is a 22-year-old high school dropout in need of some direction. He has a black belt in karate, a Kawasaki bike, a porn collection and a habit of squatting at the bottom of escalators so he can look up skirts. Not an obvious choice for the moniker "Great Teacher." But the seemingly unlikely premise of this manga is that these qualities are precisely what will make Onizuka a success. He might be misguided-he wants to become a teacher so he can meet young, impressionable high-school hotties-but his struggles to find a path to adulthood through the wilds of hormones and violent impulses are not unsympathetic. 

In fact, the book is wildly popular and has been made into a Japanese live-action TV drama, a film and an anime series. Tokyopop's English-language version remains faithful to the Japanese original, reading from back to front and from left to right. The drawings are serviceable, with comically dead-on depictions of sweaty-faced guys in various stages of anguish, surprise or shock. 

*I did not scan the books. I ripped them from the spectrum nexus website.

**I zipped the images and then converted them to .cbz files. I then imported the files into comicrack and scraped them with the comicvine scraper. If you add the books to comicrack, all of the metadata should already be there for you.

***There are 25 volumes. I will upload the remaining as soon as possible.
