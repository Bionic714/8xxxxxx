Documentary about Sybila Arredondo Guevara, Jose Maria Arguedas's widow, who was convicted to 15 years of prison for acts of terrorism as a lead member of Shinning Path, Sendero Luminoso.

"I remember the night when the history of my family changed. We received a phone call from Peru saying that my aunt Sibila was in prison accused of forming part of the Shining Path. I was seven years old and my parent's protective silence made me transform her image into a great mystery. She was kept in prision for 15 years. Today she is free and I want to get close to her, to listen and to understand."
