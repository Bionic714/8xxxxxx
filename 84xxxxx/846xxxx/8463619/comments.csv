You're either having trouble typing ""Doctor Who"" correctly or there's something a bit spotty about the search function here on TPB.

I'm able to find all of the other episodes, but it *does* seem more difficult than it was before."

,Sideswift,2013-05-12T05:03Z,Why the sudden drop in filesize? Shorter episode?
,sharkcutter,2013-05-12T06:26Z,File size also relates to changes in image. My guess is in this one not much happens.
