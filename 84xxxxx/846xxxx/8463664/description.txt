This is the 2011 Vidya Gaem Awards master file that was uploaded to YouTube (this is the uncensored version with the Chris-Chan segment).

The /v/GAs (Vidya Gaem Awards) were born in early December 2011 as a response to the Spike VGAs, which were worse than anybody could have predicted and an insult to the entire gaming industry.
A small group of anon decided that instead of just bitching, they could do something about it. The result: an award show with no budget, no skill and no hope that it would get anywhere. Created and run based entirely on the feedback of /v/, the /v/GAs are a way to recognize both the best and the worst that the gaming industry has to offer, and to have a bit of fun while doing so.

The first annual Vidya Gaem Awards show, as hosted by Duke and a very special guest! Enjoy and learn more about the /v/GAs at http://vidyagaemawards.com/
