A quarter of the way into 2013, the 2012 /v/GAs were finally finished, streamed and now uploaded. There are way too many people to thank personally in this description, but it couldn't have been done without all our voice actors, skit submitters and behind-the-scenes crew. Check out the credits page on the website for the full details, and the winners page if you don't feel like watching over 90 minutes of this shit just to see who won the actual awards.
