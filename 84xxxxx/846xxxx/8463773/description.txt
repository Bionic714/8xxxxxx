A quarter of the way into 2013, the 2012 /v/GAs were finally finished, streamed and now uploaded. There are way too many people to thank personally in this description, but it couldn't have been done without all our voice actors, skit submitters and behind-the-scenes crew.

This "Condensed Cut" was made by the producer of the show with the crew's blessing. It cuts down on over 20 minutes of skits that may have stretched the show out too long. It also adds plenty of new content made just for this edition, all made by the original cast and crew of the show.
