2800 kbps bitrate!!! wow,amazing man.."
,jalucian,2013-05-12T08:14Z,"Yeah, it's a short movie, so the file size didn't suffer from it. Movies that have a lot of grain due to the type of film they were shot on require higher bitrates to right, because grain EATS bits. I use 2250 for normal, modern, non-grainy 1080p sources and 2800kbps for high grain. I increased my normal bitrate on Beasts of the Southern Wild, Clerks, and Pi because they were all high-grain as well. This is something I don't see other encoders doing, and they should be."
