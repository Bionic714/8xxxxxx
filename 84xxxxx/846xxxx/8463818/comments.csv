It's a hacked and modified copy.

It doesn't work but it does manage to empty the balance on your phone"

Hey dude, are you crazy or what?

Do you ever heard of WhatsApp PLUS, do you know what it is? Search with google and you'll find out.

First, I've downloaded this and it's working great.

Second, this does nothing with your ""balance"", it works just like the one that you find in Google Play.

Third, for your information, the latest version of WhatsApp for Android is 2.9.6917. 

So, stop posting fake info here."
,phasar,2013-05-12T21:59Z,"First, Asshole, I cut n pasted the current version info for WhatsApp PLUS from google play

second, it did not work on my phone and my balance was wiped out

third, if the current version is 2.9.6917.  as you say, how do you explain this version being v3.35?"
