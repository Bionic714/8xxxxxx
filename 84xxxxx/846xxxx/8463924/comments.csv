,Novsann,2013-05-11T23:10Z,Thankk you
,PedroSSM,2013-05-11T23:48Z,"Hi Footy. Thanks so much for your uploads of Formula 1. I usually see the SKY versions you used to upload. I really hate the BBC commentaries. Please continue to upload the SKY Versions. Prefer Martin Brundle, Ted's book to the BBC commentators.
PS: I don't need the HD versions. I prefer the low gigas versions. THANKS SO MUCH. Waiting for the Sky Versions."
,rc90029,2013-05-12T03:11Z,"^^^^^^^^^

SKY coverage is far superior that BBC.  Will be waiting for the ultra smooth 50fps HD version. 

Thanks Footy!! Ur the MAN"
,EdoSensei,2013-05-12T06:13Z,"I'm definitely with reiberkuchen on this one. 

That Sky presenter is AWFUL and most of the others are pretty average. Admittedly Brundle was a loss for the BBC, Ted to a lesser degree. However, the Sky coverage doesn't compare. Have Sky been awarded for their coverage of F1 last season? Not to my knowledge, whereas the BBC were the year before.

Either way, none of us are paying for this so I'm happy with either. When there's a choice then great!"
