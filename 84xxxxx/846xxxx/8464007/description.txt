  RP is the quintessential good guy,         
  and even if he plays the key role          
  of Raavan in the popular stage play        
  ΓÇÿRaavan LeelaΓÇÖ, his values echo those      
  of Ram. He is always ready to help         
  people in need, often at the cost of       
  his own comfort. One night as RP is        
  on his way to meet his long term           
  girlfriend Chitra, he comes across         
  Mandar Lele, who is distraught and         
  lonely.
