This is the entire discography for Shooting Star.  All but three of these discs are my rip; Leap of Faith, Circles and Live From Cinncinnati (which is only ripped at 192) were downloaded from the web many years ago but are quality rips @320.  All my discs were ripped in their entirety in mp3 @320 (Fuk flac).  The files are properly tagged with covers.  I scanned the covers and saved them in multiple resolutions from full to as low as 500 x 500.  There are duplicate songs within this compilation so you can pick and choose which ones to download.
