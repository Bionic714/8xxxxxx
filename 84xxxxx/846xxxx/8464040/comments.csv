Fully sorted by patch order and release date.

This ensures a perfect game, without any patch conflicts.

Here are some pictures of the Installation Guide included in the torrent.

The guide is very clean and strict on how to install the game and its expansion packs:

This torrent is over 60GB filesize because it includes ALL the Expansions plus ALL the Stuff Packs released, so far! So please don't complain to me about its filesize - this is inevitable.
The Sims 3 became a pretty big game, now, with all those 10+ expansions that have been released so far!

I will keep seeding 7/24. Have nice Simming! "

Check your Hard Drive's space. Go to My Computer and check the condition of your Hard Drive the archive file is located at.
Make sure it isn't full.

@ alliqat:
Use System Restore. Is the best and safest way to restore your system to the pre-installation condition. Also check on internet for your case.
There are lots of people who are unable to install/uninstall the game properly.
I am not a technician, dunno how to help with this. Sims 3 is a game where things can really go wrong. This is EA's fault for making its Installation so complex and flawed. :("
,alliqat,2013-05-18T01:42Z,"I did figure it out in the end :) I had to do a manual uninstall, a bit of a pain but it worked.

A System Restore is more reliable than a manual uninstallation and you couldn't have had any issues reinstalling WA after a System Restore-based uninstallation."

Oh, are you from France or US? Heard that these 2 countries have some notorious laws which allow the companies to send 3 warnings to you for downloading torrents. In the 3rd time, they ban your internet connection.

But I can't do anything about this. Some countries just have ridiculous laws (blame the politicians who are bribed by the companies). I myself have legally purchased the Sims 3 games before I gift them to my sis, and so this torrent is legal. If you have legally bought Sims 3, you can try complain to the company to null the warning they have sent to you, as the warning, according to the law, is valid for people who are not paying the game they use."

Why you seek here for technical support about issues in the game? You know that I am only an ordinary person much like you... I am not the developer EA who created the games...

 I only made this torrent. Nothing more. If you have problems with the game, why not use Google and find some solutions. As soon as I read your problem, I used Google and immediatelly found that there are several people with the same problem as you in EA's Technical Support Page.
