Oh My Gawd!!! (also known as Oh My Gawd!!!...The Flaming Lips) is The Flaming Lips' second album, released on Restless Records in 1987. It is a slightly heavier album than their debut Hear It Is.

The first track opens with the quote, "Take this, brother. May it serve you well," from The Beatles' "Revolution 9"
The last track closes with a loop of the phrase "turn off your mind, relax..." sampled from The Beatles' "Tomorrow Never Knows"

Enjoy!
