Thought for the day:  Instead of selecting only the top students to 
admit into medical school, take the top 10% of applicants, and simply
enter them into a lottery and select at random.   This ensures that 
students well into the top 10% do not need to compete with each other. 
They can cooperate, volunteer in the community, develop their personalities 
in other ways, learn a broader range of subjects etc.   There is no evidence 
that selecting a student with 99% produces a better doctor than selecting a 
student with 90%.  But there is lots of evidence (and common sense) that says 
enforcing a dog-eat-dog competition, even among top students, selects 
pathologically competitive personalities which are not likely to be well 
rounded, emphathetic, or compassionate.   In short, they are not likely to 
make the best doctors.
