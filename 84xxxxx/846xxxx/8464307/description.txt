This is an fan album and may not be sold. 
This album is the results of three years of my life spent on search for Tenacious D songs and stuff... Y'know, I just compiled everything and this was made. 
So, if you are a Tenacious D fan, you NEED this album! 
Also, i'm sorry if any song is in a not-so-good quality, but is pretty hard to find some songs... (Actually, a lot)
You can also get it in my bandcamp:

And, again, this is a fan album, it is NOT FOR SALE! I'm sharing it with you for free, so don't try to make any money with it!
