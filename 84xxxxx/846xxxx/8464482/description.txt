My entire collection of ParaPara (eurobeat) musicvideos. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ParaPara :

Para Para (πâæπâ⌐πâæπâ⌐?, "Para-Para" or "ParaPara") is a synchronized group dance that originated in Japan. Unlike most club dancing and rave dancing there are specific synchronized movements for each song much like line dancing. Para Para is said to have existed since the early 1980s when European countries started selling Italo disco and Euro disco, and in the mid- to late 1970s New Wave and synthpop music in Japan, but did not achieve much popularity outside of Japan until the late '90s.

Para Para is strongly associated with Eurobeat. Dave Rodgers, a highly-recognized Eurobeat producer, has described Para Para as the only way to dance to Eurobeat, which is usually "so fast".

Seeded from gigabit for a while.

If you wonder, .m2v is MPEG2.
Rename them to .mpg or associate .m2v with your player of choice.
