[b][color=red]The UK version of the magazine,
 published by Haymarket Consumer Publications Ltd, 
is focused mainly on consumer electronics, 
gadgetry and lifestyle products, such as 
iPods and fast cars, to computers and men's 
clothing. Like its U.S. equivalent, Stuff UK 
contains a scantily clad woman on the front 
page (with a small number of further photos
 inside the magazine), but as the model 
is clothed this is not considered pornography 
in Britain.[/color][/b]
