Real Drive (2008)
Created by Production I.G and Masamune Shirow

Set in A.D. 2061, a new, more secure information network called the Material
Network (or "Metal") has taken over human society. However, aberrations begin
to crop up as individuals chafe against the rigid system, and so-called "cyber
divers" are dispatched to investigate these incidents.
