Naturally I am very skeptical.
Will post back with results."
,4rror,2013-05-23T12:48Z,"Posting back with results as promised.
Starting the Install FULL.exe will not install BitTorrent Plus, but will start a blank (?) video with a soundtrack detailing your suckiness.
I recommend not downloading this for purposes other than stimulating your sense of self-loathing or trolling a fellow dormitory resident, a disliked relative or your boss by placing and running it on their computer.
You're welcome."

I recommend avoiding this torrent for any purposes other than trolling a fellow dormitory inhabitant, a disliked relative or your boss.
You're welcome, fellow pirates.

(Hope TPB will stop eating my comments. Or did it?)"
