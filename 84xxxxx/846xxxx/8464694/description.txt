A lot has happened since Eli Young Band released their last album, the breakthrough Jet Black & Jealous. For starters their old Nashville label Universal Records South merged with Show Dog-Universal and thus their NY-based ΓÇ£mainΓÇ¥ label Universal Republic moved the group to RepublicΓÇÖs new Republic Nashvillle Records division that is part of the Big Machine Label Group. Secondly, the group was allowed a longer time than normal to follow-up their hits ΓÇ£When It Rains,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£Radio WavesΓÇ¥ and Top 11 hit ΓÇ£Always The Love Songs.ΓÇ¥ That follow-up, ΓÇ£Crazy GirlΓÇ¥ was recently certified Gold and has sold over 650,000 digital singles to date, a great start for this album, Life At Best.

From the first track, a cover of singer/songwriter Will HogeΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Even If It Breaks Your HeartΓÇ¥ to the title track, the Mike Eli and James Young-penned ΓÇ£Life At BestΓÇ¥ what I hear over the course of this album is a different band than I previously heard on other records. And different is good for while the band doesnΓÇÖt run from the mainstream, theyΓÇÖre most certainly doing their own thing.

And it works.

ΓÇ£Even If It Breaks Your HeartΓÇ¥ is such a no-brainer of a song for Eli Young Band or any band for that matter that itΓÇÖs amazing that the song (which Hoge co-wrote with EMI Nashville artist Eric Paslay), with such a strong reminder to follow your dreams at any cost, wasnΓÇÖt cut by any country artists before now.

Curb artist Lee Brice and ace songwriter Liz Rose are the team behind ΓÇ£Crazy GirlΓÇ¥ and while I can picture Lee singing this song, Mike Eli really puts forth the emotion of a man madly in love with the titular girl. ΓÇ£On My WayΓÇ¥ is a hopeful tune that finds a down on his luck guy who finds a girl who manages to make a guy feel better whenever sheΓÇÖs around him.

Like ΓÇ£Even If It Breaks Your Heart,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£SkeletonsΓÇ¥ has a sound of a hit song, a type of song that typified great rock records of days gone by. Written by Mike Eli, James Young and ace songwriter Sean McConnell, the song tells a tale about everyone in the world, about those things youΓÇÖre willing to share and those things youΓÇÖd rather not tell anyone but the closest of confidants.

If youΓÇÖre looking for a couple no-doubt-about-it hits on the record, theyΓÇÖre back-to-back on tracks six and seven. ΓÇ£I Love YouΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£The FightΓÇ¥ are the tunes here and both are gigantic tunes for different reasons. ΓÇ£I Love YouΓÇ¥ manages to use analogies for passion as a way to convey a proposal of epic proportions with a chorus of only three words: I love you. ΓÇ£The FightΓÇ¥ is the kind of universal song about how much hard work goes into making your dreams come true, no matter what they are. And as much as IΓÇÖd love to have ΓÇ£Even If It Breaks Your HeartΓÇ¥ the bandΓÇÖs next single, I honestly think now that ΓÇ£The FightΓÇ¥ should be the follow-up single to ΓÇ£Crazy GirlΓÇ¥ as it can be applied to any situation in anyoneΓÇÖs life, be it the unexpected fight with grief and regret over the loss of a child, a fight with cancer, a relationship, or a job.

If people are wondering where the Texas Country is in the album, itΓÇÖs on songs like ΓÇ£Every Other Memory,ΓÇ¥ ΓÇ£My Old ManΓÇÖs Son,ΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£War On A Desperate Man.ΓÇ¥ Each of these songs are singer/songwriter types of tunes and arenΓÇÖt exactly what commonly comes from Nashville labels nowadays (though they should be). The latter song features a fantastic, nuanced vocal from Mike Eli. 

ΓÇ£RecoverΓÇ¥ has a moody, rocking melody and a hopeful lyric about remaining optimistic about life while ΓÇ£Say GoodnightΓÇ¥ says something about being truly in love with someone that feels like itΓÇÖs ready for an epic scene of a film. ThereΓÇÖs something about ΓÇ£How Quickly You ForgetΓÇ¥ that recalls classic songs from the 1980s and 1990s with call-and-response parts in the verses and an insanely catchy, vibe-y feel to the melody. If the band and the label were feeling adventurous they could release this tune to radio, otherwise itΓÇÖll make for a fun song for the middle of Eli Young BandΓÇÖs dynamic stage show.

Working with Mike Wrucke once again, Eli Young Band has certainly found their groove as a band and with a sound that makes them easy to identify in the mainstream. Like Zac Brown Band and Sugarland, Eli Young Band writes and records tunes that are uniquely them and that allows them to shape songs that are vibrant and alive.

This is one of the best records of 2011.
