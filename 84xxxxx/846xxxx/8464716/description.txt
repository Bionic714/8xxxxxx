Completely reconfigurable UI with set-up wizard to suit to your specific workflow
Extensive routing, grouping, channel and metering control
Extensive analyser functionality, including 1/3 octave, 1/12 octave, spectrograph
Even in lowest CPU mode, generates super-high-quality prototypes - clear undistorted top-end
In FIR mode, Linear, Analogue, Minimum, Zero-Latency Analogue or even Free phase control
32 bands of EQ, Q 0.1-&gt;50, +/-36dB range
Each band can be Peak, HPF, LPF, High Shelf, Low Shelf or Notch
In stereo, each bank can process Mid, Side or the full stereo image
