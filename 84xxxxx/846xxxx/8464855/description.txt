After going unplugged for The Morning Passengers EP: Acoustic Sessions, Green River Ordinance went for a bigger, anthemic sound with 2012's Under Fire, recording in Texas and Oklahoma with producers Jordan Critz, Chad Copelin, and Jarod Evans, who magnify the group's alt-country sound with an ample amount of pop sheen and thick guitar crunch. Mixed with mellow acoustic moments, the result is a more dynamic album than Out of My Hands, but the long-running Matchbox 20 and Goo Goo Dolls comparisons are still merited. That said, the sleek, polished production paired with the urgent hooks and tight harmonies make for some singles that are perfectly geared toward adult alternative radio.
