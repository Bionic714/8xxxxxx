Nozoki Ana (English Translation = "A Peep Hole") is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by 
Honna Wakou about two college students, Tatsuhiko Kido and Ikuno Emiru, who are neighbors 
in the same apartment complex and are connected together by a small "peephole" between 
their rooms. Nozoki Ana was serialized in Shogakukan's Moba Man magazine and released 
in thirteen volume compilations between October 2009 and February 2013.

Nozoki Ana is about an art student named Tatsuhiko Kido. After moving to Tokyo into a 
new apartment to attend art school he notices a hole in the wall, at first he sees nothing 
through the hole but one day he sees a girl (Emiru) masturbating so he goes to her apartment to tell 
her that there is a hole between the wall. He meets Emiru and tries to chat but she walks 
back to her room and Kido follows. Kido trips and falls on top of her. Emiru suddenly takes a picture 
and says to Kido that she will erase the picture if he agrees to expose himself through the 
peep hole. 

This begins a life of "peeping" on each other. The story follows Kido through 
several relationships and his everyday life while he copes with being peeped on by and encouraged 
to peep on his neighbor; Ikuno Emiru.

*I did not scan the books. I ripped them from the mangastream website.

**I zipped the images and then converted them to a .cbz file. I then imported the file into comicrack and 
scraped it with the comicvine scraper. If you add the file to comicrack, all of the metadata 
should already be there for you.

***There are 13 volumes.
