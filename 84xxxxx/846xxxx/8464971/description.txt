Special Consensus has reached a highpoint in its 35 year career with the release of SCRATCH GRAVEL ROAD. Bandleader/banjoist Greg CahillΓÇÖs current line-up: Rick Faris (mandolin and vocals), David Thomas (bass and vocals) and newest member Dustin Benson (guitar and vocals) is one of the most exciting in bluegrass and, together with producer Alison Brown, they have recorded a 12 song set that is certain to be one of the most airplay friendly bluegrass releases of 2012. Stand-out tracks include ΓÇ£MonroeΓÇ¥ (featuring guest vocals from former members Josh Williams and Chris Jones), a first recording of the Harley Allen original ΓÇ£Good Problem to HaveΓÇ¥ and a dynamic reworking of the Golden Gate QuartetΓÇÖs classic gospel song ΓÇ£On My Way To The Kingdom Land.ΓÇ¥
