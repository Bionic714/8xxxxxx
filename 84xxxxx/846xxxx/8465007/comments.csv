,ChingaTuu,2013-05-13T06:26Z,"...AH, a Harry ""A"" Chesler character. Used to hear all sorts of stories about Chesler, and what the ""A"" really stood for. Most of which couldn't be repeated in mixed company, even if they were into that sort of thing. His Wiki entry is here:

...Kinda short, but the catamites running Wikipedia don't let those kinds of tales about characters like Chesler see print because it reminds them of what they do to each other both at work and after a drunken night at a local pick-up bar, usually working outside said bar :P"
