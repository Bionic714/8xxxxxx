This discography includes five of the six recordings from this group all ripped in mp3 format @320 (fuk flac) except Trip to Heaven which is ripped @ 192.  Sorry but I do not own this CD, that is why the bit rate is lower than the others.  I scanned all of the covers at multiple resolutions and all of the mp3 tags are updated and perfectly saved.  

NOTE: I am missing their 2004 release entitled The Bridge and would appreciate it if someone would upload it.
