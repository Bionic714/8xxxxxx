WeΓÇÖve combined the original Stars of Magic video, the first one
years ago). Amateur or professional, beginner or old-timer ΓÇô will
cherish, and watch over and over again.

The first one is about Harry LorayneΓÇÖs classics, and classics
they are. Nowhere else will you see Harry perform and teach his
AMAZING REVELATION DISPLAY ΓÇô it is a great piece of card
magic.

And hereΓÇÖs the only place youΓÇÖll see the performance of his
INVISIBLE PASS ROUTINE ΓÇô and he teaches you how to do it!
Do you want a non-sleight-of-hand card miracle? You have it
here in his AMAZING PREDICTION. And youΓÇÖll love his handling
of the $1 bill RIP-STORATION.

None of these are on any other video. But also included are
these other Lorayne classics: IMPROMPTU LINKING CARD
ROUTINE, SNAP! (rubber band little miracle), THE LORAYNE
SPREAD CONTROL, ULTRA MOVE, HaLo CUT.

On Magic Video #2 youΓÇÖll also see and learn effects and
routines that are not on any other video. TOGETHER AT LAST
is a beauty, and if you donΓÇÖt learn MONTE MONTE PLUS, youΓÇÖll
miss out on the best monte routine weΓÇÖve ever seen (which
does not use the too-well-known ΓÇ£hopΓÇ¥ move).

SILKNOT and IMPOSSIBLE 2-CARD LOCATION are each worth
the price of any video out there today.

Then thereΓÇÖs THE RIBBON-SPREAD PALM, KINGΓÇÖS HIGHWAY,
and SPREAD PASS DELAY. And if that isnΓÇÖt enough, Harry
demonstrates and teaches SALT-LESS, DOUBLE PANCAKE
REVELATION, HAN PING CHIEN FINESSE (and ΓÇ£finesseΓÇ¥ it is),
EASY INDICATOR and THE TOP-CARD COVER PASS.
These alone are more than you get on other magic videos ΓÇô
and nowhere else do you get Harry Lorayne!

YouΓÇÖll also see Harry perform CARD SHARP & FOUR
GAMBLERS for a lay audience. Watch closely to see how he
ΓÇ£setsΓÇ¥ with a shuffled deck. This is a performance only. Harry
teaches it on volume 3 of his "Best Ever" 4-volume DVD set.
You can check that out on this site.

Also included (performance and explanation): THE STING, THE
ORLAM SUBTLETY, THE STATUS QUO SHUFFLE, THE
CHARLIER SHUFFLE, NO GET-READY DOUBLE LIFT FROM
FOUR CARDS, THE UNIVERSAL REVERSAL, PARA-
PSYCHOLOGY, SECRET SUBTRACTION MOVE, RED/BLACK
SHUFFLE, A GREAT 4-ACE LOCATION, TO CATCH AN ACE
#5, THE FLIP-UP DOUBLE LIFT, THE HaLo CUT, SLIP CUT TO
TABLE, A DOUBLE-LIFT FINESSE.

You always get more than your moneyΓÇÖs worth with a Harry
Lorayne product. These two videos are perfect examples of
that!
