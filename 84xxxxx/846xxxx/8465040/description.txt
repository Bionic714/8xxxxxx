Infowars Magazine disseminates the belief that government and big business have colluded to create a New World Order through "manufactured economic crises, sophisticated surveillance tech andΓÇöabove allΓÇöinside-job terror attacks that fuel exploitable hysteria.

As a dedicated and aggressive Constutionalist, Jones consistently defends the Bill of Rights, property rights, and our nationΓÇÖs borders. In the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, Jones passionately argues against foreign entanglements and wars for the sake of corporate and banking interests. Jones avoids the bogus political labels of ΓÇ£left and rightΓÇ¥ and instead focuses on what really matters ΓÇö whatΓÇÖs right and wrong.
