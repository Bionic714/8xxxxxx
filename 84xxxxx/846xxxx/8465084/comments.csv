""My ego is so massive that I can't let Andy and Stewart be on anything that doesn't have MY NAME ON IT!!""

Why can't you just be happy having been in a BAND?? The Police were a UNIT, and would not have functioned without ALL THREE MEMBERS!!  Fu*k Sting.  He and Paul McCartney should go suck each off while they pretend they, and they alone are/were what MADE each of their bands.

Nice pic too. Douche. "
