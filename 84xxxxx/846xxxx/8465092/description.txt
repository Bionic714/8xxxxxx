Take a train out of London and head north past Leicester, past Leeds and beyond; cities and people turn into countryside and nothingness. Finally we reach Berwick-upon-Tweed, the last town in England. Carry on north and we have Scotland, to the east the cold expanse of the North Sea and to the south and west nothing but rolling countrysideΓÇª this is the sound of Eastern Lane.

On first impressions, Eastern Lane are a jangly guitar pop band, something youΓÇÖd find from a few years back. But there is something deeper there, lyrics conveying nothingness and isolation but at the same time the happiness and freedom of running through the fields and woods free from the constraints of the city, sometimes dark (ΓÇÿVena CavaΓÇÖ) and sometimes happy (ΓÇÿDead JulyΓÇÖ). A fine mixture of Mogwai style music and Ian CurtisΓÇÖs lyrics.

It gets a bit angular in places, sometimes a bit country and western like in ΓÇÿPortrait of TuesdayΓÇÖ whereas ΓÇÿLooking for RosesΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿHoly ArmsΓÇÖ are garage rock, like a live Strokes, pounding drums, jangly squeeling guitars, frantic yet thoughtful.

ΓÇÿHumardΓÇÖ is best listened to via headphones on a train rolling past the sea, haunting loud and quiet music it makes you think, and appreciate the world around you.

The final track ΓÇÿHear the DarkΓÇÖ, recorded in pitch black at 2 am, you can feel the emptiness run down your back. Close your eyes and youΓÇÖll find yourself in the middle of nowhere, the music echoing around you and through you.

ΓÇÿHave you finished with my words? I need to waste them again.ΓÇÖ A simply stunning album.
