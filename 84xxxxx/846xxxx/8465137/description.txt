 : The year is 1803, and Darcy and Elizabeth have been married for six years. :
 : There are now two handsome and healthy sons in the nursery, Elizabeth's    :
 : beloved sister Jane and her husband Bingley live nearby and the orderly    :
 : world of Pemberley seems unassailable. But all this is threatened when, on :
 : the eve of the annual autumn ball, the guests are preparing to retire for  :
 : the night when a chaise appears, rocking down the path from Pemberley's    :
 : wild woodland. As it pulls up, Lydia Wickham - Elizabeth's younger,        :
 : unreliable sister - stumbles out screaming that her husband has been       :
 : murdered. Inspired by a lifelong passion for the work of Jane Austen, PD   :
 : James masterfully recreates the world of Pride and Prejudice, and combines :
 : it with the excitement and suspense of a brilliantly-crafted crime story.  :
