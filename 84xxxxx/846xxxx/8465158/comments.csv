Running it on Win 8, VLC media player on stereo sound."
,BlueberryCarrot,2013-06-12T07:50Z,"Agree with DrTen, pretty average quality with audio distortion and blocky picture. I have played this on Windows 7 with VLC player as well as an external media player via Television.

Couldn't get it play on my Sony S tablet, which usually has no issues. Just gave me gurgly sound and jumping picture."
