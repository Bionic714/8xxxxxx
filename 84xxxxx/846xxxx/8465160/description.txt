Here's a collection of Philip K Dick novels and collected short stories in EPUB  format.  I know there are some big ones like "A Scanner Darkly" missing.  I have many others in .mobi and .azw3 format.  If people are after Philip K Dick books missing from this collection please let me know and I can convert to EPUB and make another torrent with the missing titles.
Also what do people on here prefer?  most of my collections are in EPUB and AZW3 but am not sure what most people want.
