Any chance of ul-ing other Mister X series that you haven't ul-ed yet?  ;-)

I'm such a Dean Motter fan."

The only other available release that I am aware of is the one called ""Mister X Vol 1"" right here ( http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7578939/Mister_X_Vol_1 ). It consists of the very first issues of the Vortex series, published in the mid-eighties, as referred to above.

The quality is nowhere near as good as that of these releases, of course - independent scans of ordinary and aged paper copies. There are various re-releases in omnibus formats, according to the Wikipedia article, so we can hope for a both more comprehensive and much nicer version at some point in the future, though. :)
