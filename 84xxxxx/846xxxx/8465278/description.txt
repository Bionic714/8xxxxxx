Here are nine modern translations of St. Augustine's Confessions.


All are pdf format except Chadwick, which is epub and mobi. The pdf files are all (except for Outler) new scans, and all are searchable.

Includes versions by the following translators (with date of original publication in parentheses):

F. J. Sheed (1943)
Albert Outler (1955)
John K. Ryan (1960)
R. S. Pine-Coffin (1961)
Rex Warner (1963)
Henry Chadwick (1992)
Maria Boulding (1997)
Philip Burton (2001)
Garry Wills (2006)

If you're wondering which one to read, I would suggest Maria Boulding, but most of these translations have admirers. However, I've seen the Pine-Coffin version, despite being the most popular (due to the fact that it's a Penguin), criticized for inaccuracy. Wills' version is surprising and radically different from any other version I've seen. Sheed seems to capture Augustine's rhetorical passion best. Chadwick has been very widely praised for its accuracy and helpful notes and 
introduction.
