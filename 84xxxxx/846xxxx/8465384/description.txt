Detective sergeant Danny Dartin was frustrated by criminals who had enough money and influence to escape justice, so he put on a costume, becoming the Raven. He then went after those elusive criminals, taking their cash and redistributing it to the poor like Robin Hood. His focus eventually expanded to all criminals who somehow evaded justice. He found an on-again, off-again love interest in Lola Lash, the daughter of NYC's police chief. At first, Lola was suspicious of his masked alter ego, but she eventually changed her views and started to aid him in secret (since her father wouldn't have been happy if he knew). He had no powers but was a talented fighter and detective. His enemies include the Lizard. Raven used a pistol and kept a pocket knife concealed inside one of his sleeves.
