Profile

After discovering the joys and frustrations of creating music on the iPad in 2012 (thanks ipadmusic subreddit) I have now been able to rekindle a flame from many years ago.


Notes on Tracks

All tracks were created using applications on my iPad 2 (jailbroken for internal file transfers). Some keyboard work was input using a Keyrig 49 USB keyboard (via the iPad camera connector). Vocals were recorded with a Blue Yeti Pro USB mike (via the iPad camera connector). Cover art is created with iPad app Procreate.
