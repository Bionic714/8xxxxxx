OST - Vangelis-Sex Power(1970)Remastered 2013

This LP has 11 tracks, six on side A and five on side B, none of 

which are titled or listed, either on the label or anywhere on the 

gatefold sleeve. Tracks 2 and 5 of side 1 were released as a 

single with the titles "Djemilla" and "Third Love".
I merged the first and second track.I recognized the melody of the 

song╦¥Third Love╦¥ in two places,in track 8 and 10,and named them    

Third Love 2,Third Love 3.
