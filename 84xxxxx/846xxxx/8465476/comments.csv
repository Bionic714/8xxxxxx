,KiwiPirate,2013-05-14T04:20Z,"i opened up the executable and these are the included languages

note that the spanish is different to the one listed in the description however i did just test it and they both seem to work fine

also if you enter a wrong code it seems to default to your system language
i don't think any of the ones i listed in the description that are not listed here work (i tried 418 and 40b and game stayed as english text)

409 = English (United States)
804 = Chinese (simplified)
405 = Czech
40c = French (France)
407 = German (Germany)
40e = Hungarian
410 = Italian (Italy)
412 = Korean
415 = Polish
419 = Russian
c0a = Spanish (International Sort)"
