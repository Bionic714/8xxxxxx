I got to playing around after a comment on my Shades of Darkness-Catalyst FIX torrent about it being in Russian (it isn't) but this is the other languages installed with the original game

Only four other spoken languages are included in the game and this is them
French / German / Polish / Spanish


Shades of Darkness IS NOT REQUIRED, only the original Heroes VI and it will work on any install

Once uploaded i will be deleting my copy so please don't just leech ...


Instructions:

Extract your desired language (HeroesVI **.rar) directly into the folder your game files are installed to

Open the registry editor (regedit.exe)

go to key:

** x86 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREUbisoftMight & Magic Heroes VI
** x64 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeUbisoftMight & Magic Heroes VI

double click on the entry named 'Language' and change to your desired language using the 3 digits on the left

this will give you the language as TEXT ONLY in game (if you don't select one of the four languages archived in this torrent)

I CAN NOT, DO NOT AND WILL NOT GUARANTEE THEY ALL WORK
