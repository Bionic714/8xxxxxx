,Nomadif,2013-05-12T21:57Z,"no this is the 13th episode. Also, this episode has a dumb watermark on it. not worth downloading. The mark is in big bold white letters at the bottom of the video. really annoying when uploaders do this."
,TabascoQuesadilla,2013-05-12T22:06Z,"It's 13 if you count ""The Snowmen"" as episode 6."
,duceowen,2013-05-12T23:44Z,Snowmen was the Christmas Special which isn't included in the count.
,TabascoQuesadilla,2013-05-13T00:57Z,"THAT'S FUCKING STUPID.

I'm sorry, I know you're technically right, but I think it's fucking stupid to expect casual viewers to know when to watch everything if there's a whole episode between 5 and 6 they have to worry about."
,Andy_S,2013-05-13T04:06Z,"no worth downloading as ""hannibal"" (whoever he is) messed this ""release"" by that watermark crap AGAIN! This has NOTHING to do in scene releases! "

I agree that the BBC has some odd ways of labeling episodes - but the important thing is, that season X episode conventions are more important than just showing an order. 

Going to any TV database on the internet, even tv.com, will have the episodes labeled the same - putting Nightmare in Silver as s07e12."

But the Xmas 2012 special ""The Snowmen"" was twice the length of a regular episode and aired roughly 8 weeks after 7x05 Angels Take Manhattan and roughly 13 weeks before 7x06 Bells of St John (which is how everywhere but IMDB refer to them). Even the casual viewer should be able to tell a Christmas special from a regular episode."
