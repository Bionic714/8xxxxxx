Description:
In the fast-moving world of computers, things are always
changing. Since the first edition of this strong-selling book
appeared two years ago, network security techniques and
tools have evolved rapidly to meet new and more
sophisticated threats that pop up with alarming regularity.
The second edition offers both new and thoroughly updated
hacks for Linux, Windows, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X servers
that not only enable readers to secure TCP/IP-based
services, but helps them implement a good deal of clever
host-based security techniques as well.

This second edition of Network Security Hacks offers 125
concise and practical hacks, including more information for
Windows administrators, hacks for wireless networking (such
as setting up a captive portal and securing against rogue
hotspots), and techniques to ensure privacy and anonymity,
including ways to evade network traffic analysis, encrypt
email and files, and protect against phishing attacks. System
administrators looking for reliable answers will also find
concise examples of applied encryption, intrusion detection,
logging, trending and incident response.
