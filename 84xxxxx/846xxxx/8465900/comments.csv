,the_dude74,2013-05-13T06:38Z,"To be honest I don't even know how to make a cbr. I thought about it, but I just didn't really have time to figure it out and I wanted to just these up for people. I also was thinking about making a complete set as a cbr once I figure out how. I'm really not that big of a tech guy or anything, I just searched for a how to on making torrents so I could post these cavewoman's for everybody. I'm glad you could get em, it took me forever to find em all, and I actually didn't even have all these when I started posting the first ones.

As for Rain #4, as soon as I can get one I'll put it up, but no telling when that might be. Same goes for Beauties and Beasts #2."
,MrSept,2013-05-14T05:04Z,"Hey thats cool, like I said I was just curious, and as far as making them cbr's its as easy as using Winrar, collecting all of the files under a zip or rar file and then just changing the extension to cbr, I was surprised how easy it was too, but I did it successfully with all your torrents "
,the_dude74,2013-05-14T07:31Z,"Cool, I think that'll definitely be the next thing I figure out and start doing then."
,ElDopo,2013-05-17T23:29Z,Thank you for all the excellent and hard-to-find Cavewoman fills- Wondering if you have a source for either Cavewoman - Jungle Tales of ... (1998) or  Cavewoman - Reloaded (2005)? I've been looking for those for awhile...
,the_dude74,2013-05-20T23:30Z,"You bet man, glad I could share. I believe I have all of the Jungle Tales copies so if there's something I missed that you want to grab then give me the details and I'll see if I can't get it on here for you."
