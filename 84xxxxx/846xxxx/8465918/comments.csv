once again 1000 thanks for re-seeding of Muse and Mike O'Connell videos. Be sure I'll serve these nice videos for a couple of time and re-seed them systematic for the other leechers.

The only video from this list not finished is:
* Muse - Bliss (Live Reading 2006).avi

Some other of your 'old babies' incomplete are:
* Frida - Baby Don't You Cry No More (Live Show-Express 1982).avi
* Frida - Come To Me (Live Na Sowas 1984).avi
* Frida - I Know There's Something Going On (Live Show-Express 1982).avi
* Frida - To Turn The Stone (Live Show-Express 1983).avi

Most of them only a few bytes are missing. Thanks in the name of a number of TPB members and long time ROSAmannen fans!
