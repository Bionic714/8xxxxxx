,Kona_Guy,2013-05-13T07:05Z,"Ok, thanks for the upload!"
,Xeire,2013-05-14T08:24Z,Ill try this one hope fully this one will work
,Aaron_Alpha19,2013-05-16T13:01Z,Does this include all of the items from the release to May? 
,huldu,2013-05-18T01:01Z,"Does this have the *updated* ""Stones Throw Greenhouse"". It was bugged in earlier version and had to be re-downloaded for the new updated version. The bug is that you can't actually use the greenhouse roof as ""roof"" unless it's updated..."
,huldu,2013-05-18T01:22Z,"Does this have the *updated* version of ""Stones Throw Greenhouse""? There was a bug in the first release that was fixed after a few weeks of the release. Ie you couldn't actually use the greenhouse roof as an actual roof. 

The updated version allows you to use normal flat roof and if you place the greenhouse roof on top it'll make the floor ""invisible"", hence a greenhouse. Previously if you used the greenhouse roof it wouldn't count as a roof and snow/rain would go through. "
,McCoco,2013-05-25T19:10Z,"I have a few questions, what happens when we download June? Will it install ALL of the other months like in this may torrent? And what happens if we installed all the content from 09 to 13? These fixes say for v1.3.2, and at the moment I think the game is v1.50 I believe.. so how does that effect the game, will I even be able to use any of these? If someone could answer these, that would be fantastic"
,McCoco,2013-05-25T19:11Z,"Also if June is up to date with the version, does that mean we would have to re-install all the content that was previously made v1.3.2?"
,odinrwar,2013-05-30T22:55Z,Are you going to get the dragon valley or renaissance packs?
,nymphn91,2013-06-02T13:51Z,I'll find there The Duke of Bows Renaissance Faire? 
,zaronon,2013-06-02T21:05Z,"McCoco:

When you get the June version, you only install what you haven't already installed. So you install the decrapified sims3pack Dragon Valley and either the June 2013 decrapified sims3pack, the June 2013 .package or replace ""Sims 3 Store Updates 041-048"" with ""Sims 3 Store Updates 041-049"" depending on which way you installed the may version."
,Falcon2Dragon,2013-06-06T13:53Z,"Much thanks goes out to you for all your work. I was wondering how to locate just the 'retired' items in your files rather than take each torrent. I do understand how to search the new content on a monthly basis, just curious to know if there is a reverse. Thanks in advance for your time and patience from this newbie"
,Netealia85,2013-06-07T14:45Z,"This is great, just a small question though does anyone else have a few items that show up as empty slots with only prices that you can't select?"
,zaronon,2013-06-08T17:55Z,Netealia85 have you turned shopmode off? It's somewhere in the options menu (don't have access to the game right now)
