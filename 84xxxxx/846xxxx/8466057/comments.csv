Stuck at 65%, so it's time to QUIT. Like this show but..."

,beechyboy,2013-05-14T14:44Z,"I finally got to down this show. (I like Bondi Vet but don't like Bondi Rescue)
The quality was really good. It should be labeled HQwebrip.
Keep it up dude!

[V],psspss,2013-05-17T12:05Z,"i had a look and I dont think it aired this week Ep8
its not listed in wiki and no full episode hosted at tru
not that anyone can get unless got a usa cable
tvrage if listed might of been wrong
but its not listed there either was it a holiday in usa or something happened at the store so it didnt air?
http://www.tvrage.com/Hardcore_Pawn/episode_list

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hardcore_Pawn_episodes"

[T],trialNerror,2013-05-19T12:14Z,"No, you did not say anything of the such.
Using words like ""I think"", ""maybe"", and ""might"" are words of an uncertain person.
You were very unsure if it aired or not.
I confirmed for you and others that it definitely did not air.

You're welcome."
[V],psspss,2013-05-19T13:48Z,"stop being a NOB tne.. never ends with you..

great for you to confirm but all you had to say is
I can confirm PSSPSS is right that episode didnt air
