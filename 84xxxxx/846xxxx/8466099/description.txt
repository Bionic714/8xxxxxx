In these 3 movies semi-pros, some of them became pros nowadays, doing some crazy shit on lan and online events. The game is the fucking best fps ever - cs 1.6. 
Following fragmovie video is legendary. You cannot find any other of this kind. I saw a lot of fragmovies of past decade (about Spawn, Fnatic and SK team members, Arbalet cups, Na'Vi's winout, Asus cups, etc) and I'm confident enough to state this. 

Fukken enjoy it and don't forget to seed. I had hard times to acquire this shit through internets.
