DESCRIPTION:

Icon Themer allows you to use Nova/Apex/ADW/Go etc. icon packs on your device.




You can now use any launcher you prefer and still have the power to customize how your application icons look like.

(Note: If your launcher is replacing the icons with their own theme, Icon Themer would appear to be not working)

Icon Themer is also more consistent because the icon theme is applied throughout your device and not just confined your launcher!
See the screenshots to believe!
