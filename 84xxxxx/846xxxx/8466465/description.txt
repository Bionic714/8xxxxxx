The original Harry Manfredini scores to Friday the 13th Parts 1 through 6 were finally released last year. They even included the recycled/re-edited cues from the first two films that were created for Parts 3 and 4. I was really excited to get these, as they are fantastic, but at the same time I was disappointed that the same wasnΓÇÖt done for Part VII- one of my favorites from the series. Part VIIΓÇÖs score is unique; Harry Manfredini wasnΓÇÖt available, so they used his music from the previous films in addition to new music from Fred Mollin (who was scoring Friday the 13th: The Series at the time). Sometimes even mixing the two on top of each other. IΓÇÖm guessing the boxset didnΓÇÖt include Part 7 due to legal reasons because of the inclusion of MollinΓÇÖs music. Or maybe it was just because no brand new Manfredini music was created for the film. But the newly edited and mixed tracks created a brand new listening experience...

So, armed with the boxed set from the first six movies, and the stand-alone Mollin score for Part VII, I set out to recreate the soundtrack for The New Blood. I like MollinΓÇÖs new music, as the main theme for Tina captures the new supernatural element quite well, but listening to the Mollin CD on its own looses the Friday feel without ManfrediniΓÇÖs signature sound, which is still very prominent in the film. Recreating the film mix ultimately proved to be much more challenging than I had anticipated though. Mostly because they did a great job on creating this score, as itΓÇÖs a pretty complicated mix. I had originally heard it was music from Part 6, but after delving into it, I realized that while a good chunk of the used Manfrdini music did indeed come from Part 6, portions from the other films were used as well. So identifying the Manfredini tracks became a very big challenge. (Thanks to JackSparrow900 for helping to identify some of the Manfredini cues.) The score is often a mix of different sections of Mandredini edits, sometimes mixed together, and sometimes also mixed with the Mollin tracks. In addition, a lot of the ΓÇ£ci-ci-ciΓÇ¥ sounds must have also been created for the movie, so you have these sounds mixed with multiple Manfredini tracks and Mollin tracks sometimes all at the same time.

I did my best to recreate the score from the Manfredini box set, the Mollin soundtrack, and extractions from the DVD. Alas, some tracks have sound effects because the extractions were all that are available. And I tried layering in most of the ΓÇ£ci-ci-ciΓÇ¥ sounds using the extractions. Unfortunately, the Mollin CD isnΓÇÖt even complete, as it doesnΓÇÖt contain any of his music from the scene where Tina finds the bodies until the end of the film. So those tracks are extractions with some sound effects. Also, challenging was the fact that the Mollin tracks were mostly strung together on the CD.

One scene in the film (Michael and his girlfriend walking through the woods) has a Manfredini track that in not on any of the other soundtracks (titled ΓÇ£New BloodΓÇ¥ here). A small portion IS heard in Part 6 when Tommy has (audio) memories of killing Jason as a child, but it is mixed over the other track, and the soundtrack doesnΓÇÖt even have it mixed as heard in the film. A few smaller Manfredini stingers couldnΓÇÖt be found either, so appear here as extractions.

The Mollin track ΓÇ£Pearls Go FlyingΓÇ¥ is NOT heard in the film, but was probably meant for the scene where Tina breaks MelissaΓÇÖs pearls, so I included in where it would have been.

I have also created art for the cover and back with a tracklisting. In the end, IΓÇÖm pretty happy with how it turned out, and it might be as close to a soundtrack to Part VII as we get.
