My mistake, sorry"

,thepenguinator,2013-05-12T15:14Z,"Much appreciated, Devastat0r36  :)"
,dahaka47,2013-05-12T15:59Z,"Heh, I'll make you a golden statue if you manage to get this working on NVIDIA graphics cards. Newer, older - no go. Doesnt even depend on operating system - same crap under Windows XP and Windows 7. I own the game, and this crap doesn't work.

If someone does find a working fix for the game or working NVIDIA drivers - please post."
,thepenguinator,2013-05-12T20:05Z,"I had it working on a win98 pc, admittedly, it's an old box that I have laying around.

Must admit though i didn't work on win98 and winxp on vmware. Most likely due to the fact that vmware emulates a graphic adapter fit for directx 9 (which isn't compatible with directx "
,thepenguinator,2013-05-12T20:07Z,"hmm someone stole the last part of sentence... o.O

...which isn't fully compatible with directx 6 or lower.

Well, anyway, it's provided 'as is', maybe someone will have a use for it :)

,dahaka47,2013-05-13T03:54Z,"Well, one day... NVIDIA will fix the bugs, and the game will work again. It took them years to fix ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"". Racer wasn't working at all, and on newest drivers it does work - but with black ""shadows"" covering the screen almost completely. Eventually I guess they'll fix that. Sometime in 2020, I predict. :P"
,dahaka47,2013-05-13T03:56Z,"Oh, forgot to add: if you have 64-bit OS, don;t even bother downloading. The game uses 16-bit installer, which is absolutely incompatible with 64-bit OS. You won't even be able to install it.

...unless you're willing to play around in virtual machine."
,Cerebral222,2013-05-13T06:04Z,"Thanks for the upload, but I tried this on 2 desktops & 1 laptop, it sort of worked on my laptop, but was not playable, as for the 2 desktops, 1 using nVidia, the other using an ATI graphics card, they both had the same whiteout issues, nevertheless, this torrent inspired me to do an emulated version, I would doubt it would work on 64 bit, I have tested it on Win7 32 bit, works like a charm.
