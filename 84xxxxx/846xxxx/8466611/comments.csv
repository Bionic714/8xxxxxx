,Weston0175,2013-05-13T17:03Z,Can you seed your holly starr torrent?
,freakforyeshua2,2013-05-13T17:28Z,Thank you so much again for sharing this awesome music with us. I was wondering if you will be sharing the new John Elefante release soon in a bundle? Grace and Peace be with you.
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-13T23:23Z,"freakforyeshua2, yeah I have a copy of that John Elefante album.  It will be released in my 17th bundle.  So far I have about 700mb of the 2gb I will be using, just to give you a better idea of ""when"" it will be torrented."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-13T23:27Z,"Weston0175 my brother, I absolutely dread going back and pumping new life into my old torrents.  It completely undermines the basic concept of a torrent when the Seeder has to return to rejuvenate one.

And there in lays my problem with sharing discographies.  24 hours later, and it's not uncommon for all the Seeders to abandon the torrent.  Now that may be fine with most torrents, but this is a Ministry here.  This is God's Message we're dealing with."
,Tiga1234,2013-05-14T16:41Z,I am just asking if you found the DJ Cookie song i requested. 
,phil215,2013-05-14T19:49Z,Thanks for another great torrent! I was wondering if you could include Falling Up's Machine De Ella Project in the next one?
,Weston0175,2013-05-14T21:30Z,"The Torrent stopped at 14.5 %, so there's some progress from when I first tried to download it. This morning it was at 0 %. So, there's most likely at least one sporadic seeder doing the Holly Starr torrent. "
,Weston0175,2013-05-14T21:31Z,I would like to be a seeder for some of your torrents. Any idea as to HOW I do that?
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-14T22:00Z,"Tiga1234, yeah I have that DJ Cookie single for ya. I'm currently sitting at about 1.1GB of the 2GB I need to create another torrent.  So it will indeed be included in my next bundle for ya."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-14T22:01Z,"Phil215, I heard of that Machine De Ella Project but I've yet to come across a copy.  Time permitting, I'll search for it later on this evening and if I come across it, it'll be bundled in my next torrent for ya."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-14T22:03Z,"Weston0175, I'll jump on that Holly Starr for you to give ya a boost.  No offense with my rant.  It just disappoints me when a torrent can't stay alive for 24 hours.  It's like preaching the Word of God and nobody showing up to listen.  But I guess it gets back to the parable of the seed, right?  Either way, I'll boost Holly Starr for ya shortly."
,phish2525,2013-05-15T14:19Z,"Can you put the new Shane & Shane ""Everything Is Different"" into a new torrent...bundle 13 keeps giving me errors in downloading files.  THANK YOU!  God bless!"
,phish2525,2013-05-15T14:20Z,"Also, do you have The Digital Age EP (former members of the David Crowder*Band)?"
