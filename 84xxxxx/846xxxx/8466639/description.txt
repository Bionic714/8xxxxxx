 Mark Banks distinctly remembers the crazed sensation that came over him, when at the tender age of ten, Kurt CobainΓÇÖs Teen Spirit began blaring from his boom box speakers and he knew what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. Like many singer-songwriters before him, the road was a rocky one. At eighteen he was accepted to Cal Arts in Valencia, CA where he studied Music Theory and began classical training in both voice and guitar. Youthful rebellion got the best of him though, dropping out after only one semester to reform his teenage rock band HWY ONE. Living out of their car while touring the great state of California, the highlight of the bands short career was a show at The Whiskey A GO GO in Hollywood. After a brief stint of excessive drug use and generally bad choices, Mark decided to choose a new path.
