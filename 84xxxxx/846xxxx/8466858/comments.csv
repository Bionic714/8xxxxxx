,adupre,2013-05-12T18:28Z,"yeah... could we please have the SKY coverage???!! its less a question of whose coverage is better, and more a concern over consistency... if i watch 75% of the grands prix covered by SKY, and 25% covered by BBC, its inconsistent... i'd rather watch coverage from a single source throughout the season... and since SKY holds the rights to the majority of the races, SKY it has to be... right???"
,totocon,2013-05-12T18:40Z,"Very fast torrent! THX!

,Cock_Pushup,2013-05-16T05:50Z,"Hey footy,
I don't know if you read these messages, but I wanted to say thanks nonetheless! I'm a Yank with no television, so your torrents are the only way I have of seeing these races for the past 2 or 3 seasons. And as an added bonus, your video/audio quality are topnotch. You are a godsend. 
Pardon my crude nickname, just a silly attempt to remain anonymous."
