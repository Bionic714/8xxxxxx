,enonumus,2013-05-13T16:16Z,"A8.5/V9  Excellent copy, but the audio in the 1.8GB ""Unknown"" version that was uploaded this morning (5/13) seems flawless from spot checking, whereas there are still some occasional low popping noises in this version that aren't present in the same scenes in the ""Unknown"" copy.  This is 100% watchable however."

,lkettles,2013-05-14T00:35Z,"Decent, but download the UnknoWn copy for perfection"
,IAMH67,2013-05-14T00:43Z,"Good enough video, decent audio.

Video has no problem apart from syncing with the audio for very short periods of 5 seconds but this only happened  or 4 times.

Audio though seems to be from a TS or CAM but has been cleaned and is clearly understandable. Sometimes the audio is replaced with the sound of static 3-4 times in the movie but only for a short time and not at any important point. Also the sound has cracking noise throughout the movie but it isn't that annoying, kind of like the audio is playing on those old age rotating discs.

,DrMD,2013-05-14T17:02Z,"Definitely watchable with some static type sound in the background which is only slightly noticeable and doesn't take away much but the movie itself is pretty fucking lame, feel sorry for anyone laying out serious coin for this in the theater.A really horrible movie.V=9 A=7 M=4 generous for the effects."

Sadly, since Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce, and Don Cheadle are GOOD actors, there parts make them look stupid to give stooges like Downey and Paltrow a chance to look okay in comparison. That's the same reason they make Jude Law act liek a buffoon in the Sherlock Holmes films. "

,repsolfireblade05,2013-05-15T04:16Z,"@will951  download vlc player ,just google it mate .once you have finished downloading the file ,doube click and it will come up in whatever folder you selected when you setup your torrent downloader,example videos or downloads ,look for the biggest file ex:13254kb opposed to 5kb ,then double click and it should play with your vlc or windows media player but vlc player is better ,,hope that helps ,,"
,repsolfireblade05,2013-05-15T04:33Z,"ps will951 ,,im not sure if you have a torrent downloader ,if not download utorrent or torch torrent is very easy to use just google it and download it ,then once youve done that go to the file on tpb that you want to download and click get this torrent ,,only download from people with a skull next to their name ,such as BONE ,or you may end up with viruses ,,always read comments from other fellow pirates ,good luck ,,"
,ScottyD7421,2013-05-15T04:44Z,"@will951, the following is just in-case you are unaware of how TPB works;

First u need a download engine, i use Frostwire which can be downloaded for free at www.frostwire.com

Next to download a movie click on ""Get This Torrent""which will open up FrostWire, a box will open up showing you the contents of the file allowing u to select what u want to download. I normally only download the video file and un-check the other boxes (unless i require subs).    

@repsolfireblade05 is spot on with VLC player, i have found it by far the best. 

My advice, try to download only from people with skulls as they are less likely to have bodgy files. Also, make sure you read comments from other downloaders but beware of spammers leaving negative comments to put us off downloading.

Hope this is useful :-) "

,mbb99,2013-05-15T07:03Z,"This may not be Blu-ray or even quite DVD quality it's pretty damn good. The audio has a little click throughout the movie and in a few short instants you here a crackle it goes away. It's never in NEED to hear parts or anything. I think the video is VERY watchable and I watched on my 46"" LCD. There are very few times the subtitles pop up and are by no means a distraction. People bitch too much to watch a great film that just came out for free. Kudos BONE and thanks so much. Long time fan!
