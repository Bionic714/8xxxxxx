Iron Man 3 2013 R6 LiNE READNFO XViD - JUSTiCE



SOURCE : VIDEO - R6
        AUDIO - UNiQUE


Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....


Ok same video as our v2 cam release ....however this time i have syncd the line audio off
unique's release to our video.
They used the other video that was nice and had no watermarks ...but have HC subs.So thought doing
this,this way gives you another option.
Also have cleaned the audio up in adobe,changing the eq bands aswell as using a light hiss filter.
Will say there is parts where theres some static that comes and goes and whilst i've toned it down
it was impossible to remove without wrecking the audio so ....
