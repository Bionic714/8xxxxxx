In Sloaneâ™s world, true feelings are forbidden, teen suicide is an epidemic, and the only solution is The Program.

Sloane knows better than to cry in front of anyone. With suicide now an international epidemic, one outburst could land her in The Program, the only proven course of treatment. Sloaneâ™s parents have already lost one child; Sloane knows theyâ™ll do anything to keep her alive. She also knows that everyone whoâ™s been through The Program returns as a blank slate. Because their depression is gone—but so are their memories.

Under constant surveillance at home and at school, Sloane puts on a brave face and keeps her feelings buried as deep as she can. The only person Sloane can be herself with is James. Heâ™s promised to keep them both safe and out of treatment, and Sloane knows their love is strong enough to withstand anything. But despite the promises they made to each other, itâ™s getting harder to hide the truth. They are both growing weaker. Depression is setting in. And The Program is coming for them.
