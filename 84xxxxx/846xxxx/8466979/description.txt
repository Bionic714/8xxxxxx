Thought for the day:  Electoral Reform. In a first-past-the-post electoral 
system (currently used in only USA, UK, and Canada), the candidate in any 
local riding with the most votes wins.  This works OK when there are only 
2 candidates, but with 3 or more, it often leads to vote splitting, allowing 
a relatively unpopular candidate (or party) to still win.  It also leads to 
highly divisive politics. 

Using a form of modified proportional representation, such as 
Germany does, where any party getting 5% or more of the popular vote
also gets that percentage of the seats in the legislature allows 
parties with distributed geographic support to still have some clout. This 
encourages the creation of new and responsive parties to appeal to smaller
political constituencies.

Another good alternative is preference balloting, where voters record their 
first, second, and third choice (etc).  If any candidate has more than 50%
support counting only first choices, then she wins.  If nobody does, then 
look at the first and second choices.  If still nobody has more than 50%, then
look at first, second, and third choices, etc.  Continue until a candidate is 
found who has the support of more than 50% of voters.  Preference ballotting
tends to select the candidate that is the least offensive to the most number
of people, and thus encourages inclusive concensus-building politicians.
