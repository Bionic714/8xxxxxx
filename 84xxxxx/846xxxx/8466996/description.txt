Thought for the day:  Socialized Medicine.  Some Americans object to socialized 
medicine, which every other country in the world embraces.  The odd thing is that
most objectors tend to have health insurance, and this is the definition of socialized 
medicine, since it spreads the insured persons costs across a larger group.  
The conclusion is that Americans against socialised medicine actually object to the 
group they are lumped in with, not to lumping in itself.  It is also possible they 
object to perceived inefficiencies in socialized schemes, but if so, they  have it 
backwards.  In a case where insurance companies can pick and choose who they 
insure, they have to avoid bad risks, and cherry pick the "healthy" applicants.  The
time and expense of determining who is healthy is paid by every insurer who considers 
the applicant, even though the applicant ultimately gets the insurance from only 
one provider.  This duplication of effort is a fundamental inefficiency of allowing
cherry picking.  Most socilized heath care schemes avoid this problem by having a single
payer, instead of multiple insurance companies.   However, even if America wanted to preserve
its current health insurance industry structure, with multiple firms there is a way.   
Those insurance companies don't actually care what the cost of 
providing health care is, they make their money by averaging it all out and adding a 
profit margin, then charging the corresponding premiums to their customer base.  What 
insurance companies cannot tolerate is being stuck with more unhealthy clients than 
other competing firms.   A solution is to prohibit any insurance company from cherry 
picking.  This could be done by having a 3rd party assign clients to insurance 
companies randomly, or by ensuring insurance companies enroll new clients without 
being permitted to see their health history.   It might sound strange, but that actually
achieves the result you want, which is that companies are rewarded for delivering 
services cost effectively to their clients, instead of being rewarded for avoiding 
clients needing health services in the first place.
