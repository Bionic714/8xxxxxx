Thought for the day:  Secrecy Does not Work
Knowledge is power. But keeping knowledge private is increasingly tough. 
Bradley Manning leaked hundreds of thousands of State Department cables
to Wikileaks, and they all fit easily on a USB memory stick. At no time in 
history has the individual had so much power when confronting corrupt 
institutions.

It is effectively impossible for any organization to prevent its private 
information from leaking if someone stands to benefit from the leak.  In all 
complex organizations, there are internal politics, external competitors, and 
various other factors that will eventually encourage someone to grab the 
data and run. 

Organizations that have a lot to hide, and face existential risk if their 
secrets are revealed, are the most likely to resort to severe intimidation to 
discourage anyone from leaking data.  It is notable that Julian Assange, 
and Bradley Manning are labelled "terrorists" simply for telling the truth 
about the actions of the USA.  I believe the truth is that the Government of 
the USA is terrified that if the people of USA find out what is being done 
"in the name of the people", those citizens will be ashamed, and will dissolve the
corrupt institutions and put their leaders in jail for the rest of their natural 
lives.
