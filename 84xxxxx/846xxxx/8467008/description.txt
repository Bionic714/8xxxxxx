Thought for the day:  Representative Democracy
When the current system of representative democracy was created in UK, USA, and Canada, 
there were no cars, planes, telephones, and obviously no internet.  It made sense at that
time for local people to select one responsible person who would travel periodically to meet
with other similar representatives to pass new laws and approve corresponding taxes. 

But now we have the internet, which could allow participation in decision making
by a wider body of people. On the good side, diffusing decision making authority makes
it harder to bribe anyone.  On the bad side, diffusing decision making authority means
you have to educate and convince a much wider set of people of a worthwhile idea before
it can be implemented.

I suggest that the legislature should be expanded to include perhaps 100,000 people,
all interconnected and participing using the internet.  Pay for participation
should be nominal.  In all cases, it should be a part-time commitment.  Nobody in the 
legislature should have an "occupation" as a politician, their occupation should be 
something productive.
