  Ball Of Fire precedes the release of the new album, More Tales From The Orbservatory, the follow-up to last yearΓÇÖs stellar collaboration between The Orb and long-time inspiration Lee Scratch Perry; ΓÇÿThe ORBSERVER In The StarhouseΓÇÖ.

  Unsurprisingly the sessions for that album produced more music than one CD could handle, so Scratch, Alex Paterson and Thomas Fehlmann are returning in fine style with this new album. Released June 3rd on Cooking Vinyl, the set features further excursions from last yearΓÇÖs sessions at the Starhouse studio in Berlin, plus new instrumental versions.

  Ball Of Fire Comes complete with a killer selection of dubwise remixes from like-minded low-end explorers Dabrye, Deadbeat and Mad Prosessor, with the latter two delivering both vocal and dub versions.
