Spain.
Suzi Perry hosts live coverage of the Spanish Grand Prix. The Circuit de Catalunya has not been especially kind to British drivers over the years. The last 18 races there have produced just one British winner - Jenson Button in 2009. Lewis Hamilton never won in Spain during his time with McLaren, so the 28-year-old will be hoping for a change in luck with new team Mercedes. However, the man to beat could once again be German star Sebastian Vettel. The Red Bull driver topped the podium in Barcelona in 2011, and is targeting a fourth successive world title this season.
