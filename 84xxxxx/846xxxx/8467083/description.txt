Highlights of the Premier League game between Aston Villa and Chelsea. Villa have endured a difficult season, spending much of the campaign battling to avoid relegation. They were beaten 8-0 in the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge in December, when they suffered their biggest defeat in top-flight history. But the prolific form of Belgian striker Christian Benteke since the turn of the year has helped Paul Lambert's side pick up some vital points. The visitors lifted the Champions League trophy 12 months ago, but need a strong finish to the season if they are to qualify for next year's competition. Interim manager Rafael Benitez won't be in charge of the Blues next season, but he will be determined to end his Stamford Bridge stint on a high by claiming a top-four spot.
