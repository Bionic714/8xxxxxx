Thought for the day:  Crypto Currencies will be issued by Government

Crypto currencies work by having a public record (or log) of all currency 
transactions. The log is continuously available and updated on the internet. 
Instead of showing a persons name next to the coin they 
own, the log shows the public key of the person who owns the coin. 
Anyone who wants to prove they own the coin simply has to produce
the matching private key, and its theirs.  Once a coin is spent, the 
log is updated to show the most recent transaction, and the log shows the 
person receiving the coin now owns it, since the coin now has a new public
key with it. In general, users will create a new public and private key for each
coin they own to ensure nobody inspecting the log can infer that a single person
owns multiple coins. 

Some crypto currencies are designed to have a fixed amount of currency, such as 
Bitcoin that caps at 21 million coins.   Ripple uses the opencoin protocol, and 
has 100 billion coins.  In both cases, it is impossible to change the currency
limit without consent of all users of the system.

Some crypto currencies are designed to ensure anonymity, some are not. 
Bitcoin ensures anonymity provided each coin has a unique public and private key. 
There is literally no way to determine who owns what coin.   The fact that bitcoins
are anonymous makes them attractive for transactions that are inherently illegal. 
It also means that governments cannot collect taxes on those transactions. 
Ripple is different, it provides a tracking database available to government 
authorities to track all transactions, and see who owns what. 

Bitcoins are bearer notes, meaning they are irrevokable once spent. 
For a person accepting payment using bitcoins, there is no counterparty-risk, 
meaning there is no way for a disappointed purchaser to rollback a transaction 
to get their money back. Once its spent, its spent. 

Bitcoin transactions are much like debit card transactions, except no trusted
3rd party is involved, thus no bank.   The transaction cost for a bitcoin transaction
are also negligible, on the order of a hundredth of a penny.  

The fact that accepting bitcoins is very low cost for a seller, with no counter-party
risk means many vendors will be inclined to accept them.  This is a threat to 
sovereign governments who lose sales tax revenue, and ultimately lose income tax revenue. 
With more ways to spend bitcoins, they become more liquid, and this will increase demand
for them, further increasing their utility as a currency, and further enabling bitcoins to 
be used to make illicit payments.   In addition, central banks make lots of money by 
printing currency (at near zero cost), and then lending it out and charging interest.  
This very profitable aspect of central bank operations is also at risk if an 
independent crypto currency became a significant part of the money supply of a country.

Thus central governments (who own central banks) will certainly prohibit transactions 
using bitcoins or any cryptocurrency that they do not issue.

To suppress demand for such independent cryptocurrency, central banks will eventually 
issue their own, but they will not have a cap on the coins issued, thus allowing 
them to continue "managing" the money supply.  They will also keep track of who owns 
each coin, thus discouraging tax evasion and discouraging payment for illicit goods.

The banking sector will lobby against issuing a state sanctioned cryptocurrecy, since it 
canabalizes their debit card business.  Eventually the banks will establish themselves as the
prime nodes producing and updating the public log, and for that they will charge a fee 
that produces enough revenue for them, that they will assist the central bank to roll out 
the new cryptocurrency.
