The dictionary was nicely digitized by wordnik.com, but without illustrations, quotations, and etymology.

Also, there is a partial BGL version of this dictionary. (17mb)

This is one of the greatest dictionaries of the English language. Note that it is from 1911 so it doesn't contain new words (for example "perk" in the sense of "perquisite", does not appear.)
