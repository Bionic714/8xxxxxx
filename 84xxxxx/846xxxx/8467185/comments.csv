Can you please tell me what you are using to capture the Sky HD content and convert it into .mkv?

I've practically pulled my Sky+HD box apart, stripped out the hard drive, tried connecting it to my PC and using 'skycopyplus' etc. but nothing works?  I've tonnes of Sky stuff on my HD box that I'd love to get onto my PC and upload.  Would appreciate a head's up.

Thanks."

Most posters post in Spanish, but they speak English too and I'm sure they'll be able to assist you."
,comfortablynum,2013-05-15T19:10Z,"@Demonoid4Ever, - thanks for that.  Sorry, I thought that you had captured it yourself from SS1 HD and uploaded - was dying to know how you maintained the 720p from an encrypted channel.  Will check out the forum you suggested to see if it shed's any light or becomes another dead-end.  Thanks."
