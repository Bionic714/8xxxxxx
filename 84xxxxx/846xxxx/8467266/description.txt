LUSH

Black Spring EP 1991, cassette, 24-48 FLAC

My cassette is not listed on Discogs, so here's the vinyl link with the same tracks
 
http://www.discogs.com/Lush-Black-Spring/release/638819


Recorded directly from high quality (for JVC) tape deck, no receiver involved.



a1 nothing natural
a2 fallin' in love
a3 god's gift
a4 monochrome



If you wonder where side b is, it's the exact same as side a, so like, ya know, bandwidth.



Enjoy!
