         Football Manager is the best-selling, most realistic football mana-
         gement series ever made. Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years
         of games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an
         array of new features.
         This year's version allows you to take control of any club in more
         than 50 nations across the world and includes all of Europe's biggest
         leagues as well as database of over 500,000 real-world players and
         staff.
         As well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are
         now new ways to enjoy your Football Manager experience.
         The 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything
         on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the players's
         movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air.
         We've also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel
         more realistic and we've made the whole experience more televisual
         by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final
         whistle.

         Instructions:

         -Burn or mount the image
         -Install the game

BTW, is there any genius out there capable of doin some sort of online platform for FM multiplayer? 

PS. If u are goind to defend SEGA or even SI, bare in mind i've bought ""this"" game more than 10 times, and haven't seen any major update besides introduction of Multiple Leagues (around 97), 2D engine (2003?) and 3D engine (which is actually not that of an improvement since gamestyle hasnt changed much, they haven't even adapted the 3D engine from games to trainin, making Training section exactly the same as it was in 2003, though it did have some changes in 2008(?) which were removed in its successor)."

,toniperic,2013-06-05T22:29Z,"Downloaded and installed, copied everything from the ""Crack"" folder into the installation folder and overwrited but when I double-click the icon on the desktop nothing happens. fm.exe is in the processes in the Task Manager but stuck at around 11k memory and nothing eventually ever happens.

What should I do?"
