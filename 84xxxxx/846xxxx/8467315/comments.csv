,Scramblez,2013-05-12T22:50Z,Thank you! You provide a much-appreciated service to all of us in the world who can't get Sky coverage.
,sewalk,2013-05-13T06:22Z,"Many thanks. SkyF1 coverage almost makes me want to live in the UK. Actually, living in the UK would be a huge improvement over where I live now, but I can't afford the move.

Anyway, thanks again, mate. I'm looking forward to Monaco in two weeks."

,vfeore,2013-05-14T23:49Z,"Hahaha! I'm with sewalk, NBC Sports Network in the US is a joke compared to SSF1HD. Thanks to you I can enjoy the proper commentary that F1 deserves. Thanks, smcgill1969!"
