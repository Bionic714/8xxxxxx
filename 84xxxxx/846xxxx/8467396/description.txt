Camilla can set her watch by her hunky rocket-scientist neighbor who jogs past her window each day.

She relishes each glimpse of his shirtless abs, and is dying to see more.

But it's hard to connect with a man who doesn't seem to know she exists...

Ivan feels at home in the lab, not in social situations.

When he finally approaches his attractive neighbor, it's not for a dateùhe wants tutoring in how to behave at an important fundraiser.

Ivan doesn't expect the chemistry between them to be quite so explosive, and is surprised when Cami actually accepts his proposal to embark on a series of "lessons."

Cami soon discovers Ivan's schedule isn't the only thing he likes to be strict aboutùhe needs to be charge in the bedroom as well.

She's shocked at how much she comes to enjoy her submissive side, but wonders if a real relationship is in the equation...
