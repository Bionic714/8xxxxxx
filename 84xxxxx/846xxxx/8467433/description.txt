Review


The Four Wise Men struck me as a true masterpiece.

(Lewis Jones, New Statesman)


A work of extraordinary clarity.

(Jonathan Baumbach, New York Times Book Review)


There is a real touch of magic in this novel.

This is a novel of high achievement. Tournier works to assert an apologia of Christianity and its underlying message of love, and he does so with finely paced arguing, well-balanced counterarguing and, most importantly, genuine intellectual energy... This may be more than a novel of high achievement, in fact; it may be the best work so far of a truly daring writer.
