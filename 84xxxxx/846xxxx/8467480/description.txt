about the author:

James Arthur Crumley (October 12, 1939 ΓÇô September 17, 2008) was the author of violent hardboiled crime novels and several volumes of short stories and essays, as well as published and unpublished screenplays. He has been described as "one of modern crime writing's best practitioners", who was "a patron saint of the post-Vietnam private eye novel" and a cross between Raymond Chandler and Hunter S. Thompson. His book The Last Good Kiss has been described as "the most influential crime novel of the last 50 years."

Crumley had a cult following, and his work is said to have inspired a generation of crime writers in both the U.S. and the U.K, including Michael Connelly, George Pelecanos, Dennis Lehane and Craig McDonald, as well as writers from other genres such as Neal Stephenson, but he never achieved mainstream success.


description:

"When I finally caught up with Abraham Trahearne, he was drinking beer with an alcoholic bulldog named Fireball Roberts in a ramshackle joint just outside of Sonoma, California, drinking the heart out of a fine spring afternoon... "

That's how Detective C. W Sughrue ended one search and began another -- a search for a girl in a dog-eared photo, ten years lost and gone. Now Sughrue has finally hit the big time, hunting down Betty Sue Flowers, the barmaid's beautiful daughter.

Who, what, and where is Betty Sue Flowers? ... Ask the men who knew her, but never well enough ... ask the mobster who wants her dead... the friend who says she is ... But don't ask Sughrue -- who's putting his life on the line for 87 bucks and a passionate obsession for a girl in a dog-eared photo.
