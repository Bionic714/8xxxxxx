Lord of The Rings: The Third Age | Gamecube

Best played with Dolphin Gamecube Emulator v3.5

This torrent contains two .iso files, start by using the first one until you reach Rohan, around there the game will freeze and that's when you switch to the second .iso file, and whenever you want to go back before that (travel, side quest etc.) you have to switch back to the first .iso file.

System requirements are nothing special GPU and RAM is nothing a laptop would do, but it's recommended that you have a CPU clocked at, at least, 3.5GHz if you want to run this game at decent speed. Keep that in mind.
