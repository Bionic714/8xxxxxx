Perception is a fortieth-anniversary edition twelve-disc boxset by The Doors. The CDs contain the 1999 remastered
editions of all the Jim Morrison albums, while the DVD-Audio discs contain new (2006) 40th Anniversary surround
remixes of them as well as visual extras.
Each album includes extra tracks consisting of previously unreleased session outtakes.

The Doors were one of those bands that made a big impression on me; from the stormy 70s until this day on.
In my collection are all LPs, some MCs, and all CDs of this legendary band.
Without a doubt this boxset beats the lot for its brilliant audio quality, best Remaster Ive heard in a very long time.
