,maddog7777,2013-05-13T05:30Z,Let me explain for all you morons posting this video out and misleading folks with the Title. R6 is China region yes! However this is not a DVD release e but rather a Cam-Rip with new audio. So take out the R6 please because this did not come from a DVD from that Region. THANK YOU KINDLY!  A4 – V1.5
,ShAaNiG,2013-05-13T06:07Z,"I think you watching this on 40 inch screens?
Why not complain to the source group because they label this R6. I personally believe this encode is really watchable as movie just out on theater few days ago.

If you looking for bluray then i strongly suggest you to wait 2-3 months before searching BR again."
,maddog7777,2013-05-13T07:26Z,"@ShAnNig- Just because they labeled it an R6 does not mean you have too. If they jumped off of a building, would you too? It is a cam and should be addressed as a Cam-rip. Not even sure how they concluded it was an R6 when it did not come off of a DVD in the first place. I was actually watching it on a small 19 inch monitor. I have no problem with it being a crappy quality copy, but label it truthfully and do not copy and paste something someone else wrote is all I am saying."
,ShAaNiG,2013-05-13T08:32Z,"I am still saying if you compare this to normal cam print then totally not fair. This source is far better then cam sources for sure.

wait 2 months buddy, there is lots of peoples who just can't wait for 2 months so they prefer to watch these kind of qualities."
,agyagasztal,2013-05-13T14:32Z,"DVD rips does not have vignette (means: darker corners, brighter center). Camrips do. Whether it's sharper or blurrier or made with a HD cam to 1080p, the contrast, brightness and vignette always makes it very clear whether it's made with a cam.
For some reason recently there's a trend to label various camrips as dvdscr, r# or even dvdrip. I'd not expect quality uploaders to follow :I"
,maddog7777,2013-05-16T10:34Z,"@ShAaNiG- You refer this to cam sources and say this is better than cam sources out there! Not sure if you actually watched this or not, but it is a cam source and nothing more! Its not a DVDrip or an R6 line source, but rather a basic HD camera source. That is why I say keep that out of the title and stop posting what others are posting so people know exactly what it is. As for waiting 2 months! Some countries like Russia and china get their media on DVD since a lot of theaters are digital now and when I see R6 line, I automatically assume DVD line source from that region because that us what the title is saying. So that being said! It is labeled wrong! I had one guy tell me R6 is the Camera source for Region 6. Are you kidding me? LMAO. Cameras sources are broken down into two groups. PAL and NTSC - R6 (line) Means DVD source from region 6 China. The source is just a plain old camera and nothing more. So I tell it like it is so people who do not want camrips to be warned of false titles from people that are only looking for people to download their garbage torrents. Sorry! "
