These questions and many more are answered in this touching and insightful narrative. This is a book of hope and encouragement to all parents with an interest in home schooling.
Review

'This is a very encouraging book for anyone who doubts their ability to home educate a child with Asperger's, or who may be fearful about not being able to cope with the demands from their child 24/7. It is well worth sifting through for the wise insights and practical tips. In addition the author promotes the idea of self care for the weary parent. A nicely balanced, positive book.' - Education Otherwise'Choosing Home will empower parents with its realistic portrayal of the challenges and rewards of homeschooling a child with Aspergers.' - Home Education Magazine
