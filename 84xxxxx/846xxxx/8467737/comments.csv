1. Start the game with MountContent = 1
2. The locales will be missing
3. Go to the flag to the bottom right and click on it
4. Only hungarian (I think it is) will be available
5. Click it
6. The menu and all strings are now in Hungarian
7. Click the flag symbol again
8. All the locales will now be visible
9. Select your preferred locale, even English will work
10.All the strings will now be in that locale"
