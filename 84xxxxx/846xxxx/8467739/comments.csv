[T],geogaddi000,2013-05-20T01:12Z,"Many of these videos are incomplete and not edited.  They were recorded from a LiveStream.  For those interested in the full videos, I highly recommend purchasing an unlimited pass for $3.80 [four bucks!!] from CitizenHearing.org  - You get access to the full hearing indefinitely.  Can't go wrong..."

,goodhearted,2013-05-30T18:20Z,"Dear geogaddi000 and patapum. Thank you so much for the upload! I share as much as possible. May I kindly suggest Money and Life movie also, which promotes complementary currencies? And Unity the movie will be the next similar big film like Sirius and this latter one.

I would like to kindly ask you if you could upload David Wilcock's GaiamTV episodes from http://gaiamTV.com/DavidWilcock , perhaps in a bundle, since he also teaches about ETs (see the bottom of that page) and this material is available nowhere else. I don't have the means to buy it every month (even though it's pennies for people in the Western world).

Another wish, please allow this: could you manage to somehow get and upload Energy from the Vacuum full series? I managed to download it until 18 but without part 20 DVD2 and part 19 and part 11A. 

The author of these, Tom Bearden is mentioned by Steven Greer in some of his videos, and has been a close partner of his, I truly believe that with John Bedini (also featured in the DVD series) they are the top vacuum-energy experts today.

Unfortunately, I have a 1Mb upload speed, so I couldn't upload it even if I could buy it, and these latter 3 DVDs were added later than when the first box was published.

Could you please help humanity with this. If only I would have the money, I would buy the hole damn thing altogether and somehow manage to upload it to the world. Just check Google trends for free energy, vacuum energy, countries with huuge populations have the most searches. And it's so frustrating that I cannot help because I am poor of money, and I find no-one in my circle of friends and others to help in such an endeavour. Here's the list, http://energyfromthevacuum.com/DVDListforpurchase.htm .
Hugs anyways."
[T],geogaddi000,2013-06-01T07:38Z,"@goodhearted:  I'll see what I can do.  I haven't come across the newer Energy from the Vacuum.  But I think 11a is posted in one of the archives available on BitTorrent.  I know I have it somewhere.  I think most of those videos were circulated on Demonoid.  I do know that the maker of the DVDs was rather upset about them leaking out, especially since he said the proceeds from the DVDs go to help Tom Bearden's medical bills.  He is pushing 75 years old or more now."
