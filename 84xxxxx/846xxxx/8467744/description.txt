Release Notes:



SOLDOUT, the electronic duo founded by Charlotte and David in 2004, is coming

out with a new album: ΓÇ£MOREΓÇ¥. The album was recorded and produced over an entire

year (2012), in the bandΓÇÖs own studio in Brussels. It was mixed by Elsa Grelot

and Thomas Sari, and mastered by Simon Davey at The Exchange in London. ΓÇ£MOREΓÇ¥

is the bandΓÇÖs third studio album after the initial electro pop album ΓÇ£Stop

TalkingΓÇ¥ (2004) and the more radical and experimental ΓÇ£CutsΓÇ¥ (2008).

From the onset, Charlotte and David explored, with passion, the possibilities

offered by electronic music, and sought to express a contrast, a collision of

sounds, and feelings springing from their separate particular universes. With

ΓÇ£MOREΓÇ¥, SOLDOUT returns with a singular sound and an identity that is

increasingly asserted. In their songs, obscurity is mixed with tenderness, and

violence with fragility. This enables us look into their private lives through

personal stories, and makes us want to find out more.
