New scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate metadata and pagination, etc.


This is an anthology of sword and sorcery short stories with female heroes. The perspective is refreshingly feminist. I picked this up when I was a kid and loved it; still do. The great Michael Whelan cover image inspired my imagination for many years.

The title is a bit misleading: the focus is not on amazons as such.
