    [Notes]



    2013 album from the Alt-Rock pioneers, an album of covers of songs the band

    says have had a big influence on them. The tracks covered range from glam

    rock (Queen's 'Best Friend') to Mod Rock (The Jam's 'Art School'), with

    plenty of Hard Rock and even Divine's "Female Trouble" thrown in for good

    measure. Everybody Loves Sausage also features several guest musicians like

    Mudhoney's Mark Arm and Neurosis' Scott Kelly, as well as some tracks

    recorded by the Melvins Lite lineup of Buzz Osborne, Dale Crover, and Trevor

    Dunn.
