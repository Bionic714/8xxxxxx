,maddog7777,2013-05-13T05:39Z,Let me explain again for all you morons posting this video out and misleading folks with the Title. R6 is China region yes! However this is not a DVD release e but rather a Cam-Rip with new audio. So take out the R6 please because this did not come from a DVD from that Region. THANK YOU KINDLY!  A4 – V1.5….Not an R6 – not an R5 – Not a DVDrip of any kind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,maddog7777,2013-05-13T07:29Z,"@rcr29budcar - Sorry the truth hurts, but if people are going to post torrents, then please post what it actually is and not because they read it somewhere else. Frankly it makes them look like idiots, especially this not being an R6 line copy! It should read Iron Man 2013 Cam-Rip New Audio....."
,crumrugin,2013-05-13T19:13Z,you get em maddog I agree completely If know one speaks up we will dl a bunch of shit when there are REAL dvd video copies around 
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T00:01Z,"@crumrugin- They keep posting this up...lol The sad part is. A lot of people do not know the difference between a CAMrip and a DVDrip, but those who have skulls next to their names are experienced torrent uploaders should know better than to falsely mislead people into downloading their garbage. People get mad when they hear the truth. But I want people to know that this is not a R6 line source, but rather a CAMrip... "
