,maddog7777,2013-05-13T05:27Z,Okay let me explain for all you morons posting this video out and misleading folks with the Title. R6 is China region yes! However this is not a DVD release e but rather a Cam-Rip with new audio. So take out the R6 please because this did not come from a DVD from that Region. THANK YOU KINDLY!  A4 – V2... Not an R6 line
,rcr29budcar,2013-05-13T05:49Z,"Wow, dude, you suck! If you hadn't put it togather yet, maddog is a troll!
Your misleading folks by putting a poor rating on an obvious bootleg, that is very good quality among bootleg movies. Better than most."
,maddog7777,2013-05-13T07:20Z,"Nope not a troll! just trying to figure out why people keep writing R6 line in the torrent heading when this did not come from an R6 DVD media bur from a cam. They only use this so people will DL their shit. Sorry if it upsets people, but oh well. As for quality! You really need to get your eyes checked, because this is not a great quality copy."
,FlubsyMcdoodle,2013-05-13T07:49Z,"thanks for the upload, at least i can fucking hear the audio in this one. 
V - 8
A - 8"

,crumrugin,2013-05-13T19:09Z,"maddog is right . R6 moniker should have DVD video, not a cam EVER"
,kennkid,2013-05-13T22:18Z,good quality..thankz 
,benjisan,2013-05-15T05:31Z,"For a CAM, def not an R6 bootleg / DVD, just an R6 CAM mind you.

Very watchable quality.
Setup: HDMI output to 48"" plasma with 7.1 Optical audio
V: 8/10 (I didn't see any notes on it being adjusted, if this is the raw feed it is quite amazing.)
A: 9/10
I'm giving it this for the following reasons:
1. For a CAM (remember fuck-noobs ""CAM"") it's very normalized.  Normally CAMs require turning up talking scenes and turning down action scenes before my ears bleed.
2. It's clear at NORMAL volumes.  Too often I have to turn VLC to 160%+ and turn my surround up quite high to hear the quieter talking scenes
3. I've sampled 4 10-min segments.  No audience, no cam-guy coughing or opening chips.
Due to all this, glad it got a new audio line.

Also R0thschild, big fan of yours. Prob the first non-hqpdb torrent of yours I've DL'd

,maddog7777,2013-05-16T04:44Z,No such thing as an R6 Cam!!!!!!!! Its PAL or NTSC. R6 stands for region but when you label it R6 line means DVD from region 6 (China) A cam is listed as Cam and not R6 Cam.. Sorry to correct people who are not understanding how to label things correctly!
,nevyn68,2013-05-20T03:25Z,"Just ignore all the crap written above.
This was a very decent copy if you can get over the hard coded Chinese translations.
(Every now and again)
For a cam
A:9
V:8
Worth downloading. :)"
