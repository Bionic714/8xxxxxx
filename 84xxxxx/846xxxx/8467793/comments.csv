,maddog7777,2013-05-13T05:26Z,Okay let me explain for all you morons posting this video out and misleading folks with the Title. R6 is China region yes! However this is not a DVD release e but rather a Cam-Rip with new audio. So take out the R6 please because this did not come from a DVD from that Region. THANK YOU KINDLY!  A4 – V2.......ASSHATS

And its a hell of allot better than the rating you gave it.  If you don't like it, don't dl it!  An honest rating would be approx. A-7.5-8 and the V-8.  For a ""cam"", this is a great copy.  Well worth the time to download it."
,yaboo_56,2013-05-13T06:17Z,"Cam?  Best Cam I've ever seen then and the audio is top knotch compared to the previous tin can jobs.  Video is a tad small so may be a bit shitty on a big screen.

It's free , who fucking cares . Thanks again Bone !!"
,IncomePitbull,2013-05-16T09:07Z,"BONE - I expect better from you.. but your no different than all the other skulls here.. I appreciate your work, I do.. but you know damn well this isnt an R6. R6 is a region code AFAIK and has nothing to do with quality. I guess people got tired of R5, so they made up R6.. or maybe a big rip of a movie, came from an R6 (China?) DVD source.. So they put R6 in the title (which they would have been correct for that one).. However, dumbasses who didn't know any different started putting R6 on everything with quality between a TS and DVD??

Bone I know you probably get your shit from a distro source of some sorts. A pool of the new shit. I used to serve in TMD on IRC and had access to their distro bot (who had rips days/weeks before released to the public usually). We grabbed from the distro, then shared it to the public.

So I know you didn't come up with the name/title of this torrent. However, You DO KNOW that this isn't an R6.. So either say it in the title, or at LEAST correct it in the description... ""Guys, source says R6 but they are morons, it really is xxx"".. If your source says it was a BRip when it was a cam, would you post it here as a BluRay rip?

So stop posting whatever the fuck your source claims it is, and fix the name yourself!

I thought TS movies where CAM video and audio plugged into a source, like the handicap audio jack..? When you guys post LINE as the title, it's usually that same quality.. So which one is it, a TS or LINE.. Pick one, choose one, make it an industry standard.. so the rest of the population can adjust and know wtf your talking about.

So many Indians, and not enough Chiefs. Shit like this happens, when you don't have someone setting standards, and let people run amuck and do whatever they want. The average person just isn't smart enough to use common sense.

However, I do know this is not an R6. Right now, this is the best source. I believe this has spotty korean subs (would be nice to let people know that too, so when/if there is a version without them, people can pick with or without and not get surprised!).. The screens look really good for a CAM. And this new audio source, I hear is good too. So it makes for a above normal cam!

So BONE, thank you for your work... Lets just try to fix the mess with all the nonsense false titles. It's like the sources or uploaders are trying to bring ""marketing"" into the scene to get more downloads.. Sneaky tactics like, oh if i call this cam an r6 they will all think its badass quality and I will be the ub3r l337 dud3 that shared it...

Stop trying to trick us to get more downloads.. Stop trying to trick us to get more fame.. Just call shit like it is, and let us have the correct information, so we can pick the version that suits us!

I have watched shitty cams and been satisfied! So don't start with the ""quit bitchin its free"" speech! This shit has to do with misconception, deceit, and bullshit.. not the quality of the cam, but that these sources/groups/uploaders are trying to pass off shitty 3rd world country cams off as HD shit, with half the movie missing or in another language. You gotta draw the line somewhere!"
,maddog7777,2013-05-16T10:22Z,"@IncomePitbull- I even have some saying this is an R6 cam version... lmao... I keep telling these morons that there is no such thing as an R6 cam version. Its a cam version plain and simple. R6 only means it came from China and the (words line) means DVDrip. But they keep referring to his as a R6 Camera used. I keep telling them it is either Pal or NTSC is the camera source. I am a film student and like you, we know the difference, but there are people out there who are expecting a DVD source from this title and I know some countries like Russia and China get digital media for their theaters and it is possible, but this is not an R6 (line). It is a Basic CamRip with new audio. They only do it so people will download their crap. How else do they get skulls by their names! They lie and make up fake titles so people rush to download it. Sure it might be a good camrip to some, but that is all it is. So people downloading this, this is only a Camera Rip and not a R6 line.. Heads up for those expecting a DVD quality picture. The audio is a 4 and to me the video is a 2 because I do not like camrip versions myself personally. "
