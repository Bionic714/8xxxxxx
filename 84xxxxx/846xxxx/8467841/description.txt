Lynda.Interactive.Data.Visualization.with.Processing-PLATODate: 2012-09-29 Disks: xx/34: Start communicating ideas and diagramming data in a more
interactive way. In this course, author Barton Poulson
shows how to read, map, and illustrate data with
Processing, an open-source drawing and development
environment. On top of a solid introduction to Processing
itself, this course investigates methods for obtaining and
preparing data, designing for data visualization, and
building an interactive experience out of a design. When
your visualization is complete, explore the options for
sharing your work, whether uploading it to specialized
websites, embedding the visualizations in your own web
pages, or even creating a desktop or Android app for your
work
