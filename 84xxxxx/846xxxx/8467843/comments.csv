,bozo5,2013-05-13T00:52Z,hey all this is my first upload.  let me know of any problems.
,a2dogs222,2013-05-13T06:37Z,You did a good job and a public service keeping alive the Gong Show dream. This is a rarity. It did a small VHS release then disappeared. I love when we can get hard-to-find stuff back in circulation.
,bozo5,2013-05-13T07:26Z,"thanks for the feedback.  i knew this was rare, at least in the torrent world because i've been looking for it for a long time too.   it's great to get this out in the world knowing that it's been an incomplete file for who knows how long.  "

,bozo5,2013-05-14T04:21Z,WOOHOO it's a party!  we got blessed that this was findable.   i looked for this off and on for at least a couple years.
