,maddog7777,2013-05-13T05:26Z,Okay let me explain for all you morons posting this video out and misleading folks with the Title. R6 is China region yes! However this is not a DVD release e but rather a Cam-Rip with new audio. So take out the R6 please because this did not come from a DVD from that Region. THANK YOU KINDLY!  A4 – V2
,yTSa6,2013-05-13T05:41Z,"R6 occasionally aPPEARS AS WELL. this just means the source is region 6
...

,rcr29budcar,2013-05-13T05:46Z,Maddog is a douchebag
,maddog7777,2013-05-13T07:18Z,"@-yTSa6- so if everyone jumps off a bridge, you will too? Just because every other idiot is labeling it an R6 does not mean he has too. It is not an R6 line which refers to coming off a DVD from a region 6 media. It did not so it should not be included into the torrent title because it is in fact misleading for people who do not know. Sorry if it upsets some people, but I do not care who gets mad. Stop posting wrong information in hopes people DL your torrents. "
,crumrugin,2013-05-13T18:58Z,"I agree with maddog , even tho he comes across as a meanie "
,crumrugin,2013-05-13T19:03Z,"One problem (a trend) with r6 AUDIO, I've found is the mid bass is boosted thru the roof as if everyone is supposed to watch it thru tiny ipad speakers, I hate when people fuck up the audio"
,yTSa6,2013-05-13T20:59Z,"This clearly not a DVD.
R6 indicates the cam source
Different regions sometime do and in this case they did Get different versions of the film.

I see no reason to change the title of provided by the group that released this.

For many the regional source of the cam is important.

I suggest you read the faq listed here or use Google

,maddog7777,2013-05-13T23:54Z,"I am not trying to be mean! This R6 means it came from a DVD from region 6 which is from China. They do not rate cam sources in R's. This is not a DVD source and people who know the difference will be quite upset when they are in fact expecting a DVDrip from an R6 line. R6 should not even be mentioned here at all. Now if they had said something to the effect of: This is a cam source from china then that would be cool, but they made it seem like it was a DVD source. Even if they had wrote in the description below saying this is actually a cam would be cool too, but this is totally misleading! They only post it this way so people will DL their crap knowing people will be expecting a R6 line source. Just because it came from China does not make it an R6 line. R6 line means it came from a DVDrip!!!! plain and simple! "
,yTSa6,2013-05-14T00:30Z,"I did not create the R6 use on cams.
If you would read the FAQ or use google you would find out that region codes are being used by the groups the create the cam releases to indicate the region of the cam source.

no where in this release is there an indication that it is a DVD nor I would think that any reasonable person would assume iron man 3 is out on dvd yet."
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T06:56Z,"@yTSa6-If this was a screener, you would put screener right? If this is a Camrip, you would put Camrip right? Well obviously not because you did not. And fYI R6 is not the cam rip version for the region. Only idiots label it that way because they do not know any better! R6 (line) means it came from a DVD source from that region and not a Camrip! I do not care what false information from google your getting because R6 line means DVd source and not a Camrip sorry!"
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T07:01Z,One more thing! When you see an R5 line which is from Russia. You will probably not find one that is a camrip because they know what they are doing and how to label their stuff right. And some countries like Russia seem to get access to DVD's faster than most. You will not find them posting camrips without labeling it as camrips. 
,yTSa6,2013-05-14T22:40Z,"@maddog7777
It seems you do understand. 
You just don't agree with the way the releases are being named. Well I don't like the whole naming system either, but I understand it.
When I pass on a release I don't change the name, doing so would cause people to download thinking they are getting something different which is what you seem to be complaining about.

If everybody started changing the name the way they saw fit, you'd see 20 listings for the same thing but with differant titles so you'd end up downloading them all only to find they were the same.
If they are all named the way they were released you'd see 20 listings of the same title and then only have to decide which one download. "
,maddog7777,2013-05-15T05:03Z,"@yTSa6 - So basically your calling yourself an idiot who follows others and not how it should be labeled. Just because they label it wrong does not mean everyone has to follow the lead of the stupid who do not know the difference between a R6 line (DVD source) as oppose to a Camrip which this is. I would expect someone who knows the difference to post it correctly, but since you do not then your excused and it is okay if your a moron. Learn what R6 line means! I am letting people know this is a Camrip only! "
,maddog7777,2013-05-15T05:05Z,"@yTSa6 - It obvious you only label it this way so people will download your torrents, because if you told people what it really is, they will not download it. Learn your shit bro and understand the abbreviations and what they actually mean before you embarrass yourself with your lack of intelligence. Thank You -Case closed!"
