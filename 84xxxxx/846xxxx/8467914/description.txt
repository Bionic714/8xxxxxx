Thought for the day: Copyright needs reform.

When copyright was first introduced it only covered useful books
with practical value, such as maps, and navigational tables.   The idea
was that these kinds of documents took great effort to assemble and needed
some protection. 

Since then, copyright maximalists have extended what copyright covers, and 
extended its duration.  The current situation is absurd. 

One silly outcome is that the benefits of copyright extension do not 
actually benefit the original authors. In most cases, the literary agent, 
or publisher, or perhaps the authors estate are the only beneficiaries. 

Subverting a bad law is every citizens duty.  I am doing mine!
