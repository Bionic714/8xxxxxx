,soviet001,2013-05-20T09:31Z,"Thanks again dibya... Love how seeing ""DibyaTPB"" beside any torrent, knowing that we'll be getting no-nonsense PublicHD goodness i.e., just the movie and 1 txt file from the great publichd.se site itself; no stupid .nfo files that are full of holes and are hard to read, making a mockery of people who could much more easily click 'mediainfo' in the file and see anything they want...the nfo was already posted with the torrent ul anyway! 

And to really try and hit the point home: .nof's are just a waste of some other poor creature's time, who's trying to make ascii that isn't ascii anymore. No skill required to make every single symbol exactly the same in 'ascii art/nfo' -- not to rail on older or the ""traditional"" ascii writers who made nice little presentations. But seriously, those things are illegible and bereft of most of the even basic yet important mediainfo data!

:)

Dibya you keep on soldiering on!! You the best. "

OH and DIBYA will prob never read this, what with the millions of uploads you do dibz, how will we small folk ever hear your words in non-major movies etc.? ;. ((

DIBYA___ just 1 QUESTION from your hugest, biggest, largest FAN (I guess.. tho I am way too skinny, and not remotely huge) -----> WHEREABOUTS are you LOCATED? or in otherwords, WHAT COUNTRY/REGION OF THE WORLD are YOU from? =] 

been dying to know if you're really not u.s.-based, because you somehow give off a u.s. - vibe (in a good way..)"
,soviet001,2013-05-20T09:51Z,"Shit, just realized, I meant to dl EPISODE *21* not 20!! Ugh. And spent like 30 mins writing weird comments due to my current state. Ugh. Got work to do and no sleep tonight but look at me.. "
