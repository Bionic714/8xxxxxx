These videos represent only 9 of over 100 videos in ORIGINAL JKD as taught by "Ted Wong/TC" but I don't have the rest. I had these videos for some time and decided to upload them do to the lack of quality JKD videos available on the net. If I get more in the future, I will upload them. But, in any way, you can get an idea of what this training entails and, if you like them, subscribe yourself.

Notes:

1. Use vlc player to view the videos.

2. For anyone familiar with JKD, you should know what the abbreviation TC represents (the vagueness is for a reason) in JKD regarding Ted Wong, who represents JKD as taught by Bruce Lee at the time of his death, adherents. AND Ted Wong is not in the videos.

3. In my opinion, some of the videos are superflous (to fill space to make more money) becuase JKD only has about "7 hand techniques, 7 kicking techniques and 7 footworks plus one single On-guard stance" or according to Teri Tom, "4 or five punches, 3 or 4 kicks, and a few grppling techniques."
