i've got another controversial and classic name for you...
THE LAST TANGO IN PARIS 1972(marlon brando)
(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070849/)
you surely wanna do that!!!
and besides this i will be xtrmly happy if you encode the 1080p of I AM LOVE (2009)
(http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226236/?ref_=sr_3)
Sources are available...no hurry,whatever u upload is fine with me!!! keep sharing :)"
,jalucian,2013-05-16T14:27Z,"Any interest from anyone for Memento in 1080p with an optional second director's commentary audio track? There are several decent 1080 encodes of Memento, but very few that have the commentary track included. "
,dalesteyn,2013-05-18T16:16Z,"why not..i've got the movie in 1080p(sujaidr rip),but the bitrate is too low..
donno about the others but I definitely want ur rip(good bitrates,with director's commentary)"
,onlyHD,2013-05-18T20:44Z,"Of course yes :)

I found a remastered 720p (but not 1080p) edition here https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6488510/Memento.2000.REMASTERED.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi

But if you feel like peers might be low, then i think you can upload just the commentary track.
It's totally your decision, i am just suggesting,"
