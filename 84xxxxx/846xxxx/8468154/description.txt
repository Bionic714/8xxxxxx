Notes:

Fantastic movie with an all-star cast. This movie has finally been released on blu-ray so now there can be legitimate 1080p versions. My earlier 720p was from a 720p HD non-blu-ray source because up until May 6, 2013, there was no blu-ray release. As of the day of this was uploaded, it still hasn't been fully released, but the May 6th date was when the blu-ray was released for those who pre-ordered. So, if you have the 720p, you may wish to replace it with this. Enjoy.
