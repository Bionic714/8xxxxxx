Thought for the day: MOOCs are great, unless you are a professor.

MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) will fundamentally change 
how post-secondary education is delivered.  They will weaken the strength 
of universty teacher unions.  They will allow students to participate
regardless of geographic location, or economic wealth.  Increasingly 
courses will become "star professor" driven, where the top professors
(from the top schools) have huge enrollment, and other less well known
instructors are ignored.  State and provincial governments will create 
online universities, consisting entirely of MOOCs, in order to offer 
courses and degrees with full credentials.  This will be done partly to 
serve remote students in rural areas, but mainly to force the existing urban
universities to accept MOOC course equivalents for their degree programs.
The importance of colleges, which teach practical skills which demand
hands-on training with specific equipment and tools will increase. 
Online courses have difficulty competing in this area of course.
