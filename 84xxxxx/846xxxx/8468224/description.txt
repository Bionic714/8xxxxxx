From the Infowars web site :: On this Sunday, May 12 live transmission of The Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the global crime syndicate's activities as growing numbers of people respond to brazen moves to impose a high-tech tyranny on humanity. 

Alex looks at the far ranging implications of Benghazigate and what it portends for Obama, the politically motivated attempt by the Internal Revue Service to undermine the patriot movement, and the militarized police state reaction to homeschoolers and others deciding not to participate in the establishment's indoctrination prison system passing as public education.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
