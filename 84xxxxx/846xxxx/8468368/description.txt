This is my Dreamcast emulated version, which works very well on 32bit OS, I don't think it works on 64 bit, but I'm not sure. I have tested this on Windows 7 32 bit only.

Use the icon on your desktop to begin, a screen will appear, go to "System" & press "Start".

I have put a picture of the default controls within the game dir, the Xpadder profiles are mapped to that configuration.

I'm uploading this because I downloaded this version:

but it didn't work for me, so I put together an emulated version which works with NVidia cards as well.
