Thought for the day: Copying is not Theft

Copyright infringement is often called theft, but it isn't.  If a 
copy is made of a digital file, the original is still perfectly 
workable.  Its not really theft if the person with the first copy is 
no worse off.  On the other hand, making a copy does dilute the 
scarcity of the original file.  But why should society protect and prolong 
a condition of scarcity.  In many situations, people that try to profit from 
scarcity are universally despised, such as people who hoard food during a 
famine. Gold is scarce, but if I find a new nugget, then gold is slightly 
less scarce yet nobody says I stole the value from other holders of gold.
The bottom line is if technology allows easy copying, then there is no
point passing a law against it.  Trying to stop sharing is like trying to 
stop water from running downhill.  It's a poor use of legal resources to 
waste time working against gravity.
