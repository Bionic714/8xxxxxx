,darkizzle,2013-05-13T04:19Z,"Damn! Did not expect Stannis to crash Sansa and Tyrion's wedding! It was a pleasant change from the books, when he only came to attack King's Landing and fight one on one with Tywin! And three shadow babies at once! This show keeps getting better and better! spoliors  "

,notzelda,2013-05-13T05:56Z,seed! and stop posting spoilers!
,BCBuddy,2013-05-13T05:57Z,"I always think it's a bit funny (not to mention sad--imagine the lonely lives they must lead, seriously) when someone tries to post a spoiler of a movie or TV show based on an extremely popular book. Like saying Jesus dies in the end of The Passion."
,bryk,2013-05-13T06:31Z,So Cersei has a kid with her brother and then beds her own son from her brother Joffrey? My head is reeling from all the incest.
,bryk,2013-05-13T06:33Z,"@Ttones: is Ttones the same as Titties? No, right? Same here."
,Tshamblin,2013-05-13T07:07Z,"Someone should probably mention that this torrent is broken, video doesn't even play. And all the spoilers aren't true."
,explojoseph,2013-05-13T07:30Z,"LOL DARKIZZLE YOUR AWESOME!!! i love it. bullshit spoilers! [= i acutally tripped out the first couple times you ""spoiled"" the episode! better this guy than someone who actually talks about actual spoilers"
,explojoseph,2013-05-13T07:32Z,"@Tshamblin

video does play. you either dont have the right codec or correct media player. 

VLC Media player is your best friend. download it. its free, and plays nearly every type of video file.

on a side note, did you honestly think this video was broken with 2 identical uploads and over 6000 seeds between the two (not counting leechers). your kinda dumb bro... use common sense. not to mention this is uploaded by the infallible EZTV."
,Mctatarka,2013-05-13T09:10Z,"Darkizzle, you're so full of shit :D"
,Lauchis,2013-05-13T09:15Z,"Wonderful, thanks!"
