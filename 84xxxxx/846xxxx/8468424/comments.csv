,knoxius,2013-05-13T04:33Z,you should go fuck yourself for spoiling
,rileybrown2,2013-05-13T04:40Z,WARNING DO NOT READ DARKIZZLE'S COMMENT.
,Canadian_KO,2013-05-13T04:43Z,"@darkizzle
...thanks for that..."
,slayerh4x,2013-05-13T04:49Z,"Dark, you're wasting your life."
,canopener,2013-05-13T04:49Z,"@darkizzle - Not exactly sure if what you say is correct, but if it is, it's in extremely bad form to spoil a major plot point for the rest of us - regardless if it's in the book or not. "
,Timbo6669,2013-05-13T04:49Z,That seriously never happens..HE trolls around here all the time...Ive read the books...that doesnt happen guys/girls..
,MadKing101,2013-05-13T04:52Z,.
,VssLeaderx13,2013-05-13T04:59Z,seed?
,HKCannibal,2013-05-13T05:00Z,Thanks a lot eztv!
,darkizzle,2013-05-13T05:01Z,"Now one of the dragons are dead. I knew this scene was coming but it still hurts as much as in the book! Dany will be furious though and burn down all of Slaver's Bay, so its worth it. Also sad when Ygritte fell off the wall, but there's a red priest nearby to revive her so its all good. *splitters*"
,VssLeaderx13,2013-05-13T05:03Z,0.7% progress !!!
,jRoldo,2013-05-13T05:06Z,"if what timbo says is true at least he was nice enough to fake troll

spoiling the actual plot would be fucked up 0.-"
,RIYDER,2013-05-13T05:14Z,HAHAHA!! Darkizzle makes my fucking day every time. Just amazing entertainment watching peoples reactions.......brilliant. 
,rredexx,2013-05-13T05:27Z,any subs up yet??
,gameofgroans,2013-05-13T05:40Z,"B.s. Darkizzle, Ygritte dies when Jon Snow betrays her!

Each week we inch closer and closer to Robb and Catelyn's death at the Red Wedding! Talisa is a Lannister spy and will be the first one to plunge a dagger into Robb's back. THE NORTH REMEMBERS!!!!"
,Violentos,2013-05-13T06:01Z,"I don't know if it's because people aren't seeding or what, but I'm downloading this at about an average of 20 KB/s. It's been about 1 hour and 30 mins so far and it's 68% done..."
,Toby196,2013-05-13T06:13Z,"Thanks, eztv."
,Doomrulz,2013-05-13T06:50Z,!!!!!!!!  DON'T READ THE COMMENTS   !!!!!
,DarkC3ll,2013-05-13T07:09Z,Why are there so many more leechers than seeders?  it will go faster for everyone if everyone seeds...
,pirate_share_the_love,2013-05-13T07:23Z,So audio and video quality is ok i'm assuming by so much discussion about the spoiler?
,SoldierNThug,2013-05-13T07:25Z,"OMG THIS EPISODE IS SO AWESOME

I really loved the part where Tom Hardy told Peter Baelish his plan to crash the plane with no survivors,
most memorable scene ever"
,Alrik88,2013-05-13T07:38Z,"[spoiler]jon snow dies and becomes a whitewalker, joffry rapes sansa to death with a crossbow bolt[/spoiler] "

,pirate_share_the_love,2013-05-13T10:07Z,"Yup episode is good quality again, as 99% of eztv eps are. Guess I'm still warry from the one that was out of sinc near the end a few weeks back. 

Quality stuff, Long live the uploaders and seeders!"
,RiriG,2013-05-13T11:08Z,"http://subscene.com/subtitles/game-of-thrones-third-season/english/729676

English subtitles !"
,xxkevman,2013-05-13T11:27Z,"Quick question,
Why are some downloads 1.4 GiB and others of the same length around 440 MiB?

And both seem to be of the same quality.

Sorry for being such a noob, just curious."
,RavenousRaven,2013-05-13T11:31Z,THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE CONTRIBUTION! CAN'T WAIT FOR EPISODE 8!

,erzeleng,2013-05-13T12:13Z,"@xxkevman

same episode, same length, different quality. the other one's better when watching in large monitors (720p). this small version's faster to download and can work pretty well in netboooks and small laptops."
,ZoPunde,2013-05-13T12:29Z,betch
,diverdiva,2013-05-13T13:02Z,Ignore darkizzle - his spoilers are bs and good entertainment value for the reactions he gets! BUT DON'T read gameofgroans' comments - he's a genuine spoiler and a total tosser!
,horizon91,2013-05-13T13:12Z,da faq!!! 100000+ seeders hahahaahah!!!
,lords43,2013-05-13T14:16Z,"@horizon91

holy shit! the highest amount of seeders I have ever seen!"
,naiya726,2013-05-13T15:17Z,"I have been downloading torrents from you EZ for years!  For a while now I have been noticing how slow the torrents are. I started a torrent from you that had over 8k more seeds than ETTV and his torrent was done 40 minutes earlier with the same quality as yours and I started his torrent 30 minutes later than yours because urs was going soooooo slow.  So long story short, I'm going with other uploaders now."
,Toomz123,2013-05-13T16:00Z,"Lawls. Darkizzle is totally trolling guys, dont listen to him, Ive read the books. That doesn't happen, what happens is even more surprising, surprisingly enough, hah. "

,Mhen93,2013-05-21T16:23Z,"To everyone saying the torrents are ""being watched"", are you all from the USA? I have never heard of anyone being contacted or ""tagged"" for downloading torrents in Scandinavia. Nor do I think anyone will in the nearest future. "
