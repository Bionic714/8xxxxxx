Check out the NFO-video bitrate @5111kbps is very normal (if not a bit above normal) for these scene 720p BluRay rips.  The movie is only 1hr 37mns, and the audio is 5.1 @640kbps as opposed to the normal DTS 5.1 @1510kbps, so overall, video bitrate and overall bitrate is fine."
,canopener,2013-05-14T03:21Z,^--------- You're right. I judged too quickly by the file size instead of what you have mentioned. Thx for the heads up.
