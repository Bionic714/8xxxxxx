,Bring_Back_Demonoid,2013-05-13T06:28Z,"Hey gameofgroans the writers of the show have changed the story. 

Robb strikes Casterly Rock and seizes it for himself.  The produces of the show want to keep Robb around longer because George Martin fucked up when he wrote the book. "

,BoonesFerry,2013-05-13T08:52Z,"Do some of you not know how torrents work?
8,000 seeders
50,000 leachers
do the math. 
""Slow"" happens with popular shows when tens of thousand of people all jump on a torrent, at the same time, right after it is released. Grow up, do some learning, and stop your sniveling."
,Primexor,2013-05-13T09:03Z,"ALL THEY DO IS TALK ALL EPISODE, AND THEN ESCAPES A BEAR IN A RING AND IT ENDS LOL, Fuck this"
,Drewmeister11,2013-05-13T09:03Z,"Oh, gameofgroans... you seem like you must lead a sad, lonely existence devoid of all happiness, doomed to forever try to spoil the joy that others take in watching a television show to try and recall what it once was to experience human emotion.  And for your own sake, I hope your 12 or younger, because if you're not then you are even sadder than I thought... you poor, sad, lonely individual.  
Fortunately, I've already read the books, so there is no possible way you could spoil it for me.  That doesn't change the wrinkled pit of destitution that must be your soul, however."
,LongshotCRS,2013-05-13T09:08Z,The good stuff!
,m0h1th,2013-05-13T09:16Z,@Primexor LOL
,loving-it2,2013-05-13T09:41Z,hey game of groans - are you just the biggest dickhead in the world or what? Maybe it hasn't occured to you that SOME people haven't read the fucking books and don't know the story? Why the fuck would you come here and post a spoiler you sad wanker? Even if it's true and not just you being a fucking troll? You're supposed to just comment on the quality of the torrent wanker
,xxkevman,2013-05-13T11:25Z,"Why are some downloads 1.4 GiB and others of the same length around 440 MiB?

And both seem to be of the same quality.

Sorry for being such a noob, just curious."

,jjpb,2013-05-14T18:14Z,"Only two channel audio is a dissapointment, esp. when there are 6-ch audio torrents out there.
And BoonesFerry, the scene rules you point to does not apply, they are for SD video.  They also say the container must be MP4, which this clearly is not.
Here are the HD scene rules:

http://scenerules.irc.gs/n.html?id=2011_TV_X264_u2.nfo
though it does not change...
2 channel stereo"
,jjpb,2013-05-15T17:30Z,"""Must be original source audio, AC3 if available."".
Nowhere does it say stereo.  Stereo is not original source audio.

""Minor adjustments to audio (channel count...) ... are permitted.""

So stereo is permitted, not required.  Though I would not consider downmuxing to stereo a ""minor adjustment""."
