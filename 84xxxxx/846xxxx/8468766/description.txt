Johanna D'Arc of Mongolia (1989)
Director: Ulrike Ottinger
Runtime: 165 min

Synopsis: 
A group of cosmopolitan women passengers aboard the Trans-Siberian/Mongolian Railway are taken prisoner by Ulan Iga, a warrior princess. The rigors of the harsh desert landscape in summer test the prisoners' endurance, unlike Princess Ulan and her tribe, who are united with the physical environment by tradition and necessity.
