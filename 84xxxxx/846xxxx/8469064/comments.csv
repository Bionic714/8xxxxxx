patriotism  is a myth. just be loyal to yourself and family and friends. and never to a government. you could not control where you where born. nor should you be controlled on what you stand for. "
,sarabear1,2013-05-14T03:28Z,Do you know that in America guns take more innocent lives then they save?
,Freedomx,2013-05-14T07:33Z,sarabear1 i think you are payed to just spam this. do you work for the government to just try an brainwash the few? the soccer moms? the Obama worshiper? you spammed this on most of the sites dealing with guns...
,Elsereth,2013-05-19T00:55Z,"""in America guns take more innocent lives then they save"" :
That's because these innocent people did not have guns to protect themselves.
If you consider that weapons must be prohibited, then how could the policemen protect people unless they break the law ? 
You can't delegate a right you don't have.
And History shows that gun regulation increases violence."
[H],LemonJ-Lo,2013-05-22T19:25Z,"""This file is here for freedom"".

Bulls**t.  It's there to help criminals arm themselves by avoiding measures designed to keep guns out of their hands.  Why try to buy or steal a gun when you can set up shop and print as many as you and your buddies need?

Wouldn't it be ironic if you were shot and killed by someone who printed this gun?  And none of this BS about ""they'll never get me because I'm armed to the teeth"".  When it's time for your ticket to get punched, it'll get punched.  You're just upping the odds that it will happen sooner than later.

Gonna nominate you for a Darwin award."

Pirated books, movies, and software are one thing.  Can't remember the last time a downloaded pirated video killed someone."
