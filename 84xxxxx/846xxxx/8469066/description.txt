Population Override is the twelfth studio album by Buckethead, but it could be seen as a collaboration with keyboardist Travis Dickerson. The album is a tribute to the "great vinyl records of the '60s and '70s", with songs more often than not drifting off into long jams.

The album was written after the sessions for the album "Brain Circus", by Cornbugs, which features Buckethead, Bill "Choptop" Moseley, Pinchface and Travis Dickerson.
