,LOLicopter,2013-05-14T03:43Z,"""Do you know that in America guns take more innocent lives then they save?""

Does this go for the government's guns as well?  If so, when will you start arguing to disarm the government? "
,sarabear1,2013-05-14T04:06Z,Why not. The whole world would be better of without any weapons.
,Freedomx,2013-05-14T07:01Z,"do you know that more people die without a gun to protect them. this is more then guns kill. 

History tells us if you where not armed you can be easily controlled.

in times like that, you would live by the sword and die by the sword.

This is not a way of keeping us safe. its a way to control us with guns. just the elites will have the guns and you can not. you will be the slave. more taxes and you will begin to love your bondage to life. and not even know you are bonded to working for penny's.

i can kill 20 people with a car. i can kill people with a bomb. i could kill people with a knife sword spear bow crossbow even my hands. i could poison masses without them ever knowing about it. and the thing is. if i was a criminal why would i give up my gun. am i not a criminal?

now saying this. one needs to open there eyes and dont let the fool man fool you any longer. 

Guns do save lives. if you enter a battle without a gun in a gun fight. carrying a knife. you better be dam fast and have good skilled with that knife. having a gun could save you life.

if you want to take away all the guns then you been brainwashed by the media.. yes it would seem better. but then we be left with bows arrows and swords. that kills more people on this earth then guns have never gotten near that much body count. it just cant happen. its like taking alcohol off the streets. you will have your boot Leger to keep supply up. (Gun runners) more cops will die to stop the guns runners. 

thus more people in jail to do slave labor for big corporations. more laws we pass will only help to put people in jail for standing up for there family or friends.

TV news is called Programming. its not that its been programmed by anyone. its been placed in order to watch in a time span. but its been made for you. is why they say now back to your programming. you are the one being programmed. the only reason people accept a King or Queen is because they have been programmed to accept one. you live in a world where the elites want you to be controlled and obey them, and there crafty laws.

Imagine a world where we stop believing in the value of paper money. we stopped saying this person is rich or this one is poor. or he is king and she is queen. stop serving for money or fake loyalty. if everyone just stopped for 1 day and woke up! they could not control us no longer. the house of card would fold in on them. we all wake up from the zombie state and devour our so called owners of our minds. the elites would be nothing to us. we enslave our self in play of there game of control. its a problem reaction solution kind of world we react to. because its our programming. "
,LOLicopter,2013-05-14T07:03Z,"Of course, that's not going to happen, and you know it.  

There are basically three different groups of people to consider in this gun control debate:

1.  Law-abiding citizens

2.  Criminals

3.  Government

With the initiation of gun control laws and bans, the only people who will lose their access to guns are law-abiding citizens.  The criminals and government will still have millions of guns to rape, rob, kidnap, and murder with.

I'll give up my guns, and my individual human right to self-defense, as soon as you can explain to me why only criminals and government should have access to guns.  Because there's not going to be some fantasy world where all guns disappear.  If people like you get what you want, only the guns of a law-abiding citizens will disappear.  

Why should only law-abiding citizens be disarmed?         "
,Freedomx,2013-05-14T07:21Z,"sarabear1 keep drinking the cool-aid. the elites kill more kids in sex trade or for there own evil sex acts on them.

how many people do you know that would want to go and shoot up a school or even a preschool? 

i have never known of anyone. but if you could make it a problem the people will react. more less if you could stage the event and have the media brainwashing the public on how guns are bad. poor children guns bad poor children guns bad over and over again. the people that the brainwashing work on the best will com up with a solution. thus ban all the guns in a slow stage system. that only grows stronger in laws over time. we accept money as is because we learn to value it as children. thus will the next generation with no guns. to be more enslaved to the government as the elites rape there children while they hold a gun to there mother and fathers head.

this is where we are headed if we accept that all guns should be removed from everyone. "
,Freedomx,2013-05-14T07:28Z,"LOLicopter there is only 2 kinds of people

1. Law-abiding citizens
brainwashed to be Law-abiding for some, a lot of stupid laws to enslave us.

2. Criminals, Government
one of the same. cant take them apart. In the end they both have there own undoing. no government has lasted forever. and a criminal my think he got away with a bad thing. but the guy up stairs always remembers or actions."
,LOLicopter,2013-05-14T08:10Z,"Freedomx,

I understand criminals and government are one and the same, but think about who your audience is here.  Most of the people you're trying to convince aren't quite at that stage of understanding yet.  

You don't teach trigonometry to students who haven't yet passed basic mathematics.  "

,samantha941,2013-06-07T02:30Z,"Guns are banned in Chicago and have been for a while but they average close to 2 homicides a day.. Doesnt seem like much i guess but say they go 2 weeks with none then 28 murders in one or two days, it would be a big deal then!!  this is mostly gang related and minority vs minority, so no-one cares....if this happens in a nice neighborhood they want to take away guns,  bleh, come try and take them..take away guns, then only criminals will have guns(incl govt) , You would only create new illegal enterprises, do you know how many shipping containers would come to the usa full of guns if they were banned, lol  kinda like drugs are illegal too"
,Galaxie88,2013-06-12T23:59Z,Guns are fucking stupid. I won't shed a tear when your 3D printed plastic toy blows up in your hand.
