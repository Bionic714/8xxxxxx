Steve Whitaker (1955 ΓÇô February 22, 2008) was a British artist best known as the colourist on the reprint of V for Vendetta. David Lloyd, the artist on V for Vendetta, said Whitaker was not only one of the finest colourists Britain has ever produced, but a great artist, a scholar of the comics medium, and a great teacher, too, who I worked with at The London Cartoon Centre in it's various incarnations.

Following his death, ex-member Tony Keen announced he would organise a one-off memorial mailing, as he had for fellow BAPAn Andy Roberts
