,DeliTide,2013-05-15T11:25Z,"Hehehe. That escalated quickly. No, I am not breaking them up. I just never downloaded them. The collections have all pictures that Doc put in and named just the way I got them originally. I have done nothing to change the files in anyway. 

As to my standards; Yes. Yes, I wish I could fuck them."
,DeliTide,2013-05-15T11:31Z,"And one more thing, trying to find ALL of Doc's collections is probably now impossible. Cheggit had a ton of them and I was in the midst of getting as many as I could. There wasn't even a listing below 400ish so I don't know where those are. I do know that he had well over 1000. If anyone knows where to find them, the info would be great to have."
