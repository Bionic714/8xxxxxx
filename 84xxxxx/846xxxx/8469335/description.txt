Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Erik Hansen, published by Off the Fence in 2010 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

When the oil stopped leaking into the deep sea, BP and the US government declared ┬æmission accomplished┬Æ. Yet BP did not only control the situation, but also the information flow. What really happened within restricted areas? As oil companies are forced to drill deeper and deeper, could this disaster turn into a symbolic and repeating story about the power-play between our thirst for oil, nature and the greed of international corporations
