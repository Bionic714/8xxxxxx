Second-in-rank Byung-doo is a gangster stuck between his overbearing boss and younger criminals, each as aggressive and ambitious as the next and ever ready to take his place. Caring for his siblings and a sick mother, he swings between his real family and his criminal one, the load of each weighing him down until an opportunity arises to change everything.
