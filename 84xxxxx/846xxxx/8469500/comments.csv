if you can take the time to make a torrent then surely to Christ,Allah,Mohammed or whoever you have the time to include a description! Lazy Bollocks!

I've been round torrent practically since they came into being (remember abc on Windose as one of the first easy to use clients)-- been round Mac since 2007 and I have never heard of this app.. That is why a description never goes amiss.

I believe this is quite basic mut might down it and take a look at it all the same,,, so thx at lease for seeding it unlike some fuckers in this joint I could mention... who simply upload a torrent, turn off their machine and fuck off! Wankers!"
