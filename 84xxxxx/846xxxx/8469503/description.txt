A reclusive musician bob dylan), once a huge rock star, takes a young female protegee (fiona). While on a tour she meets a younger, more popular rocker (rupert everett) and switches her loyalties.

i loved the movie when i was young, i was so greatful to find it here again. 

a wonderful movie about being a musician in many facettes.
