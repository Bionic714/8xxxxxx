Castle Crashers is a side-scrolling beat'em up game independently developed by The Behemoth (the same team that made Alien Hominid). Players must hack and slash their way through a cartoony medieval landscape and save the princesses. The game features 4 player co-op over Xbox Live/PSN and locally on one system. Castle Crashers also has RPG elements where you can level up your characters. On top of the 4 knights of the game, there are a slew of unlockable character to be found.
