'Deathbed Testimony' About UFOs Given By Former CIA Official 2013

Published on May 3, 2013

Video testimony by an anonymous alleged former CIA official was shown at the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure at the National Press Club in Washington, DC on Friday, May 3.

UFO author and historian Richard Dolan interviewed "Anonymous" on March 5, 2013. Facing impending kidney failure, this individual felt compelled to disclose secret information he feels is too important to keep secret.

In the video, he claims to have served in the U.S. Army, worked for the CIA, and worked on the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book--one of the USAF's official studies of UFOs. And he refers to the project as "partially a fraud." Asking for clarification, Dolan states, "You're saying some of the Blue Book cases were completely fictitious?" The anonymous man responds, "Yes."

"Anonymous" alleges that, after an invasion threat from President Dwight Eisenhower, he and his superior at the CIA were allowed inside the secretive Area 51 in Nevada to gather intel and report back to the president. There, "Anonymous" describes seeing several alien spacecraft, including the craft that crashed in Roswell, New Mexico. Then, he and his superior were taken to the S-4 facility southwest of Area 51 where they observed live extraterrestrials. (Jason McClellan)
