Windows 8 is quite different than previous Microsoft operating systems, but it's 
still eminently hackable. With this book, you'll learn how to make a variety of 
modifications, from speeding up boot time and disabling the Lock screen to 
hacking native apps and running Windows 8 on a Mac. And that's just the 
beginning. You'll find more than 100 standalone hacks on performance, 
multimedia, networking, the cloud, security, email, hardware, and more. Not only 
will you learn how to use each hack, you'll also discover why it works.
