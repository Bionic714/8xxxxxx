This is the PC98 version of Giten Megami Tensei.
You need an emulator to get it to work (there is one in this torrent).

If you want the Windows version, go there : https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8462730/

Both versions are entirely in Japanese. They are not really different, but I guess  which one you prefer is a matter of opinion.

When I find the graphics to be more enjoyable, the controls aren't really convinient on the PC98 version.
