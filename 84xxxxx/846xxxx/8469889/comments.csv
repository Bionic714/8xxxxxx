So, seeing as how you're awesome and all, do you have Vampire Weekend's new album Modern Vampires Of The City? Thanks in advance!"

It's already up in CD quality here:

Unless you're talking about a vinyl rip.  Which would be very rare for a new release.  I'm uploading the classics in vinyl not new stuff."
