Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy-Casares, Chronicles of Bustos Domecq (E. P. Dutton, 1976).

ISBN: 0525475486 | 143 pages | PDF

Translated by Norman Thomas di Giovanni, this is an odd book: deliberately pompous critical essays by an imaginary author. (H. Bustos Domecq [Honorio Bustos Domecq] was a pseudonym used for several collaborative works by Borges and Adolfo Bioy-Casares.)
