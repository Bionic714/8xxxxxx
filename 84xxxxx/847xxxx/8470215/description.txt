Ancient Cat Society has formed to help balance out the folk/bluegrass/gospel scales. Steered by Buxton front man Sergio Trevino, flanked by bandmates Austin Sepulvado (guitar) and Haley Barnes (keyboards/vocals), the Cat Society with their bare-bones spirituals of faith, doubt and discovery have drawn droves of roots-minded, reverent hipsters to their shows.
