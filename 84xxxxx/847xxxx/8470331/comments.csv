Not that I'm anxious or anything, but there is a crying need for high-quality scans of the work of Thomas Mann, and in particular the more recent translations by John E. Woods.  (Lowe-Porter's work is a little easier to come by but it's been largely discredited.)

Just something to keep in mind should you ever feel inclined to a herculean challenge...
