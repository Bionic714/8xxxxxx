To the campfire of indie-leaning folk returns Fionn Regan. Armed only with the songwriterΓÇÖs principle dietary requirements - acoustic guitar and four-track recorder - and a pathological aversion to the major key, The Bunkhouse Tapes Vol. 1 elegantly captures a vast and melancholy warmth. ItΓÇÖs not without charm, and itΓÇÖs not without earthiness. To regard ReganΓÇÖs work is to enjoy a talent pruned of all pretension. His obsessiveness in this respect borders on paranoia, rhyme schemes glimmering with elemental simplicity, like residual sea salt the waves kicked against the shore.

ReganΓÇÖs fine and underrated catalogue to date signals a complex writer possessing a deft personal touch: so understated yet so muscular, so vital. ItΓÇÖs perhaps no accident that the titular tattoo is, by tradition, the ink of choice for successful transatlantic sailors. Indeed Regan himself, a man given to decorating interviews with flamboyant boating metaphors, here exudes the European serenity of a man who has passed comfortably beyond his bleakest struggles. He has an unswerving composure that can seem frustrating, shy and disingenuous, but also mysterious, exciting and virtuosic.

Before diving into Bunkhouse, it pays well to acclimatise from the precipice. Notice the rippling horizon, the frolicking bass notes, bat away the peripheral fly of impatience. Even when you suspect ReganΓÇÖs raking his own soil, he operates largely in the third person which helps keep our empathy at armΓÇÖs-length. Take ΓÇÖClara to CalaryΓÇÖ, a Leonard Cohen-esque homeland-ballad that smoulders with a distant radiance, like a troubled and intelligent lover who wonΓÇÖt open up: ΓÇ£When his penΓÇÖs on the page, he cheats death, has no age / When his penΓÇÖs off the page, he is old filled with rageΓÇ¥.

Frequently found observing non-specific company, the Regan of Bunkhouse rejects the emotional availability of his previous work; the narrator is neither victim of nor victor over his kingdomΓÇÖs loves and cruelties, but merely a sympathetic witness. On ΓÇÿMizen to MalinΓÇÖ, nature kicks back against human greed as Regan receives sinister prophecies from sources as disparate as sentient gale warnings and the speaking Irish Sea. Like a hastily-acquired tattoo, the albumΓÇÖs emotional restraint is perhaps symbolic of maturity - masculinity, even. But beneath the recordΓÇÖs subconscious topography youΓÇÖre occasionally left grasping for beauty unstained by wisdom: a payoff with the disarming pathos of ΓÇÿPut a Penny in the SlotΓÇÖs ΓÇ£I canΓÇÖt help from cryinΓÇÖ, I wish you were mineΓÇ¥, or of ΓÇÿSow Mare Bitch VixenΓÇÖs wry confession: ΓÇ£IΓÇÖve always had a thing for dangerous women.ΓÇ¥

Not to worry, however - redemption comes in waves. The stomach lurches at one point during ΓÇÿThe BunkhouseΓÇÖ: a line of patience and quiet fervour, delivered with such cool and wizened poise you want to shake its hand and invite it for Sunday dinner: ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre a businessman, wrapped in a kaftan / ItΓÇÖs all youΓÇÖll ever be / Go count your money - IΓÇÖm a painter; youΓÇÖre a framer.ΓÇ¥ Arguably the recordΓÇÖs most impenetrable incident, outlined in ΓÇÿThe GouldingsΓÇÖ, involves a late-night backstreet passenger-seat road trip to some vividly-remembered neighborhood haunt. Something about the journey induces in Regan an epiphany concerning a current relationship so emotionally pummelling (and yet a relationship upon whose strangling grip the narrator is dependent) that itΓÇÖs characterised as a request to be forcibly held underwater. The narrator is thus returned via hallucinatory intervention to a fairytale childhood dreamscape. It is, by any interpretation, a bewitching little number.

Less mannered than Laura Marling and just as reliable as Alisdair Roberts, Regan occupies a cosy and secure seat at the modern folk campfire. As an observer however itΓÇÖs tempting to shoo him away awhile into the redwood forests, just long enough that he might wrestle with something a little meatier, a work as gently heartbreaking as it is cerebrally seductive.
