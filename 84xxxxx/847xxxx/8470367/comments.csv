They mean a great deal to me, and now many others will be able to enjoy their rare wisdom. The impact of your many contributions is inestimable. Thanks so very much."

Now that I'm reunited with my favorite writer I find I'm longing for two of rare books about him made an impression and are very well-regarded. The first is ""The Man in the Sycamore Tree,"" and the other is ""Follow the Ecstasy: The Hermitage Years of Thomas Merton."" I know you may not come across these for some time, if ever, just thought I'd put the word out."

Your Merton obsession knows no bounds!"
