Six volumes of Thomas Merton's Journals:

The Journals of Thomas Merton, Vols. 1-5

and

The Intimate Merton: His Life From His Journals (which is an abridgment of the complete journals)


There are actually 7 volumes of Merton's complete journals, but the first 5 are the ones I have. I think the last two might be the most interesting, so it's too bad I can't find them.

The format for all of them is pdf -- they're good quality, semi-retail.

If you import these books to calibre, it will show you descriptions, series info, etc., for each book.


about the author:

Thomas Merton, O.C.S.O. (January 31, 1915 ΓÇô December 10, 1968), was an Anglo-American Catholic writer and mystic. A Trappist monk of the Abbey of Gethsemani, Kentucky, he was a poet, social activist, and student of comparative religion. In 1949, he was ordained to the priesthood and given the name Father Louis.

Merton wrote more than 70 books, mostly on spirituality, social justice and a quiet pacifism, as well as scores of essays and reviews, including his best-selling autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain (1948), which sent scores of World War II veterans, students, and even teen-agers flocking to monasteries across the US. Merton was a keen proponent of interfaith understanding. He pioneered dialogue with prominent Asian spiritual figures, including the Dalai Lama, the Japanese writer D.T. Suzuki, and the Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh. Merton has also been the subject of several biographies.
