A 4MB piece size is too large for a file of this size and makes it difficult to connect with peers.

Could you please use a 512KB piece size instead when you create the torrent?

Thanks again for the upload!"

I second DaBorgQueen's notion, a smaller piece size would be preferrable, 1MB maybe."
,myoutor,2013-05-19T16:47Z,"YFN - thank you so much for your excellent upload... the quality is just superb given the average size of around 2.3Gish..! do keep it up. after i've seen your S03E07, i checked your other versions from S03E01-06 and found them all excellent! 
so from now on, i'll always be on the lookout for YFN, 1080, 2.xGB.! you're the best..!
pls. keep it up... and thanks once again...
ps.
have you an upload for series 01 & 02? could you share it with us, too? because i haven't seen any YFN with these series.. or maybe i haven't been searching correctly. "
