Alan Yentob concludes the series with a look at the crusading
heroes who seek truth, protect the innocent and do the right
thing - the cops, the cowboys, the doctors and the spooks.

The line separating the hero from the villain has often been
a fine one in American history, and the ambiguities that lie
at the heart of heroism have inspired some of primetime's most
popular and long-running shows, including MASH, The X Files,
24, NYPD Blue and The Wire.

From the white-hat versus black-hat pieties of the 1950s to
the gritty dilemmas of the post 9/11 world, this episode talks
to the stars, creators, writers and producers who have tried
to 'do the right thing' for audiences. There are interviews
with Hugh Laurie (House), Alan Alda (Hawkeye in MASH), Gillian
Anderson (Scully in The X-Files), Dennis Franz (Sipowicz in
NYPD Blue) and Michael K Williams (Omar in The Wire).
