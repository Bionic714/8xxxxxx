,Ultrasone,2013-05-14T00:27Z,"Web rip is a re-encoded 128kbs CBR, which means frequency cutoff is ~16kHz (High Quality pro audio grade Headphones can deliver up to 20~22kHz, loss of hi-fidelity) Proof: http://i.imgur.com/5jYcELS.png Quality is good enough for your iPod, waiting for proper FLAC."

,lfc3333,2013-05-14T22:44Z,DON'T GET SPOTIFY BECAUSE THEY DON'T PAY ANYTHING TO THE ARTISTS

,Pumpsoul,2013-05-15T01:59Z,"All who wants us to buy the album go screw up someone else, we know all about industries, we don't screw nobody if we don't buy the album. If you like it buy it or don't, end of discussion."
,Putor,2013-05-15T04:44Z,"Thank you the upload.... OMG Daft Punk are you, you alive? oh yeah classic!!"
,starrcab,2013-05-15T08:47Z,"I love how people come to tell you what you should or shouldn't do.

By the way how did they come to this page? Searching for it? :D Maybe they just stumbled on it? :)"
,madridqon,2013-05-16T00:28Z,@Krikri3 Itunes is what stuffed up the music industry.
,Verdicat,2013-05-16T11:28Z,"Audio: Good, clear, all intact, but I needed the volume at max and that was just not enough. Quiet. 
Get lucky is the best tune on there by far. 
Slow, chilled out, sleepy, all sounds the same. I wont be buying it, nor keeping this copy. Dissapointed after all the waiting. A flop in my books, but you decide. Regards."
,Psythik,2013-05-16T11:42Z,Fuck iTunes. Why would I want to install that malware garbage on my PC?
,owatatsumi,2013-05-16T18:40Z,"Tracks not labelled well. Don't give any credit to contributing artists. Words not capitalized. Looks rushed and tacky.

Instant Crush (feat. Julian Casablancas)
Lose Yourself to Dance (feat. Pharrell Williams)
Touch (feat. Paul Williams)
Get Lucky (feat. Pharrell Williams)
Fragments of Time (feat. Todd Edwards)
Doin' It Right (feat. Panda Bear)

Where is all of that???"
,nosferatuzeta,2013-05-17T02:11Z,"MUSIC IS FOR SHARING! 
Record companies they missunderstood the concept. They will understand sooner or later
Just think this album is a promo for the concerts to come."
,cws7,2013-05-17T03:25Z,why cant i download from baybrowser for iphone?
,Dr.BIG47,2013-05-17T04:43Z,"@PineappleStarz

,Burgsy,2013-05-18T06:55Z,"Great torrent, yeah. 

But, and i say but, it's just not Daft Punk in my eyes. This album is way to over hyped for what it is.
But each to their own!"
,asotrance,2013-05-18T11:49Z,download it's amazing : http://pirateproxy.net/torrent/8485386/Blackstorm_-_Trance_in_Africa_10_(Special_138)
,yano75,2013-05-19T14:18Z,I don't like this album...  that's disco for Care Bears  -> Recycle Bin
,shawnaldo,2013-05-19T22:04Z,"Not sure how giving my money to Apple by paying for this on iTunes is supposed to help the band. 

If you love a band, go see them in concert. That's where they make their real money. "
,Scott_Tenorman_must_die,2013-05-22T01:18Z,"some bands play for free, give all their music away for free, and only make money from t-shirt sales. check these guys out forg zample:

,BaconFappage,2013-05-27T09:49Z,"Daft Punk has been over-hyped ever since the new tron came out, which they did a great job on btw"
,analogfrog,2013-05-28T14:27Z,"Piracy hurts everyone. Is it stoppable? No. Who would want to? I'm a muso. My shit gets pirated. It hurts my sales. I download pirated stuff. I hurt others. We all hurt each other. Stop feeling bad and instead be a light in this hurtful world. If you've gone one day without food or internet, you know how dark this world can be. Be the light. Smile, be kind, and SHARE. Its a give and take. Wanna hear my music? "
,murder-onez,2013-05-29T18:56Z,Daft Punk has been overhyped since Discovery.. Get real.

,TomK405,2013-06-02T09:45Z,"GARBAGE! Daft Punk 1990?- 2010. RIP.

Dont waste your time like these morons. There new albums suck, go DL the Old ones.. thats actual music.

Or get some TECHNO! better than most commercial garbage people listen to."
,M.CTI,2013-06-04T00:40Z,"Those who say the album sucks... YOU'RE SO MOTHERFUCKING WRONG !!!
Fuck, just listen to it with your shitty concentration on it at 100%, listen to it again, and again if still don't get it !
This is genius ! This is by soo far better than the stuff we can hear today. Tomorrow, or in a decade, everyone will get it, everyone's going to do all like Daft Punk, because they are, and will always be a step ahead."
,Zuccherino,2013-06-05T02:28Z,"Thanks for sharing but honestly nobody should wast its time hearing this shit , RIP real punck"
,loukili4ever,2013-06-06T19:39Z,"great, thank you dude.."
,jakeman77,2013-06-07T07:15Z,"I get the feeling that the people ripping on this album are doing so for the sake of being different. It's too mainstream for them. Great torrent, great album. Good job!"
