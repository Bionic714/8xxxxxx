Show Summary: A crime documentary series. The Killer Speaks, from the creators
of THE FIRST 48, gives the perspective we never hear: the killer. In each
episode, we come face to face with cold-blooded murderers who, for the first
time, let us enter their dark world. They will reveal, in chilling detail, what
they did, how they did it, and why. The Killer Speaks is both a cautionary tale
and a disturbing journey into the mind of a killer.
