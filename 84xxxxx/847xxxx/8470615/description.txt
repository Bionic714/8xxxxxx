Man follows birds is a coming-of-age story of a young uzbek poet surrounded by violence.

Farouk is fascinated by trees and Khamraev films him with a lot of melancholy and tenderness. Cast apart because heΓÇÖs poor and his fatherΓÇÖs drunk, Farouk is not happy in his village. When his father dies, he decides to go in the mountains with his best friends.

Looking for nature at its purest, the two teenage boys have to deal with the cruelty of violent barbarians. Their trip will also make them meet a lost orphan girl and a wise beggar.

Among freezing landscapes, the film is not only a simplistic vision of uzbek poverty. FaroukΓÇÖs dreams, his surreal hallucinations are carried with an enchanting music.

When he talks about this film, Khamraev uses humour and sarcasm: ┬½ One day, a producer came and told me : Tomorrow, you start shooting the film ┬╗ even if there was already a director who started it! ┬╗. Seduced by the story, he did what he was told to and it led to a great film. ΓÇöCamille Lecoq
