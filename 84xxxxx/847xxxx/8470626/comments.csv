,sososo93,2013-05-14T00:29Z,"@kingashi BIG FAIL FOR YOU 

and big thanks to this guy amazing cracked works "
,Raider1500,2013-05-14T00:30Z,"I was able to install it and replace the .dll but every time I try to load the aircraft, FSX crashes. (I'm using windows 7 btw)  Any clues on how to fix it?"
,Sky52,2013-05-14T00:41Z,Awesome ! It works like a charm. Thank you very much Anonymous.  :D
,aveandor,2013-05-14T00:46Z,"SUPER,GREAT,WOOOOOORKS, THANK YOU !!!"
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T00:52Z,"@everyone-Let me explain to those worried about a Trojan. In order to inject a dll, you use an injector to crack the dll file. Yes! A lot of virus software’s are set up to detect the injector and pass along a result of a Trojan. Now I am not saying this does not have one, because you do get dicks out there who do inject a Trojans into their torrents just because they like to mess up peoples computers. However I have not found a Trojan in any FSX addon I have got from TPB. Now I have found some within software torrents, but never in this stuff. I will download this and rip apart the dll file and I will know if it is actually a Trojan or not. I am leaning toward it being a false positive though. "
,Juan86270,2013-05-14T00:56Z,"you are the number one
works thanks"
,Espana25,2013-05-14T01:46Z,what is this just a crack or full aircraft which i doubt an aircraft can't be just 4.69MB unless its a AI plane.
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T01:58Z,Just to put those worried about viruses at ease. I ran through this dll and it is virus free..... :)
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T01:59Z,"@Espana- it is just the cracked dll files. You have to download the main airplane here:

,tuptohs,2013-05-14T02:08Z,"Absolutely great work!  Much thanks, it works like a charm for me, haven't seen any issues yet."
,PAWZinMICH,2013-05-14T02:43Z,Works great. No problems so far. Thanks a bunch.
,zlozla,2013-05-14T03:11Z,"Cant TURN ON TCAS,and cant turn from STBY to TA/RA too ? "
,Airbuspfd,2013-05-14T03:14Z,Great job dzonika! 
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T03:21Z,"Thanks for the cracks! But I have to admit, I am really disappointed with this plane. Their website made this plane out to be all that and if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10. I am sorry to do this, but I gave it a 5. The quality was okay outside of the propellers that were on but not really spinning. The hard engine starting and the poor views. The repaints were the only reason I gave it a 5 or it would have been less. But the plane and crack was a great share to test out, so thank you. I certainly would not invest money into this plane. "
,zlozla,2013-05-14T03:36Z,srry TCAS working.just hold for 3 sec...
,kingashi,2013-05-14T06:10Z,sry for the bad words i thought its fake....but i take my non sense back..and much thanks..

,KuSH-420,2013-05-14T08:08Z,How hard is it to crack software like this and crack DLLs? I would like to learn how but don't know where to start. If anyone has any tips or maybe guides to read I would love to learn and be able to serve the community like others do!
,sososo93,2013-05-14T14:09Z,"@kingashi     the best BIG fail of the year for you dude,the next time test it after says that a BIG shit lool"

,nishal1425,2013-05-14T22:03Z,"For some reason i cant download, it just says connecting too peers, anyone else has this PROBLEM?"
,maddog7777,2013-05-14T22:12Z,"@KuSH-420- It is more tedious to crack dll files because you have to edit them and inject most of them. I use hex editor myself and I use the extreme injector v2.1 by master131 to do my dll's. It can be very time consuming if you do not know what your doing. But there are a lot of pages on the web that show you how to do certain dll files. Once you get the hang of it, you can do it. "
,boeinglover73,2013-05-14T22:15Z,"@dzonika did you crack it yourself? If yes, can you tell us how did you do this and if it was hard?"
,_anon500_,2013-05-14T22:21Z,something is wrong with the patch.. when you select it in the menu it suddenly starts to make sounds lol.
,mgaiff,2013-05-14T23:01Z,"Hey Guys, I'm also getting stuck with [Connecting to Peers] If anyone has the file can I ask PLEASE if you could email it to me. Thank You Guys in advance . email. mgaiff@hotmail.com"
,Espana25,2013-05-15T01:50Z,@maddog7777 -Thanks a lot buddy appreciated your feedback as always :) have a good one and im gonna give this thing a try for sure !
,roume666,2013-05-15T04:20Z,"For some reason when I load this plane it goes  crazy after a while. It bounces all over the place. Let me know if anyone else having this problem. And if yes, Does any one know how to fix it...? "
,turontado117,2013-05-15T05:42Z,IT WORKS!  my next problem is how to operate this aicraft
,Espana25,2013-05-15T05:47Z,OK so it works amazing!!! apart from the fact that some people might won't get to turn on the TCAS but it works i read somewhere around here explaining it to hold for 3 sec's and then it starts well other than that aircraft works great and it has no issues with controls or anything everything is very much interactive and there are many ways you can interact with this aircraft it has all the available options in the flight deck over all great product great interaction pretty much every thing is clickable in the cockpit nothing is there without a reason everything responds with the aircraft ...this is definitely a masterpiece product to get definitely worth buying i would now recommend everyone to buy this and have fun with it and show respect to the developers.
,savioli,2013-05-15T10:12Z,hi...it dosn't work for me no landing gear an no gauges all the panel is black please i need help i love this aircraft thx

I am half way through, but I need a bit of help.

But, Kaptain's method cut the connection after passing other antiDBGs..."
