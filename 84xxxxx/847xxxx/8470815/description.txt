Polar Bears are born to deal with snow, ice and cold
but as a result of climate change, they are forced to
adapt to longer summer conditions

This is the white bear like youâ™ve never seen it before.
Underwater cinematography, helicopter cameras and
radio-controlled truck cams follow the polar bear everywhere
he goes. And - for the first time ever - polar bear
collar-cams take you into the bearsâ™ secret world.

This is the story of a young bear's epic migration through
the icy waters of Hudson Bay. Watch his desperate acts as
he is pushed to the brink. Witness the wisdom and commitment
of a protective mother bear. Observe the seemingly ferocious
social rituals of massive male bears. ICE BEAR features
breath-taking cinematography shot over twelve months,
capturing rarely seen bear behavior.
