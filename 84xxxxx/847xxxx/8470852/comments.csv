[V],wushdishmeen,2013-05-14T11:11Z,"Too many are hitting and running obviously.  I'm seeding it again now so would hope you guys seeding right now can keep it going for a bit.

It had nearly 200 seeders when I dropped off.  I have to drop off at that point since I have an entire network to run with other content to upload.  But I do these torrents for people who haven't joined yet.

So I beg you guys please seed for at least an hour or so after you finish downloading.  Leave it seeding when you leave for work or go to sleep!

I get certain people have bandwidth limitations and stuff.  But please try to help so others can enjoy the show too.  Thanks."
