Random Access Memories pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 80s era of music in the United States, particularly the sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders.
