In postwar France, 16-year old misfit Hannah lives in the Paris suburbs with her garage-mechanic father, doting mother and two svelte sisters. Hannah's way smarter than any other member of her affectionate but stifling family. She also senses she destined for bigger things, but sees no sure-fire escape from her ugly-duckling niche.
