once more 1000 thanks for re-seeding of Muse and Frida videos. I'll serve these for a couple of time and re-seed them systematical for the other leechers.

Two videos from last lists are not finished yet:
* Muse - Bliss (Live Reading 2006).avi
* Frida - Baby Don't You Cry No More (Live Show-Express 1982).avi

At my dl some more of your 'old babies' still are incomplete:
* Agnetha Fältskog - Can't Shake Loose (Live The Heat Is On Special 1983).avi  (3.4 MB missing)
* Agnetha Fältskog - I Wish Tonight Could Last Forever (Live The Heat Is On Special 1983).avi  (7 MB missing)
* Agnetha Fältskog - Mr Persuasion (Live The Heat Is On Special 1983).avi  (6 MB missing)
* Agnetha Fältskog - Shame (Live The Heat Is On Special 1983).avi  (5.12 MB missing)
