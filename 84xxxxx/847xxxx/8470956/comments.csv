,Glocc5000,2013-05-15T04:38Z,can u make it where u can play this on the ps3 it shows up as corrupted
,chewslab,2013-05-16T20:11Z,"hey Glocc5000. don't use a PS3 to watch downloaded content. it shows up as corrupt because Sony is useless for this stuff. the PS3 will only play a few selected codecs and even then, if you are online when watching them Sony can detect copy-written files and deactivate the sound. for $75 you can buy a WDTV media box that will play any file you throw at it. "

I see some misinformation is starting to spread... that shit spreads fast on the internet!

@ chewslab - Absolutely wrong. I believe what you're trying to describe is ""Cinavia"". It's an audio watermark on some bluray disks which isn't/can't be removed during the ripping process. This is what causes the audio to quit after a few minutes of playing that 720p or xvid BDrip. This is common for many bluray players. The work around is either use X360 or get a cheap laptop with HDMI output to plug into the TV and play from that.

The PS3 does NOT scan the media it plays while the console is connected to the internet. That's just silly. Next-gen consoles, tho', yeah, maybe. We'll see.

@ Glocc5000 - It's not that CRiMSON doesn't know how to ""code"" (encode) it for a PS3, they just don't know how to do River Monsters. The last 3 releases of this show from CRiM I think were eventually nuked for bad ivtc. After looking at this video frame by frame, yeah, it could be nuked as well."
