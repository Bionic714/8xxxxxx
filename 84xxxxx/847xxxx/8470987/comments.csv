@Brownsugar13:

Okay thanks for this unrated movie.

A: 10/10
V: 10/10

waiting for Sman 1,2,3 movies.

Question: Why don't you increase your video bit rate (1697 kbps to 2000 kbps)? If you made more than 2000 kbps that will be great quality in video. Your Audio quality is fine and awesome; you are maintaining good bit rates for DD 5.1 audio i.e 6 channels. Thanks for that too. And why don't you stick with only one English subtitle, Dutch subtitle I think no one uses it. I use only English subtitle and we use it all time with English audio..."

i agree on the bitrate part!!!! Although his encodes still look flawless (not to mention he is one of my fav uploader)!!!its just that when you watch these movies on a larger screen,then the bitrate comes into play....
but i don't have anything against him uploading whatever subtitles he prefers,maybe most of his fans are from netherlands....we can always uncheck it from utorrent!!! no problems there... :)"

@dalesteyn:

I agree with u Well said by my friend. So when we are downloading brown movies, we can uncheck Dutch subtitle and other subs from utorrent downloading. so it can automatically add only an English sub srt to MKV file or MP4 file. So I can play and watch brown movies on a big t.v screen."
