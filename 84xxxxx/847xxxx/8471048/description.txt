This is Immortal Throne expansion pack only.  The original game, Titan Quest, is not in this torrent.

Titan Quest is based on the end of communication between the gods and humanity. The main character (whose name and sex can be chosen by the player) begins the quest on a dirt road near a small village named Helos. The world has been overrun by beasts and creatures (drawn largely from mythology) that are terrorizing the countryside wrecking harvests, burning temples, invading villages and cemeteries, besieging cities etc. After being sent on a mission to Delphi by the Spartan general Leonidas, the story revolves around the fictional order of Prometheus and their efforts to restore balance to the world. The hero finds centaurs, harpies, automatons, spiders and scorpions, yetis, undead soldiers and other such monsters derived from myth, relentlessly guarding the way and trying to prevent him from reaching the next village or town. The hero must occasionally face stronger 'miniboss' monsters, usually as part of a side quest. Bosses also appear at intervals generally guarding a main quest item, transportation device, quest NPC etc. The player faces a boss enemy (called telkines) at the end of each 'act' (Greece, Egypt and The Orient) and faces a final boss enemy at Mount Olympus, the Titan Typhon.

THQ released Titan Quest: Immortal Throne as an expansion pack in March 2007. It features the continuation of the story. Zeus sends the character to the underworld, where he must battle Hades, the Greek god of the dead.

Along with the expansion many fans started to create modifications to improve game which are downloaded and installed off websites. They often use basic programs to modify the difficulty or add skills and items, although there are also full conversion quests, most notable of which is the "Lilith" mod [4] which effectively adds a new game in the form of a new world to explore with 150 hours worth of new game play as well as new gameplay elements.
