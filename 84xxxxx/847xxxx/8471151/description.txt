Journeyman Project 3 is a worthy installment of the franchise. A fascinating story, memorable characters, and puzzles that are both fun and intuitive are only the tip of an iceberg of what this game has to offer. The third installment features gameplay improvements like a first person perspective view, and the new "Chameleon Jumpsuit" that lets you interact with characters form the past. Also, Jerry Rector does an excellent job playing Gage Blackwood. When compared to the previous installments, this one is everything they were and more. If you are a fan of the series than this is a no-brainer. If you havenΓÇÖt heard of those games before then this is a good place to start, even though this is the third part, because the story exists independently from the previous ones, and the production values and gameplay are top of their class.
