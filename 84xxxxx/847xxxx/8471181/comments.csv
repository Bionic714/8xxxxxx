Sorry, 2010kaiser, EZTV does not use an invite syste. New member signup was disabled some time ago due to spam bots that were creating huge numbers of account and posting a ton of spam. The EZTV admin is working on a site redesign and I suspect that new member sign ups will be re-enabled....or at a later date...but they will be open again eventually. Currently, anyone can view all pages on the site and anyone can download torrents. What they cant do is write to the forums or setup a personalized show watch page.
