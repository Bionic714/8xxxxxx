This song always bothered me.  It is dirty just to be dirty.  It's like they are saying, "Haha, look at us.  We're being dirty!"  Seems very immature.  I am not a prude, this just seems to be dirty for no reason.

But then the problem.  I like the song.  It has a great melody and is recorded well.  So I created this "clean" version so I can enjoy this song without cringing.
