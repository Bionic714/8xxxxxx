Woody has a Health Plan... set up beautiful women as nurses to take care of rich but ailing old men. Make sure the senior citizen falls in love with his "Special Treatment"... set up the wedding... and soon after, the gold digging nurse and Woody are the only beneficiaries of the poor guys fortune. A fool-proof scheme one might say... but someone is hot on their trail and it ain't the Health Department.
