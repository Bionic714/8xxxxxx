Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: The Monday, May 13 edition of The Alex Jones Show is a jam-packed Bilderberg exclusive with Prison Planet.com editor Paul Joseph Watson reporting his latest findings and revelations following his trip to The Grove Hotel situated in Watford, Hertfordshire, UK. Paul relays key intel regarding the globalist confab's merger with Google, the ultimate Big Brother that makes George OrwellΓÇÖs 1984 look like a childrenΓÇÖs fairy tale. 

On today's transmission, Alex welcomes digital privacy advocate and talk radio host Dr. Katherine Albrecht to explain Google's eerie role in erecting a massive spy network against the people. 

Alex also invites comedian, actor and author of Hit List, Richard Belzer to examine the government's latest staged events, the Benghazi debacle and why another false flag terror event is likely in store for the near future.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
