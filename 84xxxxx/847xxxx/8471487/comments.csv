,jkjk0001,2013-05-14T06:39Z,is it really a CD source? Stream rip or real deal?
,berryhill,2013-05-14T12:22Z,"This is a proper CD rip, I could tell by a long mile on the sound quality comparing the iTunes stream and this release. 

Thanks!"
,Near86,2013-05-14T14:04Z,Muchas gracias :D
,xLeone,2013-05-14T14:52Z,Thanx!
,alejandro70pb,2013-05-15T01:23Z,GRACIAS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Dragonbird21,2013-05-15T05:02Z,@berryhill - Really? The iTunes stream was already 256kbps AAC which is already very good quality (and some argue 256kbps AAC is better than 320kbps mp3)
,hashnew,2013-05-15T05:39Z,Thanks so much!
,chem_101,2013-05-16T10:43Z,THANK YOU!  AMAZING

,slvrpg,2013-05-22T06:21Z,I was seriously going to actually buy this. I only buy off of iTunes gift cards. I have $11.50 credit from a gift card. Album if $11.99...Fucking serious? Stealing this shit. Remember when real CDs were $10?
,Beetlejuicexx,2013-05-24T00:21Z,"@asotrance why? It's not even split tracks, fool.
