Sam MacHorne and her Devil Dogs need a contract, and when one comes in that leads to the haunted Wythmoor Forest, the company moves out with warjacks and slug guns at the ready...

Sam and the Devil Dogs may be relaxing in Tarna, but itΓÇÖs not by choiceΓÇötheyΓÇÖd rather be employed. When a dangerous job offer comes from the old man, Sam takes the Devil Dogs and their newest recruit, Dawson, on a perilous hunt to capture an unidentified warjack before their rival Steelheads or the horrific Cryx make a claim on the never-before-seen technology. 

Whether their mission will be worth the risk remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Sam and the Devil Dogs will do whatever it takes to bring home The DevilΓÇÖs Pay.
