Designed to be "the platformer to end all platformers" from the design team at Pwnee Studios, Cloudberry Kingdom is an innovative and endlessly challenging platformer that adapts to your skill level. Thanks to a dynamic AI system designed around the creator's study of platforming games -- flow, spacing, rhythm, player expectation -- Cloudberry can provide a very simple and enjoyable platforming experience for inexperienced players or can ratchet up the challenge to insane (but always beatable) levels of hair-raising, face-melting difficulty. 
Cool bonus features such as ghost data tracking (for improving your skills by watching previous play-throughs,) level sharing (to lend your favorite generated stages to others to try and beat,) leaderboards (for comparing your progress against others,) and freeplay design (for customizing details such as number of fireballs, speed & height of obstacles, etc., all exchangeable with others once you've found a stage that fits your idea of perfection) make this endless game eternally addicting. 
NOTE: This game has been officially announced as a title in production but has not yet been confirmed for release on any specific platform. It may or may not be released on this system. Please check back for official info.
