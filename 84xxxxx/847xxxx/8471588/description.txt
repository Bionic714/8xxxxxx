Sanctum 2 provides a mix of intense action and strategic gameplay that combines thrilling multiplayer and stunning graphics, raising the bar for indie games. Melding the best elements of the tower defense and first-person shooter genres, players are challenged to protect oxygen-producing Cores from hordes of deadly aliens who are threatened by their existence. 
Outfit your character exactly the way you want through the new and extensive customization system. Choose your own loadout of towers, weapons and perks, but choose wisely because you are humanityΓÇÖs last defense against the unrelenting hordes set out to destroy it. In Sanctum 2, you will utilize elements from multiple gameplay genres to succeed. Construct towers and walls during the building phase before the enemies attack, then jump into the fray and blast everything to pieces in FPS mode. You can progress through the single-player campaign yourself, or play with up to four friends in co-op to discover the secrets of the planet LOEK III and learn the backstory on why the aliens are so intent on destroying the Cores you are sworn to protect.
