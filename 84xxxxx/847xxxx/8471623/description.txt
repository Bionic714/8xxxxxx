Description:
Remove your head, grab some bombs, and step into the boots of Serious SamΓÇÖs most iconic foe, the Headless Kamikaze. Dodge hazards and heavy ordinance from the cowardly Serious Sam himself as you make your way through the chaotic action in an attempt to do what you do best: blow up the vile Serious Sam.

Features:

Kamikaze Action ΓÇô Direct your kamikaze horde toward certain death in more than 40 levels of mobile action. Either fall at the hands of Serious SamΓÇÖs bombs and rockets or go out in an honorable blaze of glory in the service of Lord Mental.

Super Sleek Art ΓÇô Colorful hand-drawn artwork distracts you from the underlying truth: your little kamikaze friend is destined to die in a horribly violent explosion. Cartoon dismemberment has never been so pretty.

Savage Bonus Modes ΓÇô Take a shot at kamikaze immortality by posting a top score on one of the endless bonus levels like Complete Chaos and Frog Punt.
