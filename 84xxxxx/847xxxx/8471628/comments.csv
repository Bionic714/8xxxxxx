I used Alcohol 120% to mount iso file, started setup.exe and got message to insert disc 1 to continue installation. Then I copied all files from virtual drive to new folder, renamed setup-1.bin to install-1.bin, setup-2.bin to install-2.bin, and so on... When I started setup.exe, and got the same massage, but I redirected it to my new folder containing .bin files, and setup contiuned as normally. I think I'll stick with Razor 1911's version of the game, couse it just works."
