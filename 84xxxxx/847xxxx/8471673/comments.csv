,orfix,2013-05-14T21:25Z,"That was a fast download :D

AUDIO: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, floatle, 320.0 kbit/11.34% (ratio: 40004->352800)"
,zhekazlo,2013-05-15T00:35Z,"Fucking garbage upload, no is3tags, broken files. "
,rasp88,2013-05-15T00:39Z,Could you upload the .wave files as well?
,e(c),2013-05-15T01:06Z,Sorry but this rip is awful... Very distorted.
,AJcrash,2013-05-15T01:37Z,"Thanks, doesn't sound distorted at all to me.  I didn't play it at max volume though.

Since you have the lossless .wav format, could you upload that also. Personally I'd prefer it over 320 mp3's.

Again thanks for your effort."
,MSM56,2013-05-15T02:33Z,"@AJcrash : maybe I'll upload it, since its a rip from a stream I don't know if it worth it

@ complainers : This torrent was made to wait for a rip from a cd, sorry if you think the sound is shitty (I'm a visual pro and a noob about audio). I made this rip for myself then I shared it, I don't pretend anything."
,AJcrash,2013-05-15T06:03Z,"@MSM56: No worries, this will hold me over until a proper FLAC version hits.

All the folks complaining, it's 13 files, even if the tags need a little un-fucking, it's free and early. Spend the 5-10 minutes and tag them proper! It's not hard. I've got much worse in the past, but I fixed it all up, added HQ art and saved a boatload of $$."
,NcrSkeith,2013-05-18T04:31Z,"Will buy the album for sure, have been always and will be a great fan and supporter of Daft Punk.

DAFT PUNK ALL THE WAY."
[T],reactor90,2013-06-04T16:06Z,"This album is bangin so far, screw all the haters, go back and listen to Herbie Hancock and realize the influence he had on electronica. "
