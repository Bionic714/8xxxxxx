[V],HeroMaster,2013-05-14T04:47Z,"@Kneph Update Directx and you need to install ""vcredist_x86.exe"" in ""_redist"" FOLDER then run ""Pinball FX2.exe"", then the game would work fine."

,Maou-JP,2013-05-14T16:38Z,Thanks!
,dilinwe,2013-05-14T16:49Z,cant save in the game.
,russianhornybear,2013-05-15T02:47Z,"not working on Win 8, i have all visual crap installed(2005-2010) and DX11+9 ...
missing C++ file kinda fake info its not missing.
compatibility and admin modes cant do a shit also.
perhaps not possible to play it on win8 because we already have it from Store ?:P"
,dilinwe,2013-05-15T04:50Z,how can increase the quality graphics-=
,moey1974,2013-05-15T04:55Z,"Working fine win8 Pro 64bit, make sure to run Pinball FX2.exe (as administrator) right click and select (Run As Administrator) on the Pinball FX2.exe icon, or right click on Pinball FX2.exe and select properties and you can select to always run as Adminstrator so you do not have to right click, also install vcredist_x86.exe in the  (_redist) folder. 

NOTE: Cannot end game while playing so In-Game saves NOT WORKING when trying to end a game but simply tilt the table while playing a game to end the game, its a simple enough solution until a real fix comes out.

Props to the uploader, thx bro"
[V],-wxm-,2013-05-15T04:58Z,O_O My god I hope my PC is good enough to run this
,moey1974,2013-05-15T05:02Z,"PS: This Pinball FX2 release does save your scores after you finished playing a table and you input your initials. On main screen where you select your tables you can press (Local Highscores) on the right side and you can see that it does save your high scores and initials..so it works fine but like my reply above...while playing if you try and stop the game it hangs while its trying to save..so to get around this..just ""tilt"" the table while playing and it'll end the game than it allows you to go back to main screen to play a different table..simple enough until a fix comes out to fix this glitch..but still the game works great as it is now..star wars tables are kick butt!!"
,moey1974,2013-05-15T05:07Z,"dilinwe - Go to bottom left corner of main screen and select "" Options/Help"" then go into settings and at the top left you will see (audio), (video), (graphics)...something like that, can't quite remember the exact options but you will see (Graphics) select that and it allows you to change resolution and AA (anti aliasing) up to x8 MSAA..slim settings but still the game looks nice with x8MSAA and 1920x1080.

The game works with xbox 360 usb game pad on PC..that is what i am using..i press red button to save graphic settings..not sure what it is on keyboard"
,Beelzy,2013-05-15T12:56Z,"Game playing way too fast here for some reason. Unplayable :/

Thanks though!"
,edmorte,2013-05-15T17:51Z,"I made all the repair recomendation that you guys wrote but im getting this message: the procedure entry point _crtcreatesymboliclinkW could not be located in the dynamic link library msvcr110.dll

So, any idea how to solve this?"
,kaskote,2013-05-15T17:55Z,"first of all , thank you very much for the upload, i love pinball games.
Secondly , for those of you that the game plays too fast i found out that enable ""Vertical Sync"" slows down the game, thing is , now is a bit slow , i thing cause of the hz of the screen resolution , 60 hz bit slow , i think 75 hz would be fine.
lastly , if you want to exit a table in the middle of the game you can Esc the game , ""Restart game"" in menu then ""exit to main menu"".
hope it helps."
,moey1974,2013-05-15T18:57Z,"kaskote

Yeah...i just figured that out myself about stopping in a middle of a game to get back to the main menu. I had originally replied back yesterday about just ""tilting"" the table when playing to end the game but...restarting the game while playing the game then you can go back to main menu is a lot quicker then ""tilting"" the table to end the game. 

regards"
