,xsaeros,2013-05-14T04:26Z,I'm pretty sure we're at Episode 5.. Is this a pre-release or has everyone simply overlooked the typo?
,ModerFukr,2013-05-14T04:34Z,"There are 4 defiance episodes available on TPB, episode 1 & 2 were aired back to back and are available as 1 upload.... the second upload should have been identified as S01E03 but was uploaded as S01E02.. that's where the mistake comes from.. we're at episode 5 according to IMDB "
,TJ_MO,2013-05-14T04:43Z,size looks close to a full episode. only shy by 40MiB. its definitely too big for a 4 min pre-clip. my quess is typo
,sevilalucard,2013-05-14T04:43Z,its a typo
,novastar17,2013-05-15T08:08Z,"I think this is actually episode 6 not 5
there is a gap between what 4 is supposed to be and what this is. there is footage in the previews not shown in the '4' which is what i have last seen.
downloading a different five now to see"
,novastar17,2013-05-15T08:10Z,FUCK I SOMEHOW MISSED AN ENTIRE EPISODE IGNORE MY LAST
