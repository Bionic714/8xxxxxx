,markall44,2013-05-14T04:50Z,This is actually episode 5...
,BoonesFerry,2013-05-14T09:01Z,"Thank you, markall44.

""Defiance S01E06 HDTV x264-2HD"" was mislabeled/titled. 
It should have been titled S01E05.

I suspecte that 2HD will issue a dir-fix at the Scene level?, but 
since we already have the episode, and we don't change names
of files that are already in circulation (that just causes even more
confusion), we will just have to live with it. I doubt that we will release 
a second torrent with the correct number...but it could happen.


Per scene rules, next week's episode would be titled:
""Defiance S01E06 REAL HDTV x264""

,ernesthart,2013-05-15T04:23Z,"Everyone probably got confused and titled them as Episode 6 because the IMDB completely fucked it up. Hope it clears things up when you search for Defiance S01E06 when it actually comes out, and you end up here instead and download finding out you just watched it last week......"
,B0b_D0le,2013-05-18T06:14Z,So by downloading this I'll end up with a 3rd copy of episode 5?  Awesome.  :)
,Imehiel,2013-05-18T12:49Z,This is episode 5. Let others know.
,KrazyKrl,2013-05-18T14:33Z,"NOTE: This is episode 6, It's properly labeled.

Episodes 1 & 2 were aired together as a double.

IMDB is correct. The scene mislabeled the Pilot to not include Episodes 1 and 2 in the name."
,Imehiel,2013-05-19T18:56Z,I'll put it other way. Current episodes 5 and 6 are identical copies.
,B0b_D0le,2013-05-24T02:26Z,"If what you're calling Episode 1 and 2, aired together, back to back, then it's a single double length episode.

Each new DATE that something airs is an episode, not each half hour block.  It needs to be this way so people can look at the episode # they have and determine the next # by airing date.

... Just A Suggestion, the other way obviously doesn't work well."
,dragonFyr,2013-05-24T22:30Z,Really? So where is the next damn episode...
,dragonFyr,2013-05-24T22:37Z,So where is the next epsiode then?
,Jamez80,2013-05-25T03:15Z,Any ETA on episode 7?
,cougarx1,2013-05-26T15:38Z,"This is BS, but what is worse is it's on free Hulu!  That is pretty cool, but I still need the correct copy for Plex."
,gothash,2013-05-28T02:44Z,can you please upload episode 7?
