,phoeniks314,2013-05-16T00:07Z,"Disc not supported. WTF. I'm on lt2.0 injected topology, truncuate...any solutions."
,gameboy77,2013-05-16T01:11Z,"using abgx i get a message to use auto fix 3, but then i get a message....
""Error: Failed to reopen (my file name) for writing.  AutoFix Failed, Stealth is still unverified""

any idea how to fix this issue?"
,gameboy77,2013-05-16T01:18Z,"ok never mind i  made it my bitch and made it work lol. in case others have issue, i tried this.

I deleted the disk image file, and ran the autofix level 3 first. it created the new disk image and did all the cks and patches and worked for me.

hope this helps others. Happy gaming."
,Smallz94,2013-05-16T05:23Z,Great game i say. Burned it well with agbx360 which you dont really need it to play online THANKS!
,vinnievic86,2013-05-17T00:16Z,Thanks for the up but whats with the rar files?? Is this 1995?? Errors all over the place... Just post the ISO.
,ClipperCigars,2013-05-17T00:30Z,"@ _whoa_, you still refuse to get it?

Yes, it is the iMARS release, it's just extracted already. Abgx360 VERIFIES this FACT! This shit has been explained to you REPEATEDLY in the past.

Multi-part archives are for usenet because of message size limits. Torrent people as a general rule don't like or want that because it's unnecessary. Don't even bother thinking about filesharing website where extraced iso's are typically repacked into 200meg multi-part archives because that will really just annoy the shit out of you.

That you're a troll (or more than likely just plain stupid) and refuse to understand the accepted netiquette of different transmission methods is your own problem, not something for you to ""warn"", I'm sorry, I mean ""ANNOY"" others about. 

So kindly quit spamming your ignorant bullshit in every xbox360 torrent just because it's not presented according to how you think it should be."

If you have problems, just buy the fucking game, you're clearly a cheap motherfucker, complaining over two discs, which cost what, $2 each? Grow up and stop being a little cunt."

,hamiator,2013-06-02T07:14Z,"I too was having issues with abgx360 verifying the DMI.  It kept saying it wasn't able to reopen the file. 

What I did to fix it:
Disable the ""read-only"" option in the file properties of the ISO file. After this, re-run abgx360 (I did AutoFix 3) - and presto!  I'm about to burn it now."
,audioicon,2013-06-05T22:44Z,"Verified through ABGX360. All green, DMI was fixed and verified. Thank you HeroMaster!, iMars!"
