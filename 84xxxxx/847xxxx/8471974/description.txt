Legend of Drizzt - Neverwinter Saga Books 1-4


Book 1 Gauntlgrym

Book 2 Neverwinter

Book 3 Charon's Claw

Book 4 The Last Threshold


All four books in one torrent!

This is my first time creating a torrent so please excuse any mistakes.

I found Book 3 and 4 on Pirate Bay but wasn't able to find Book 1 or 2.  Luckily I found that Audible.com was giving a free trial for 2 audiobooks, so I decided to download them and share them here.

Book 1 I encoded by ripping the audiobook to CD with Nero 7 and then converting back to MP3 with CDex.  The quality is good but it is broken into many smaller files. I renamed the files to shorten the path length.

Book 2 I encoded using Audials, so there is just one MP3 for Part 1 and Part 2, though the quality is slightly worse than the CD rips.

Books 3 and 4 I obtained from torrents on Pirate Bay and they are included to give downloaders the complete Neverwinter Saga.

Enjoy!


*Note* I tried uploading this before but there were issues with the file paths being too long.  This should now be fixed since I renamed all the Gauntlgrym files to be much shorter.
