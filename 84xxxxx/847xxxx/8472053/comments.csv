Yes, it is the iMARS release, it's just extracted already. Abgx360 VERIFIES this FACT! This shit has been explained to you REPEATEDLY in the past.

Multi-part archives are for usenet because of message size limits. Torrent people as a general rule don't like or want that because it's unnecessary. Don't even bother thinking about filesharing website where extraced iso's are typically repacked into 200meg multi-part archives because that will really just annoy the shit out of you.

That you're a troll (or more than likely just plain stupid) and refuse to understand the accepted netiquette of different transmission methods is your own problem, not something for you to ""warn"", I'm sorry, I mean ""ANNOY"" others about. 

So kindly quit spamming your ignorant bullshit in every xbox360 torrent just because it's not presented according to how you think it should be."
