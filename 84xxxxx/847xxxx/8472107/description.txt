Ranger Mode: 2 Extra difficulties.
Ranger Realistic. A more ΓÇ£realisticΓÇ¥ difficulty, but not necessarily harder if you keep your eyes open. A stray bullet or two can kill Artyom, but it works both ways as all player weapons do roughly three times the damage they usually dish out. Ammo pickups usually contain one to five bullets. The HUD has crosshairs disabled.
Ranger Hardcore:
An ultimate challenge for the player. The HUD is disabled completely save for laser pointers on mid to late-game weapons. Both Artyom and his enemies are ΓÇ£glass cannonsΓÇ¥, killing and dying incredibly fast, up to the point of one hit ΓÇô one kill. Stealth is advised, since the run-and-gun approach is severely limited by low ammo pickups ranging from one to two bullets in a batch.
