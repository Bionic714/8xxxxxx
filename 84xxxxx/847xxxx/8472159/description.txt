Slow the Rain is the debut album by indie pop singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson. It was self released on January 10, 2005. It is mostly piano based except for guitar accompanied "A Bird's Song" and the surprisingly divergent finale "I'll See You in My Dreams" which is reminiscent of one of Sam Brown's ukulele songs, "I'll Be Here". The album is filled with driving rhythm, lively and pulsing bass lines, melodious vocals, and beautiful harmonies. All of it executed with Ingrid's consistent vivacity.
