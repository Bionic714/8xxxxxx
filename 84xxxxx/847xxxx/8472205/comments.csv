[T],SCSA420,2013-05-14T23:31Z,Unfortunetely my CW network channel was having technical difficulties on DirecTv Saturday morning and because of the problem there was NO CW network feed on so I couldn't capture it since there was an interruption of the CW network signal. Funny thing is I believe that I was the only one actually capturing the Saturday Morning Slam show and others were taking my releases and re-encoding them and putting there group name on it and uploading it elsewhere because NO other group has released a WWE Saturday Morning Slam 2013-05-11 show anywhere on the internet. I know because I've looked almost everywhere including secret places on the internet I won't even mention and there isn't one anywhere to be found. If there is then prove me wrong and tell me where it is otherwise I don't believe it.
