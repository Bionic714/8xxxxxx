any ways to fix this ? "
,Wick08,2013-05-14T17:25Z,"Okay!

For you that have problem with at black screen and problems with the menus are cut off. Here is the solution.

Click on metroLL benchmark, there you can change your resolution and also other settings. I did that and also run a benchmark test and after that I could play the game without any problems!

You can also choose between DX11 and DX10, I tested to run the game with DX11 and is was laggy as hell, so run the game with DX10.


Hope that helps!

,ntongh2o,2013-05-14T18:10Z,"Guide to installing more clearly.

1. Run setup.exe and choose the third option (you can install anywhere even though the default is the steam folder)

2. Copy over the NoDVD folder contents of the metroll.exe and steamapi.dll and steamrld

3. Run game (worked first time for me launched with no issues)

4. The game menu is in RUSSIAN, so to change to english go the the right most option in the main menu. The choose the second option, then you'll see some checkboxes and options that let you choose left and right, the first one of those is the language and just keep choosing till you hit english.

5. Enjoy and don't forget to download the latest drivers for your video card."

,Kona_Guy,2013-05-14T19:31Z,"ok its not just me there is a huge problem with this game and amd cards with flickering shadows, many youtube video out with my same exact problem. but heres a fix!!  Navigate to %LOCALAPPDATA%4A GamesMetro LL and open user.cfg with text﻿ editor.
Locate line r_api 2 and change it to r_api 0 for DirectX 9 renderer.
Change user.cfg to read-only to prevent the game overwriting changes."

,omgzelda,2013-05-14T21:59Z,"I found a fix to everyone complaint  about the Russia menu's, etc.

When you run the setup.exe Click the RU button (Russia) and it switches to EN (English) from there you can browse and install your game. My game started up in 1920x1080p Resolution so I don't know how to fix that problem. Maybe get a better computer? idk.

Also had a wierd bug the first time i started up the game. I watched the first cutscene then got a blank screen of the guy walking off into the tunnel with no options (start game, options, etc...) A quick restart fixed that problem though.

,Sivos,2013-05-15T10:59Z,"I had to use a translation app on my iPad to change the language in the game from Russian to English, but I got it to work, lol.  If the installation is Russian for you, make sure to hit the RU button to change it to English.  When you get to the main menu, try to use common knownlege from your years of playing video games to figure out where the language option is.  I think the Options menu was the 3rd from the left.  Either way, it's near the far right of the screen.  2nd or 3rd from the list, but you'll know you're in the right area when you see two sections of scroll arrows under a few check boxes.  The bottom one is voice language and the top is text.  The voice should already be set to English so just match the two words and back out of that to apply it.  It should work."

,davidgbf3,2013-05-15T22:05Z,It worked! Thank you very much HeroMaster! People you just need to use Skidrow crack instead of NoDVD found into the torrent. The Skidrow crack changes the language to english. During the instalation you must change the button RU to EN (on the first screen).

,xAdidas,2013-05-15T23:07Z,"Some clarifications to people having questions/issues:

1- Game comes in all languages that steam is avalaible, to change the game language you need to edit the steam config file that comes in the nodvd folder in the downloaded folder. However, the installer is only available in RUSSIAN OR ENGLISH, NOT THE GAME.

2- If you're wondering about lag/fps go to www.canyourunit.com it will auto-scan your pc and tell you if you can, if you're below the recommended settings I wouldn't recommend playing this right now until a patch comes out, I have a i7-920 hd 5870 and 12gb ram and in some places I get 120 I turn around and can get anywhere from 5 to 20.

3 FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION! IF YOU FOLLOW THEM IT WILL WORK:

1) Download the torrent.

2) Run setup.exe and install the game

3) Copy the contents of the folder NoDvD in the main game directory.

4) Play

TO MAKE THE GAME IN YOUR LANGUAGE GO INTO STEAM/STEAMAPPS/COMMON/METROLASTLIGHT AND EDIT steam_rld.ini (YOU SHOULD HAVE IT IF YOU FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTION AND PASTED THE DATA FROM THE DOWNLOAD FOLDER). THEN SIMPLY REPLACE RUSSIAN BY YOUR LANGUAGE (ITALIAN, RUSSIAN, ENGLISH, ETC!)"

Point is, don't be discouraged if you don't have a high end rig, if it's as good as mine, you'll be able to play it."

,Xivlex,2013-05-16T09:11Z,"Thank you for the awesome torrent. It worked properly and I had absolutely no problems with it.

Just remember to change the default directory. haha.
"
,Xivlex,2013-05-16T09:13Z,"Oh btw. When I play the game I noticed that you have to hold down sights to aim. It's such a small problem, I know, but it really ruins the whole PC fps experience for me.

So does anyone know how to change the setting to toggle ADS? I tried searching the settings. No dice."
,Dark_Lunacy,2013-05-16T10:41Z,This game fucked up my Windows 8 for some reason. Played 20 minutes then my computer crashed and i wasn't able to log in again because of numerous errors. Now i have to reinstall. Thanks a lot.
,BWX232,2013-05-16T11:06Z,"Well I got it working after a few tries without getting the thing to run. Finally it did. BUT- the pause menu screens are all FUBAR and unreadable, so the game is kind of screwed up and sometimes unplayable.


Did anyone figure out how to fix that? I might just buy the game, but I hate paying for short corridor shooters. I want open world games like FC3 that take a long time to play, I pay for those all day long.  Metro LL is pretty damn buggy, not sure if I'm going to buy it yet."
,WarBall,2013-05-16T14:02Z,"There is no way to switch it to toggle to aim down iron sights, the game is meant to be played exactly how it is. It's the small things they have put into it that make it so great. Sorry if your finger gets tired, play more games."

I had to set a few minor adjustments to the graphics settings as it didnt auto adjust. Overall great torrent, even better game. I will seed for a week thx :)"
,XxXxAssassinxXxX,2013-05-18T13:04Z,"Kwaves: You need to copy the crack for the game to work. Go to your download, open the Metro folder, then open NoDVD, copy all its contents then paste it in the folder where you installed the game. Hope this helps."

,Last_Lite,2013-05-19T04:38Z,Lol is the text supposed to be in all russian? I did as said and switched the language in the steam file but still the text in game is russian any fix?
,dragonov5,2013-05-19T11:08Z,"Well, i just played through a big portion of the game, but when i started it up again it hadn't saved. Does this torrent not save your progress?"

,FluxyFlux,2013-05-21T11:24Z,I'm sure it sounds stupid but I really don't want to install to steamapps. I will try to install to program files. Will report back. If this doesn't work I'll just dl the reloaded one.
,SliiFer,2013-05-21T20:03Z,"The same error of Last_Lite In the description say: 

Language: Russian (RUS) / English (ENG) / MULTi9
Sound language: Russian (RUS)

But I cant change the text. When I change the ""steam_rld.ini"" I dont know if I do any change, but isnt spanish.

Anyway, if you can provide me a spanish translation of the text, I'll apreciate this.

Thank you."
,bnagy9,2013-05-22T22:57Z,"The game works fine but when i start the game there is no sound whatsoever, and i have the volume turned up in game and on my computer. I also have followed the steps to change the language to English but no sound plays."

,EvilCorporateWhore,2013-05-24T06:37Z,"Torrent worked perfectly... although i downloaded the update and used the crack in that, not in this one. So i didn't have to change any settings like resolution or language, or anything.

Finished the game in a few days... not playing again in Ranger Mode. Really an amazing game, definitely worth buying for the fans out there."
,atom608,2013-05-28T05:36Z,Very dispointing. I had a fast as download 1.2mbps dl which is the max speed i get for torrents then. Fuck me the hole game is in fucking russian. I change it to english in the .ini BUT STILL FUCKING RUSSIAN. So i try downloading the most seeded metro last light and get 5kbps for the dl. Fuck me right>?
,atom608,2013-05-28T20:17Z,Please fix the game not saving. I got it to run in english and everything and now it dosent save so theres really no point playing this game unless it saves. Can someone help?

,ncko10,2013-06-01T03:39Z,"For the language problem, i fixed it on the first page of installation after opening the setup.exe. where it has the 3 buttons at the bottom: RU and 2 russian things. Just click RU and it changes to EN and becomes English."
,ronan17,2013-06-03T13:24Z,"works fine with update 4, after you click the install button...on the bottom left of the  install menu is a button that says ""RU"", if you click that it will change to ""EN"" and install in English, thank you uploader."
,danwat1234,2013-06-03T13:35Z,"This torrent works fine. No you don't need Steam. When you see the ""RU"" button in the installer, click it and then it will say ""EN"". Just have it extract to a folder, it doesn't have to be in the steam folder.
Then copy over the stuff from the nodvd folder, modify the steam_rld.ini file to change the language to english and there you go. It is a standalone game (no registry entries).

Runs well. Only takes 8.55GiB installed and levels load surprisingly quickly for how complex this game is.  Barely runs on my G50VT laptop.

Issues; the sound echo affects sometimes are too abrupt. Also the wavy air from heat from your lighter and from pots and pans in the kitchen are way too pronounced. "
,maskaman,2013-06-04T13:23Z,THANKS ALOT its just 1 click! Text and language is all english! Completed the game actually :D I got the good ending
,blind_shooter,2013-06-09T04:53Z,"This is the second copy I downloaded that won't install properly. Windows 8 64 bit. During install both games say

How can both versions have the same exact problem during install"
,Sinister181,2013-06-12T18:14Z,"To everyone here saying it's English, I chose the English option for installation and wrote ""english"" in the steamrld.ini and it's still in Russian. Either I'm missing something here, or you guys are bullshitting."
,Sinister181,2013-06-12T18:25Z,"After switching to English on the installer, and modifying the text document, the entire game, menus etc are still in Russian. Why am I not surprised?"
,Sinister181,2013-06-12T19:40Z,Nevermind. The language problem was fixed by downloading the latest update. No more crashing either. :D
