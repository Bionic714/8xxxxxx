,IzayaOrihara,2013-05-14T09:12Z,Don't complain about seeders for at least another 2 weeks. It will always take 1-2 weeks for the ratio to equalize a bit.

Thank you guys for what you do! and thank you for the game!"
[V],HeroMaster,2013-05-14T09:33Z,"@ALL Attention Guys:-

Additional install note:

If the PhysX Setup runs into any issues after step #2 on your system
finish installation by closing any message boxes and then navigate to the
dir where you installed the game. Navigate to ""redistPhysX"" and run the
setup manually"

,AlexDeg,2013-05-14T17:00Z,"Downloading!! I hope this works. Thanks a lot!

@Tarli Check if you have the ""-offline"" parameter in the shortcut of the game. That's causing the debug console after intro."

Locate line r_api 2 and change it to r_api 0 for DirectX 9 renderer.
Change user.cfg to read-only to prevent the game overwriting changes."

,TruWING,2013-05-14T23:55Z,"Just finished downloading. Currently going through with installation.

Because I'm grateful to everyone that was and continues to seed, I'll continue to seed myself so others can get this downloaded and get on with playing.

UPDATE: Installed just fine. Other than a minor Windows 7 related ActiveX error likely related to my specific PC and my driver versions, I encountered no errors with installation. 

I'm currently looking at the games' Main Menu, anxious to jump in and get cracking. Happy gaming, everyone! "

I had to restart my computer. After this happened I started the game again and attempted the same thing, this time it worked with no problems. Thanks HeroMaster for another great upload. Although I am hesitant to change the res again!"
,geodecent,2013-05-15T07:11Z,how do i change it then? from the menu the resolution is blank and whenever i try to change it it crashes my game. I also tried the benchmark but whenever i go in it doesnt look like its in 1080p?
