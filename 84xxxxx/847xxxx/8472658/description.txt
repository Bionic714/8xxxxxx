Every day we walk across its surface, admiring its variety of plants, animals, and landscapes. Earth has taken billions of years to evolve into the planet we now inhabit. This volume examines this long history, from Earth's origins in a cloud of gas and dust to its place as a planet teeming with life. It addresses questions that scientists have long debated: how, why, and when did Earth form and develop into this complex and intriguing planet?
