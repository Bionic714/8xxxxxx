,spancer_87,2013-05-19T21:29Z,"This is as good as any dvd rip. And as far as dvd rips goes, it's 10/10 Audio/Video , and 7,5/10 for the movie itself. 
Nickolas Hoult is superb, and you can't go wrong with Teresa Palmer!"

Pretty good movie with decent acting. The story is well made. But, lack of action (for me) and it sometimes gets pretty boring. But anyways i would suggest you to watch this."
,DzMT,2013-05-22T19:06Z,Everytime I try to play this on my VLC player it wont play why doesn't it work?

Very immersive movie once the story gets going."
