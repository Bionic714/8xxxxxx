,Dimmis80,2013-05-14T13:22Z,"Good day bro Nepo.Another great release i can see.Btw this days the downloading won't go so fast than before for me.I don't know what is happening.I used to have them with 1.2MB/Sec witch is my limit for my connection in an our or 2 u know sometimes goes 500kb and goes up and down in torrents but now it goes kinda slow 100-150 and i have them in ours.If its a seeding thing please people seed more so all we can have them
 quicker.Have nice week dude."
,likepend1,2013-05-14T14:45Z,@Dimmis80: same problem here! i have always been seeding at 100k and had a great download speed at around 1MB/sec. Seems that more and more people are disconnecting when the download is complete. ... this really sucks hard ... :/
[V],Nepotu,2013-05-14T17:08Z,"That slow speed depends on no. of seeders. This torrent was very young at the time of your DL. That's the way it is. Please, be patient!"
