In this episode: King Rob robs his wife of a tranquil night while some daring ladies rob Theon of any gray joy he might have bleakly yearned for. 

The former scene is censored with a good mix of bars and experimental (but highly effective) sub-picture editing. The latter scene is removed entirely (yes, I know how much you're all eager to splice together the few dozen Theon torture scenes to form one 2-hour extravaganza, but I suggest an uncensored copy for that). 

Enjoy!
