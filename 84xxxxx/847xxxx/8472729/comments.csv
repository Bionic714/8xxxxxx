Can you explain a little of the benefits/features of this modded version? I am still confused
Thx"
,Piratefroggy,2013-06-06T02:32Z,"@^ its quite simple actually. This installs a cracked google play store, which is exactly the same as the original one in looks. (except the app icon is different looking.) What this does is it installs a cracked License Verification Library. What this does is simple - Alot of applications on the play store Check to see if you have actually bought the app, and if you haven´t, you can´t open it. The cracked License verification library tells the app that you have bought it. So you can use the app freely:) "
