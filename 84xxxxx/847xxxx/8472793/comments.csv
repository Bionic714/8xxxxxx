,bangcok,2013-05-23T18:18Z,the patch is detected as a malware by most antivirus. anyone know whats the problem?
,pirate_pacman,2013-05-24T00:32Z,"@rahq;verve55 and anyone else experiencing the Distiller problem: I ran into the same problem.

Solution: Uninstall and reinstall according to the prescription. Only this time, test-run the two applications (Acrobat and Distiller) in every step.

To some surprise, that apparantly worked."
,pirate_pacman,2013-05-24T00:35Z,"Oh, and thanx ChingLiu of course for another fine piece of upload."
,Parad0x1,2013-05-24T18:36Z,"Alright, I followed the instructions and things seem to be working fine. Though I wonder, the instructions stated that I should disable automatic updates for Adobe Acrobat, but should I also disable them for Adobe Reader? Or doesn't it matter?"
,rahq,2013-05-27T13:19Z,pirate_pacman: what application did you use for test-run? a have Never test-runit anytihing :)

,serialdownloader,2013-06-09T10:48Z,"Works great for now, though I can't notice any visual difference between the trial and the cracked version. I guess I'll know for sure after 30 days, LOL...

One small side note: Version XI has problems open/converting local HTML files with file paths containing hash signs (#), something that version X had no problems dealing with. Changing the file path solves the issue, though."
