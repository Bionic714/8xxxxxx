,missworld,2013-05-14T15:00Z,Is it Cinavia protected aoloffline? Or is that too much to ask? 
,odexus,2013-05-14T17:03Z,"Will wait the real bluray version, itunes has a lack of quality esp. 1080p. Thanks anyway for this!"
,hossam1asd,2013-05-14T20:02Z,A/V ?
[T],stevekasian,2013-05-15T07:19Z,"By the looks of the screens, V=shit. But then that's what you get when you encode 1080p video @ 4876 kbps. What a waste. The smallest file size for a 1080 movie of this length should be around 9GB, compressed. Anything less and you're short-changing yourself. Why even upload a 1080p version at all? Thanks for nuthin'."
