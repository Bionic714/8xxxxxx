
Dive down and immerse yourself in your own underwater world every time you use your device.

Explore the pristine waters of a deep ocean environment teeming with exotic sea life. Discover a sunken ship, coral reef, and more as sunlight glints off hidden treasure. Schools of fish swim past you while a manta ray glides overhead. Or, dive into shallow seas and drift in azure blue waters - it's all up to you. Watch closely and you may even see a shark in the distance!

Interact with the fish that swim nearby and the hidden treasure. Customize your dive experience with hundreds of combinations - hide the ship, change the treasure to a diving helmet, choose from 'Shallow Seas' or 'Coral Life' themes, and much more!
