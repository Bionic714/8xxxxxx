What's in this version:
2.0.2 Live Global Weather
Live Weather is available in the United States, without the need for a beta trial key! The feature is still in beta though, so please give feedback if you're having issues. Turn on Weather &gt; Live Weather to enable local weather updates.
Unfortunately, our weather provider for non-US regions has rejected us due to high traffic volume, so we're researching alternatives. We will open Live Weather up to non-US regions soon.
