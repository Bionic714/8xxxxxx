IsoBuster Pro 3.2 Final Multilanguage Incl Serial - SceneDL

IsoBuster is an award winning , highly specialized and easy to use CD and DVD data recovery tool. It supports all CD and DVD formats and all common CD and DVD file-systems... Rescue lost files from a bad or trashed CD or DVD disc, save important documents, precious pictures, video from the family, your only system backup.

Start up IsoBuster, Insert a CD or DVD, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present. This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file-system. Instead of being limited to one file-system that the OS picks for you, you have access to "the complete picture". Access data from older sessions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.

Isobuster interprets CD image files, such as:

*.DAO (Duplicator), *.TAO (Duplicator), *.ISO (Nero, BlindRead, Creator), *.BIN (CDRWin), *.IMG (CloneCD), *.CCD (CloneCD) , *.CIF (Creator), *.FCD (Uncompressed), *.NRG (Nero), *.GCD (Prassi), *.P01 (Toast), *.C2D (WinOnCD), *.CUE (CDRWin), *.CDI (DiscJuggler), *.CD (CD-i OptImage), *.GI (Prassi PrimoDVD), *.PXI (PlexTools), *.MDS (Alcohol), *.MDF (Alcohol), *.VC4 (Virtual CD), *.000 (Virtual CD), *.B5T (BlindWrite), *.B5I (BlindWrite), *.DMG (Apple Macintosh), *.IBP (IsoBuster), *.IBQ (IsoBuster), *.NCD (NTI).

Changes:

Support for ExFAT.
Find deleted NTFS files and folders during a scan for missing files and folders.
Implemented a "Find deleted files and folders" option, when an NTFS file-system is selected. This is a much faster scan if you're only interested in finding deleted files and folders in an NTFS file-system.
Support for FATX
Support for XISO / XDVDFS
Extended Master Boot Record (EMBR) support.
BSD partitions support.
* And more ...

Fixes:

&gt;Not all *.png files were found during a scan for missing files and folders (bug introduced in version 3.1).
&gt;Mac HFS file systems with large fragmented files (more than 8 extents) could trigger a program crash.
&gt;In rare cases not all files and/or folders of an NTFS folder were found, if that folder was described in both the MFT record and via INDX records.
&gt;Sometimes too small files were created, when they were fully sparse (one extent, sparse (= all zeroes) (NTFS).
&gt;Fixed it so that the progress bar also changes color (red) in case of errors, during a scan for missing files and folders
&gt;Etc.
