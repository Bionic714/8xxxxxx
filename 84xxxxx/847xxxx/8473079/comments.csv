,vwetv,2013-05-14T19:36Z,those are subtitles in english for the entire movie not just the russian parts. YOU FUCKING IDIOT
,Peter_E,2013-05-14T20:43Z,"Movie is English, not Russian, in case someone misunderstood what Snakesmash81 said (I did...)
And quality is great I would say, nothing to complain about.

Also thanks go to snowbirds for the subtitles. No malware, that's just bull (@ igoturback). 
And they are indeed for the foreign language parts ONLY, contrary to what wetv said."

Pzsucks eat my shit you pussy.I just download movie,audio is english except parts when talks on russian.All good!"
,ufik77,2013-05-15T00:52Z,"@snowbirds - Thanks for the subs for the Russian parts, they work perfectly.

@igoturback - What the heck is wrong with you? Have you never been to opensubtitles.org? It's not great, but it's probably the first or second best subtitle site on the internet. Maybe you mistyped the name and went to some ""tittie"" site?

@vwetv - No, what snowbirds linked to are subtitles for just the Russian parts. Did you download them and take a look? 

I don't know who said ""half"" the movie was in Russian, but that's an exaggeration. The Russian parts amount to about 175 lines of dialog."

Come one guys, without these comments torrents will not work!

,Phatfish,2013-05-15T03:59Z,"@vwetv & Peter_E:

Not sure if retarded...
Almost half the movie is in Russian, not just a few scenes. I couldn't be bothered to download any subs so I'm not sure but I got the impression it doesn't really matter as the movie really has no story. I have been in Russia but the only 5 word I know are: pivo, nostrovia, njet/dha and shlyukha (go figure). Unfortunately I didn't hear any of them so I didn't understand anything they said..."

[T],Tanauser,2013-05-17T07:14Z,"Thanks to the uploader very good copy. A=9 V=9

even with the right subs the story remains so so bad , worst of the die hard"
,YourMomma59,2013-05-18T16:11Z,"LOVE this movie!  Great addition to the Die Hard franchise.  Some of the dialog in the first 1/4 of the movie was a little phoned in on the writer's part, but I watch it to see bad guys get blown away and John McClane save the day.  The subs were perfect for this version - I thought the Russian translated was relevant to enjoying the movie. If they don't work for you, download VLC.  Many thanks to the uploader! :)"
