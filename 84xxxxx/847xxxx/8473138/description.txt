Full Synopsis Cast & Crew


Director W.D. Hogan's sweeping period epic Soldier of God unfurls in the Middle East of the late Twelfth Century. As the story opens, the Knights Templar, a religious order originally assigned to protect Christian pilgrims, has disintegrated from chivalric order and justice into dissolute chaos, as its individual factions bloodthirstily vie with one another for power and control. Rene (Tim Abell, a 'warrior-monk' who counts himself among the Templars' ranks, watches as the Christian army surrounding him is all but extinguished in the 1187 battle at the Horns of Hattin. At the last minute, with his own execution only minutes away, Rene is abducted by Brigands on the battlefield, then manages to escape his captors and flees into the desert, where he faces almost certain death from dehydration. At the last minute, Hasan, an enigmatic Muslim traveler, saves Rene's life, and Rene thanks his new friend, in return, by saving him from Saladin's invading forces. The two ultimately seek refuge at the home of the widow Sohelia, who nurses the injured Hasan back to full health. Meanwhile, Rene finds himself drawn to the vicissitudes of simple life in this newfound oasis, and to the temptation of sacrificing his vows as a crusader for a romance with Sohelia. But Hasan holds a long-buried secret from his past that will soon bring Saladin's armies raining down onto Sohelia's home - igniting a violent cataclysm that will change the lives of Rene and Hasan, irrevocably. William Mendieta, Mapi Galan, Nicholas Kadi and Scott Cleverdon co-star; Kathryn Kuhlen and producer Mir Bahmanyar co-authored the script. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi
