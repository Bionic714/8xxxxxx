,aarque,2013-05-15T06:43Z,"It is great to share but, is there anything new here? Somebody uploaded the 1.1 Majestic Dash, 3 times, in fact, is this one the update..?

 What about the 787, is that the Aerosim? Mine is or was the only AS 787 torrent here, it wasn't good enough?"
,Redneck12,2013-05-15T08:06Z,"Some Of These I Got Off Of Different Sites, And I do give credit to the owners in my read-me files. And Flight 1 Mustang version 1.08 I got myself. Its Not about whats new or not, Im just trying to make available some of the planes others may not be able to get, whether it be seeding issues, or the websites that host them are down."
,Redneck12,2013-05-15T08:07Z,"@aarque  P.S. Yes it was aerosim, but I had seeding issues in the past trying to download it. If You Would Like Me To Remove The Torrent I will."

Support the community by bringing and seeding original and pertinent content and respect your fellow uploaders. Do to them what you would have done to you and your torrents. Thanks."
,Redneck12,2013-05-16T10:16Z,"@aarque Alright, I am a bit new to the whole concept, and I know thats not a good excuse, But I will follow your advice."
