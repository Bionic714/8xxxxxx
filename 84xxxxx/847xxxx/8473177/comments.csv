,omgzelda,2013-05-14T19:08Z,hey nosTEAM did you lose your Trusted or VIP status off piratebay ?
,nosTEAM,2013-05-14T20:00Z,"@ MedoTito :
To enable Hard Ranger Mode:
1: open regedit
2: Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/FLT/Steam/43160
3: Create a new String value called ListOfInstalledDLC with Value data 222801
4: Open game - New game - Select Hard Ranger Mode
5: have fun 



@ omgzelda : because ""too many ads on nosteam.ro website"" not because torrents data"
,Lonecat,2013-05-14T20:19Z,"MedoTito: Go to nosteam.ro. The patch is right there. Or keep waiting, if you want. :)

omgzelda: nosTEAM claims it was because the nosteam.ro site had too many ads. Or so I heard. However, I prefer their releases to big names like SKIDROW these days. :)"
,scammyguy,2013-05-14T21:16Z,nosTEAM steals their releases from other groups and slaps a bunch of SPAM and popups ads on them.
,Skalleg,2013-05-15T01:22Z,"@sammyguy: STFU and actually dl one of ^^nosTEAM^^'s torrents. They're reliable, and best of all, their installation process is ridiculously simple and easy. "
,MikeO89,2013-05-15T04:34Z,nosTEAM may have good uploads but their website is complete trash. They should spend some time on it to make it actually user friendly.
,danikhil,2013-05-15T06:26Z,could you guys please seed this torrent after DL it
,jensenbeach772,2013-05-15T07:39Z,"why is no one seeding , people seed the game after done plzzzzzzzzzzzzz . "

,nosTEAM,2013-05-15T12:30Z,"@ PawlyLove:

I am having 1 issue when I play the game there is a text box on the top that contains a lot of info like FPS-Shadow etc... I followed your intructions that you place down below ( go to line ""stats on"" and change it to ""stats off"" without quotes) After I did that the bar still remains is there something else I need to do??? please help "
,Arcalamus,2013-05-16T04:11Z,The link to the download for the patch on your website is super shitty. It's making me wait 60 seconds just to download and then it downloads at less then .2 mb/s unless I pay like $50. Can you stop with your moneygrabbing bullshit and upload to a respectable site.
,Arcalamus,2013-05-16T04:11Z,Oh and your website looks like it was designed by a 13 year old in 1999

,OddTaco98,2013-05-16T05:03Z,"Nosteam i really upset with this torrent man. I have downloaded 25 or more games from you and this one was by far the worst. Yes i have had small issues with you games before but nothing more than a few clicks and they were fixed. This time though i don't know what the fuck happened. After the installation of the game i opened it and noticed the stats screen after exiting and looking on this page to see if anyone else had gotten the same problem i saw that another person had commented about this. I then read what you had replied with and tried it for my self several times and each time no luck the damn thing kept coming back. Around the fifth time or so of doing it i came into the game and my screen had shrunk drastically i could barely even see the start up menu. Please nosteam find a fix for this and upload a new torrent or patch. I'm sure that other people are experiencing the same problem.  

p.s This is the one game i really wanted this year."
,Pro4208,2013-05-16T07:12Z,"Anyone who is having problems with the stats:

On the main menu, click on options. Click Use default settings. Restart the game and they should be gone.

Taken right from the NosTeam website. 

It worked for me. Hope this helps."
,DELTA3318,2013-05-16T07:25Z,"@Pro4208 

Thank You Your method worked once agin thank you and thank you nonSTEAM for the torrent keep up the good work "
,Pro4208,2013-05-16T07:57Z,"@DELTA3318

No problem, glad I could help.


Also, im happy to support this nosTEAM torrent and any other. This was the first time I had any real issue with any of their games and it literally took under 5 minutes to fix. 

If TPB still had the +/- ratings I would give this torrent a + even though it had the Stats issue. 

Btw, why did TPB get rid of that rating system??"
,devilboy0023,2013-05-16T22:21Z,:'( the download was at 96% and suddenly it decided to start again from 0% someone knows why this happened?
,Thariq,2013-05-17T07:04Z,Hey Nosteam do you think you could get Mass Effect 1 and 2 on the piratebay.
,zaidiraq,2013-05-17T20:25Z,thank you very much ^^nosTEAM^^ thank you for your hard work on this game  i download the game and download the patch for your Site the game work perfectly thank you again ^^nosTEAM^^ and God keep you save
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-17T21:55Z,"I've tried this for days now.
ReInstalled many times over.
Redownloaded 3 times now.
Tried the Day One patch when you released it, and the new one a few times after you released it as well.
I just can't get it to work.
It isn't the stats screen issue.
It's actually a fullscreen developer's debug console.  I can't close it, it won't show the actual menu, I can't get it to do anything.
I fiddled with the settings directly from the user.cfg files (there are two I know of), that didn't help.
Forced DirectX11, didn't help.
Forced DirectX 9, didn't help.
Forced certain resolutions, no luck.
It seems, sadly, that this is the first nosTEAM game I absolutely can't get working.
I literally have them all, and I plan to continue collecting them.
You do good work, nos.
This seems to be a specific issue that even some legally-purchased copies have, and I can't sort it out.
For the record, PhysX, DirectX, Visual C++, and .NET are all updated.
Video card drivers are updated.
Latest patch as of this posting is downloaded.
Compatibility settings tried, everything tried."
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-17T22:31Z,"Actually, I managed to get the debug menu to close (though I have to do it at every startup), but now I get a CTD.
I meet the system requirements (easily) and am running W7 (x64).
Seeing as how these CTDs are regular amongst all releases and legit versions, I'm sure it will be patched soon enough."
,rokikillerwtf,2013-05-18T11:51Z,"cant wait for this to download

btw nosteam can you please upload fallout new vegas with all dlcs and maybe fallout 3?"
,Vans21,2013-05-18T14:43Z,please seed!! ._. it says 2 weeks left..-.-
,roybi505,2013-05-18T16:19Z,"when out plz upload ""Call of Juarez: Gunslinger''
 its on my wishlist for a lot of time
btw metro ll is a grate upload by u keep it up"
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-19T04:00Z,"@roybi505
You'll be delighted to know that nos has a section set aside for it on the site.  It'll be posted as soon as he (now 'they', I suppose) gets his mitts on it.
Also, for anyone curious, we can also look forward to nos releases of the new RE: Revelations and GRiD 2!"
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-19T04:03Z,"@rokikillerwtf 
It's more effective to go to his website and mention requests directly in one of the designated request threads.
I think there was a definitive 'NO' to the fallouts and Elder Scrolls, but now that Skyrim is up, we might actually have some luck convincing him to get the other Bethesda Best's out.  (I don't see why we can't convince him eventually, they are rewarding games and I can't find any truly DECENT releases on TPB anymore unless looking for a brand new release."
,Vans21,2013-05-19T08:28Z,"Alright,i downloaded the game..i installed it,tried to play it but it has no sound..and the graphics are a bit f*cked up..not the quality,the people..does anybody know how can i fix it?"
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-19T16:30Z,"@Vans21:
Have you downloaded the update patch from the nosTEAM website?  That and making sure you have the latest drivers and redists is the first thing to check."

Dante, this is a part of Windows.  open the start menu, type regedit.  It'll open the program for you.
This is the registry editor.  Whatever you do, DON'T dick around with the settings in here, unless you're doing something very specific and intentional like this.
If you didn't even know what the registry editor was, I suggest you don't fiddle around in it, or else you might end up having to do alot more than try to enable a DLC, integral as it may be."

Shadow, it's a waste of time to request on TPB.  Go to his website and mention your request in the dedicated threads on the forums there.
Not that I can even stand to use his website anymore, but if you really want something, it's the only way anyone will bother to consider your request."
,tops.c,2013-05-21T15:12Z,"Damm at the end of the ""Bandits"" mission you have to kill what I feel is the hardest part so far, well first you have to have the double-barrel shotty as primary with full nades/ammo I keep getting double teamed by these fuckers !, anybody know where a good LMG like the one I seen at the end of the 5th or 6th mission. "
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-24T01:08Z,"For anyone who is having the problem of the game launching to a debug menu and promptly crashing when you finally figure out how to exit the debug console, I found the solution.
And I can see why most people didn't have this problem.
Basically, if there is a - (as in dash) anywhere in the file structure to the folder your game is in, this will happen.
For example, installing the game in C:- gamesMetro Last Light or C:GamesMetro - Last Light will cause this problem.
Simply rename whatever folder has the dash and remove it."

It was fine before the patches."
