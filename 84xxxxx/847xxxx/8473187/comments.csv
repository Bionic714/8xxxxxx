,Steriiotype,2013-05-16T04:47Z,"@ dafix123
No this is not like twilight, because the acting is actually good. Nicholas Hoult did such a good job. And great quality!! Thanks so much"

Well worth a look.
Its a refreshing Zombie spin.Nice mash of Day of the Dead meets Romeo & Juliet meets Shawn of the dead.
Its fun And Ironymon obviously needs a hug or a loving home to go to."

,dehezeus,2013-05-16T22:42Z,"A - 9
V - 9

M- 10 - This is one of the best zombie movies i''ve seen. Combining horror, action, comendy, love, romance, Irony and finally a universal message at the end of the movie."
,murtaza786,2013-05-16T23:30Z,"so i watched the movie a:9 v:9 m:5
i expected the movie to be better. From the trailer the movie and dialogue seemed to be pretty funny but most of the movie was serious. There should have been more hilarious R's dailogues. Anyhow nicholas Hoult did pretty good. 
Spoiler Alert:
it would have been better if R had died from the jump. Some emotion and drama at the end would have been nice instead of a they lived happily ever after"
,SunnyShores,2013-05-17T03:11Z,"Good movie

People tend to not like the movie, but before you watch just know it is NOT your classic zombie movie. if you can get past that it is really creative and funny."

This was an amazing copy. For people bashing this movie, look at it like this:

If you liked Fido-watch this. If you liked Wall-E-watch this. if you liked both of those movies, you'll LOVE this!! 

I really enjoyed the different spin on the age old well-worn zombie path.

Thank you for uploading this!

,summd15,2013-05-21T03:49Z,"If you're a montreal buff, you'll love this movie, the majority of the battle scenes are shot in the olympic stadium and outside of it which is where the expos used to play. Also the montreal skyline is displayed very well of course with some cgi added to make it a movie and also the airport in which M lives is the abandoned airport somewhere right outside of montreal. That's the only real reason I enjoyed it, Montreal baby, it's the best."
,WoofHaley,2013-05-21T21:57Z,kind of stupid movie. the girl is gorgeous though
,Klee63,2013-05-22T07:53Z,Entertaining if you have time to kill. F ugly guy gets kinda hot towards the end. Would of loved to see more of him. Begrudgingly liked it.
,Fritz.,2013-05-22T23:21Z,"good audio and video, movie is awful though.

i turned it off after about 20 minutes.

i mean seriously in the first 20 minutes the dude eats his crushes brain and takes her prisoner. And its supposed to have her like coming around being like ""aww your sweet, i dont mind that you killed my last boyfriend and ate his brains"" 

i had to turn it off. at best its like watching a zombie movie of stockholm syndrome."
