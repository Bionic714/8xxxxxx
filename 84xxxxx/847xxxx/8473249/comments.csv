,GatsuRage,2013-05-15T17:49Z,"can't believe the intro, which probably be the only thing of the game without sound.... has NO VIDEO AT ALL AT YOUTUBE!!!!!  gosh I hate the world, they upload even their mothers having sex, but nobody can't upload the intro of a dam game -.-"" fk it, I will have to redownload whole game again... have to look for the 8gig (with 8 language I dun even care about) version.."
,Laurentious,2013-05-15T18:18Z,It's too bad that you can only install 1 voice language at a time and when I want to change I need to reinstall it. Wish you can install both voice language 
,popieloze,2013-05-15T20:05Z,"Great torrent, works without any problems. I just had to change the language to English in the game menu."
,e_STALION,2013-05-15T20:20Z,"just go to folder installation , open the steam_api  with text document and go to the last line, chance the language FROM Russian TO English. After that saved to the desktop first, delete the old ""steam_api"" and move the new one to the folder installation. (that because if you try to overwrite it doesn't accepted.)  Know from the game menu, you can chance and the voice language to english, Russian german."

Try this: in the main menu click on the far right option (настройки - Options), then second from the top (Игра - Game Options) and then change Язык текстa and Язык голосa to English (английский)."
