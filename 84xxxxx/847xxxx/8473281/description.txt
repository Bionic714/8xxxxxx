  The Concept                                                                 
                                                                               
   Imagine mastering your  mixes without causing  the lifeless, squashed,  and 
   over compressed sound that  has become so common  in modern music. We  have 
   all  been at  the mercy  of the  "loudness wars"  for over  ten years  now. 
   Masters have become louder and louder, at the expense of the music becoming 
   harsh  and lacking  punch and  dynamics. One  of the  main causes  of this  
   epidemic is the use of the Peak Limiter to achieve increased levels in  the 
   mastering stage. Peak limiters attenuate transients and often reduce punch, 
   stereo  imaging, can  greatly alter  mix balances,  and cause  a fatiguing  
   result to the ears.                                                         
                                                                               
   Some of the top  mastering engineers have found  ways to combat this  sonic 
   degradation by using techniques other  then Peak Limiting. One of  the more 
   popular techniques is the use of saturation in both the analog and  digital 
   domain. Another popular method is  clipping the front end of  expensive A/D 
   converters.                                                                 
                                                                               
   However, both of  these methods, while  usually more unobtrusive  then peak 
   limiting, have their downfalls. Static saturation curves are not  universal 
   in their ability to sound good on all transients. Clipping greatly  reduces 
   low  end  punch  and  is  very poor  at  retaining  sub  bass.  Both static 
   saturation  and clipping  have a  small window  of gain  maximizing before  
   audible distortion. Enter Slate Digital.                                    
                                                                               
   FG-X Dynamics Rack                                                          
                                                                               
   Two years ago  Steven Slate and  expert algorithm engineer  Fabrice Gabriel 
   started working  out the  concept for  a digital  audio process  that could 
   increase the level of a mix without altering the punch and dynamic feel, or 
   make  the mix  sound squashed  and lifeless.  They started  by researching  
   saturation curves and their effect on various types of transient  material. 
   After several months  of study and  hundreds of listening  tests, they made 
   some  fascinating  discoveries.  What  they found,  was  that  in  order to 
   transparently  add level  to a  mix, a  dynamic and  intelligent transient  
   saturation system would have to be developed.                               
                                                                               
   New  Advanced  Algorithms were  created  to execute  the  extremely complex 
   communication  system that  would be  needed to  properly perform  the new  
   dynamic operations. A new algorithm  was formed, and the process  was named 
   "Intelligent Transient Preservation", or ITP.                               
                                                                               
   ITP - Intelligent Transient Preservation                                    
                                                                               
   The ITP  process uses  a complex  lookahead detection  algorithm to analyze 
   oncoming  transients  and  groups  of  transients.  It  then  optimizes   a 
   specialized  set  of saturation  curves  for that  specific  transient. For 
   example, if the ITP algorithm's lookahead identifies a kick drum transient, 
   it will optimize the algorithm  so that it preserves low  frequency energy. 
   For a  snare drum  transient, it  will optimize  the algorithm  to preserve 
   upper mid range punch.  The result is the  most transparent means of  level 
   maximization the industry has ever heard, with extreme transparency, and no 
   degrading artifacts common to peak limiters.
