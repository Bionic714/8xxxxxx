""The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect"" "
,biteme1011,2013-05-15T00:46Z,iateacrayon  yeah I get the same error message and it's not my antivirus. I tried every trick I can think of including running it in admin mode and compatability mode and the same error pops up. This torrent is a fucking dud which is a surprise since it's from a trusted uploader.
,iateacrayon,2013-05-15T01:28Z,"Got around the error by taking out the abnormal characters in the main folder name.

Now I'm getting debugger code on game start-up."
,boxatoys,2013-05-15T13:18Z,Yep it dont work so don't bother downloading.
,Soulketcher,2013-05-15T16:03Z,"To clarify 

Those of you getting the ""Debug Text"" or the ""Syntax"" errors .. 

MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL TO A FOLDER WITH      !!NO!!       ADDITIONAL SYMBOLS, DASHES OR FOREIGN LETTERS (Russian Text Etc ...)

For example,

Install to:

x:GamesMetro LL

NOT

(As I initially Did)

x:Games - InstalledMetro LL

The ""-"" was not welcome in the installer path.

To test if this is your issue, simply move the entire ""Metro LL"" Install folder to the root of your hard drive of choice.  

The game will launch and does NOT require a re-install .. if you are anal about your file system (as am I) then feel free to install and re-install  .. try the move/rename first though.

Hope it helps, this release, as all the others from Skulled users (For Metro LL) WORK just fine.

Also, I have installed and played this release on the following OS's

Win (x64 for all) 7, 8, and Blue (8.1) "
