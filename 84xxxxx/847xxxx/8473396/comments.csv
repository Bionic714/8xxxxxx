@deltasniper, why would anyone go through the BS of having to get some gay password you put on information that someone already generously shared long before your weak ass showed up?

@anyone, the links for the 30 gigs of live packs is freely available here: http://2no.co/2PgC

DeLtA_Sn1p3r's Torrent's are 100% Legit and all his own. His guide's are all 100% his, none were copied from anywhere else. I have downloaded many torrents from him, To which I have received great satisfaction and a ton of stress relief. I even stopped searching online for solutions, instead I just look for him, if he hasn't made a guide or a .torrent for it yet, I can just ask him. He is a great uploader and always there when someone get's confused or needs a tip. Hell even if you just want a program you can't find he's got your back!

Shit, about a month ago, I had some issues with my pc and it running window's xp. So I emailed him asking for a hand in finding a copy of window's 7 ultimate edition. He was such a good guy, he dealt with my lack of knowledge on it, walked me through the verification process, then uploaded his copy of windows 7 ultimate WITH activator and detailed guide on how to install via usb. then sent me the link to the .torrent. After all that I still wasn't completely sure on the directions, they were crystal clear, but I didn't want to risk my computer just in case. So this man made me a video walk through of the whole install, start to finish. What a good friggin guy! 

So all you nay sayers on her, eff off. it's your choice, Download it or not. Don't go acting like you effin know the guy talking shit when you know nothing about him or this download. Don't like it? Leave! To everyone else, this is 100% legit, no scam, not stolen from anyone. I tryed it, had no problem. If you want it, there's no better place to get it than right here! 

Check out his other torrents too, You might find something else you like/need. I know I did."
,wutwat,2013-05-27T02:17Z,"@delta_sniper: now that you've explained in better detail about what you're sharing I will offer you an apology. since there wasn't any description on wut you were sharing it was easy for me (or anyone) to assume it might not be legit. a little more info wud probably resolve most of that from the git go in the future. anyways,  thanks for taking the time to help unfamiliar users as you've described. tc!"
