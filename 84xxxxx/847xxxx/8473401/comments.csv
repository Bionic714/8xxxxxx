also i wanted to ask if you know if someone has cracked the challenge/response for max6 because i need it for my graduation project.

thanks.

,DeLtA_Sn1p3r,2013-06-06T05:17Z,@kol I would stay with 9.0.1 if you paid for pluggin and cannot re install it but if you can run its setup again I would uninstall old version install new version run your pluggin were you would normally run it hope this helps
,Mike_MC,2013-06-06T17:29Z,"I followed the installation video to the t, also had no problems patching, but whenever I try opening Ableton it gives the error 'The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect'. Any clue what this means or how to fix? Running windows 8 x64..."
,Mike_MC,2013-06-06T23:43Z,"i'm an idiot. This works great. There's an explanation for why this might happen on Ableton's page, just google the error. "
,ThisisXTC,2013-06-09T01:19Z,"I followed every single step and I keep getting this message ""a serious problem has occurred"" I have tried torrents and I still keep getting the same message

Does anyone have a solution for this problem?"
,Mr.Stereo,2013-06-11T02:56Z,"Is this 32 or 64 bit? 

The 32 bit torrent this guy uploaded was the 64 bit version.

So was wondering if this was the 32 bit just mislabeled as 64 bit."
,alex3909,2013-06-11T21:24Z,It doesn't download the authorize.auz I get everything else perfect even the path but not the authorize.auz its nowhere to be found.
