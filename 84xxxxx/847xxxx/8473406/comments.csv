,bragazar1710,2013-05-17T12:05Z,thanks!
,sukuma,2013-05-17T13:17Z,"A & V excellent

Movie fucking sucks so bad. Does not feel like die hard at all, it's basically a shitty cheap movie ""featuring"" Bruce Willis. 

John Mclane is a little bitch being bossed around by his son. 

I give it 2/10 because there is a nice woman in it - 1 point for each arse cheek."
,K_Ranger,2013-05-20T07:51Z,"This version has hard-coded subs, without the subs you have no clue what is going on as a large portion of the flick is in Russian or whatever language they're speaking.  Video and audio look fine -  Try this one if you don't feel like figuring out subs in your burn ..  -  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8475892/"
,garfiel,2013-05-20T10:28Z,"I dunno sukuma did you actually see any other die hard movies??  Lets see he kills a bunch of terrorists wrecks a shitload of cars, blows up stuff, jumps off buildings, pretty standard die hard stuff.

Quite a good movie and excellent quality with the Russian part subs in a separate file.

Great Upload"
,LordKeezah,2013-05-22T22:50Z,Thanx buddy

Story 01
Outside of the car chase scene, this is a sad excuse for a Die Hard flick. And only one hour and 30 minutes long? REALLY? Sad. But I guess it would have to be. Nobody could stand to sit through it for much longer.  The Die Hard franchise is apparently dead.  Too bad. "
,JohnSchi,2013-05-28T04:20Z,"Thrilling movie, nice video and sound. Very good job! Thanks!!!"
,Primuz017,2013-05-29T06:08Z,It's coming a new die hard in 2015 XDD
