It Is the Year 2034

Beneath the ruins of post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of the Metro
the remnants of mankind are besieged by deadly threats from outside and
within. Mutants stalk the catacombs beneath the desolate surface, and hunt
amidst the poisoned skies above

But rather than stand united, the station-cities of the Metro are locked in a
struggle for the ultimate power, a doomsday device from the military vaults
of D6. A civil war is stirring that could wipe humanity from the face of the
earth forever

As Artyom, burdened by guilt but driven by hope, you hold the key to our
survival the last light in our darkest hour
