ΓÇ£Hallo Spaceboy...ΓÇ¥

Commander Chris Hadfield, currently on board the International Space Station, has just tweeted his version of David BowieΓÇÖs Space Oddity.

HereΓÇÖs what his Tweet said:

A revised version of David Bowie's Space Oddity, recorded by Commander Chris Hadfield on board the International Space Station.
With thanks to Emm Gryner, Joe Corcoran, Andrew Tidby and Evan Hadfield for all their hard work.

ItΓÇÖs possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created and you may recognise the name of one of those involved in its creation.

WeΓÇÖre talking about Chris's fellow Canadian, the lovely Emm Gryner, who was a part of the Bowie live band in 1999/2000. HereΓÇÖs what she said on her blog (http://smarturl.it/EmmBlog) regarding her involvement:

ΓÇ£The task was in front of me. I came up with a piano part. i then enlisted my friend, producer and fellow Canadian Joe Corcoran to take my piano idea and Chris' vocal and blow it up into a fully produced song. Drums! mellotrons! fuzz bass! We also incorporated into the track ambient space station noises which Chris had put on his Soundcloud. I was mostly blown away by how pure and earnest Chris' singing is on this track. Like weightlessness and his voice agreed to agree.
And voila! And astronaut sings Space Oddity in space! I was so honoured to be asked to be a part of this. You wouldn't get too many chances to make a recording like this and not only that, to make music with someone who - through his vibrant communications with kids in schools to his breathtaking photos to his always patient and good-humoured demeanour - has done more for science and space than anyone else this generation. Planet earth IS blue, and there's nothing left for Chris Hadfield to do. Right. Safe travels home Commander! ΓÇ¥
