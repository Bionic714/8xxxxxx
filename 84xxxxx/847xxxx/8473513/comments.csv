,Teraflops,2013-05-16T03:11Z,"VIRUS INFECTED!!!

THIS IS NOT A FAKE VIRUS ALERT!

Win32/Ramnit.A

Once infected, it replicates and injects it's code into almost all files and NO ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE can fix it for good. Disk wipe is only option that's get rid of it.

For more details, GOOGLE Win32.Ramnit.A

It costed me a lot of time and lost data.
FUCK YOU UPLOADER IF YOU DID THIS INTENTIONALY!

STAY AWAY OF THIS TORRENT!!!"

,Pr0kurator,2013-05-16T22:29Z,and same here.. Virus Win32/Ramnit ... i must format HDD now !!
,Teraflops,2013-05-18T08:01Z,"TO ALL INFECTED!!!

THIS VIRUS/BOT COLLECTS PERSONAL INFO, PASSWORDS AND CREDIT CARD INFORMATION STORED ON YOUR PC AND FORWARD TO AN EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS.

IF INFECTED, CHANGE ALL PASSWORDS IMMEDIATELY, EXPECIALLY FOR CREDIT CARDS!!!

WHEN REFORMAT HDD, MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT KEEP ANY FILES WITH EXTENSION:

EXE
DLL
HTM
HTML...

(not sure about other txt/xml files)

BECAUSE VIRUS INJECTS IT'S OWN CODE INTO THESE... (ACCORDING TO INFO I GATHERED DURING RECOVERY OF MY OWN HDD)

IT ADDS 53 KB OF OWN DATA TO EVERY FILE IT INFECTS, SO, IF THERE IS SIZE INCREASE/CHANGE - DELETE IT - OTHERWISE, IF EXECUTED OR OPENED, YOUR PC WILL BE INFECTED AGAIN!!!

IF THERE IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY NEED TO BACKUP PRIOR REFORMATTING, USE AN EMPTY EXTERNAL USB DRIVE TO GET ABILITY TO SCAN FILES AFTER REINSTALL.

DOWNLOAD MICROSOFT ESSENTIAL ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE BECAUSE IT CAN DETECT IT IN REALTIME (SOME OF MOST KNOWN AV SOFTWARE DON'T) AND SCAN YOUR SISTEM THOROUGHLY AT LEAST 2-3 TIMES.
