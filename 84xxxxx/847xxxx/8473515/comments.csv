Please help."
,mikecky666,2013-05-15T05:59Z,"Hi funtua,

Pls help on how you managed to reinstall the v2.0. I too have accidentally updated to v2.0.6 and now i'm screwed..."
,dalsimpilot,2013-05-15T06:07Z,Could you make fd2.0.6 fold structure?
,funtua,2013-05-15T18:16Z,"Mikecky666
Just search Jeppview on TPB and look for this post...Jeppview JeppFD iPad v2.0.0 ipa 

All the details are in there.

All the best."
,slackerlt,2013-05-15T20:10Z,as funtua mentioned the problem the same in my fd also no airways no route just charts working any idea?
,slackerlt,2013-05-15T20:10Z,"for 2.0.6 cycle install instructions : 
1. Copy files from the folder TermChats from the new base and add into the same folder at your iPad. New directory is JeppFD/JeppFD.app/DemoData/TermChats.
2. Copy 2 folders ""db1"" and ""store"" from the new base from directory Enroute/db_a and add into the JeppFD/JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database. The next copy the same 2 files BUT from the Enroute/db_b and add to the same directory the JeppFD/JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database. Good luck!!!"
,JAB69,2013-05-15T23:03Z,slackerlt your instructions do not work on latest ios as those folders on the ipad are locked
,mikecky666,2013-05-16T11:09Z,"Thx funtua. 

Have tried it but unable cos my ipad not jailbroken as mentioned by the instructions. Any kind soul with other ideas or new data base for v.2.0.6?"
,antoniomg,2013-05-16T17:19Z,Does this version for IPad include VFR aerodromes charts?
,NiceLittleRabbit,2013-05-16T19:58Z,"First of all, thank you to afil-fr for this torrent

@slackerlt: I do not understand your last step, where you propose to copy the same two files from Enroute/db_b into JeppFD/JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database: in this case, the two files having the same names as the preceeding ones, if we save them in the same folder they will simply replace the ones we just copied?

Could you please clarify this point?"
,flybyware,2013-05-17T02:19Z,PC Version please
,ninobat,2013-05-17T03:18Z,PC VERSION PLEASE !
,RodrigoAviation,2013-05-18T01:00Z,"I successfully installed this into Jeppesen TC, but I'm also having troubles with JeppFD, once I did what ""slackerlt"" said and it didn't work... Thanks anyway! So, any ideas? Thanks for the great torrent! "
,parepe,2013-05-18T17:11Z,"I have installed it on 2.0.0 FD, but only works for airport charts. No route available and no information on maps. 

Any one with the same problem?

Any help on that?
"
,V1RotateV2,2013-05-24T10:47Z,"Both TermCharts and Enroute charts work perfectly under JeppFD v2.0.0, even with VFR enabled."
,redhill69,2013-05-24T12:01Z,Hi!! How can i downgrade my JeppFD! I have the 2.0.6 version and i would install V2.0 to be able to have en-route working! I'm not jailbreak! Thx!
