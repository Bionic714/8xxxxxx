For someone who only yesterday claimed that ""Mann hasn't been on my radar,"" you've accomplished quite the coup only 14 hours later and earned the gratitude of all lovers of German literature.

Could there possibly be more to come?  As Gustav Aschenbach might say: ""Stay the course!"""
[T],pharmakate,2013-05-14T21:36Z,"@penfag - lol, thanks a lot. I just happened to find a copy of Buddenbrooks lying around yesterday ... so I did what I do. Now I'm thinking I've been wrong to ignore Mann; this looks fascinating. It may take some time to get to the other Woods translations (I now see there are at least three others), but I'll see what I can do. You already have the modern versions of Death in Venice (by Luke and Heim), right? Maybe I'll post them anyway ..."
[T],penfag,2013-05-15T01:22Z,"I have the Luke translation of ""Death in Venice"" but don't know Heim.  It will be interesting to see if Woods eventually publishes a much-needed and fresh translation of ""Stories of Three Decades"" or perhaps the essays."
