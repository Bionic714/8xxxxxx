A serie of Dominie books written by Alexander Sutherland Neill. Here is the three books.
Files:
1-"a_s-neill--a_dominie_dismissed.odt"
2-"a_s-neill--a_dominie_dismissed.odt"
3-"a_s-neill--a_dominies_in-doubt.odt"

These books are old ones, they stands for 1916, 1916, 1920 year dates. Pay attention to the dates.

..and compare these dates to ~1960 - the date when the main Neill's work ("Summerhill - A Radical Approach To Child Rearing") was released, because it is the highest peak of his attempt to understand problems of our civilization. So, Dominie books would be at least as good additon to understand Neill's experience.

Thank you.
