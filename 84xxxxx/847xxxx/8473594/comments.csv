,Mothra67,2013-05-15T06:00Z,anthing in the Public Domain and before 1959 I have.  If it's DC or marvel it's harder to come by....
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-15T07:59Z,"...And once again, Mothra comes up with another priceless gem from our past! As soon as this one finishes, I'll leave it up for seeding for a few days, thru the rest of the week if it gets finished early enough, and I encourage anyone else d/ling it to do the same. Remember, SEEDING IS LIFE!

Yeah, and so's water, and the spice must flow, etc, etc...:) :)"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-15T08:00Z,"...That reminds me: Mothra, what's your scorecard on your Project Superpowers progress so far? Who have you gotten complete collections on, and who's left?"
,Mothra67,2013-05-15T08:37Z,"I got about 5 characters left, 1 the Target, I've been dreading, cuz his series was soooo long, it will be a huge file, like my old Blackhawk file, so most likely it will be last!

but I still have plenty of golden age obscurities to keep everyone DLing! like next by request will be quality comics Manhunter from Police comics, which also starred plastic man and Phantom lady! can't go wrong with that triple feature!"
,arrowgreen426,2013-05-16T00:00Z,"That's cool! I have been looking for the early DC Manhunter. If you see any, let me know!!"
,Mothra67,2013-05-19T03:45Z,Just informing everyone that I will no longer be seeding this UL as my bandwidth is limited and in 4 days my share ratio has reached 12.5   I do hope that the other seeders will keep it going for you all
