,FBInot,2013-05-19T20:43Z,"To the Russian dumb ass's --- FCK YOU!!! And to HM, where are the frigging subs? 60% of this movie is in the stupid ass Russian language and there are no subs to know what these dumb fcks are saying !!! What I did watch and was able to understand in the GREAT and OUTSTANDING language of ENGLISH, the movie was very good. HOWEVER, there is also a problem with the volume as with most of all the downloads from this site."
,FBInot,2013-05-19T20:50Z,COULD SOMEONE HELP ME ADD THE STUPID ASS RUSSIAN LANGUAGE SUBS TO THIS MOVE PLEASE---MAYBE YOU COULD DO THAT HM ?
