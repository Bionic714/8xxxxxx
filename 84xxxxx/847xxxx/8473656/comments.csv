One of the best Bond films ever in my mind. :)

I see you don't get much written appreciation, and HD Audio Rips are what I, personally, have been waiting for. 
A little thanks goes a long way, and its free :)

Thanks again for these great rips. :)"

Well, when I look around it looks like it's quite common that Downloaders doesn't give a Thank You comment or whatever to the Uploaders. 

But I agree - It doesn't take much of your time to write a Thank You and the Downloaders should know that the Uploaders really appreciate when you guys give Thanks! :) "
