,aoxo,2013-05-17T04:59Z,"It's funny how people gripe about the seed to ""leech"" ratio while they're downloading...because they're currently ""leeches"" and not seeders.  Sort of bitching about themselves really.  Obviously for a few days after a brand new game is released, there are going to be alot of people downloading it, but fortunately the people you call leeches, yourself included, are ""peers"" and are fully capable of uploading parts of the file while downloading it.  The ratio has nothing to do with it.  It's multipart downloading.  Peers are just as useful to you as seeders.

Why do half of the comments on any given torrent have to be people bitching about their slow download?  Fix your settings, encrypt your connection so you don't get throttled, ditch xp or increase the half open connection cap..but stop whining all the time."
,aoxo,2013-05-17T05:18Z,"Oh and also...the game crashes if I try to change res, and doesn't display the current resolution.  The UI is bugged and doesn't display properly, making this unplayable.  I got good fps in the benchmark using gtx460(x2), especially when I disabled tessellation, around 50-70 fps, but the game looks a bit crappy in terms of aliasing and antialiasing.  The built in antialiasing method adds quite alot of blur to the edges of everything.

I read something about problems with multiple monitors, but I'll be damned if I'm going to dick around disabling hardware so a game will work.  I had to do that with Dead Island only to find that game was a steaming pile of shit.  If it's not worth a game developers time to test their shit and make it work right for popular configurations then it's not worth my time to play it...all monetary compensation aside.

All the current releases suffer the same bugs, so it's a developer problem.  So I guess for terrible reviews and poor sales to kick in so they get motivated to patch the problems."

,Atheist99999,2013-05-17T06:49Z,"Please don't steal this game. The Devs really put their hearts into it. They worked in unspeakable conditions - sitting on folding chairs, cramped and often without proper heating. They had to bring in expensive gaming rigs from the US in person because customs would simply steal/confiscate the PC's. They spent very little money to make this Gem in comparison to the crap EA and others produce.  

We, PC gamers, rarely get treated well by the devs and ironically, most of the good PC games come from Europe. 

THIS developer HAS to be supported. I signed up just to make this comment. If I dissuade at least one person here from stealing this game then I say it was worth it.

,cingram,2013-05-17T10:50Z,I'm in agreement with Atheist99999 on this one.

1. Its impossible to evaluate a game until its bought and then the game may be crap even though top money has paid for it.

2. The game houses also seem to adopt the policy of charging the highest price possible for a game. A top selling game can like COD can now bring in more money, despite pirating, than a top Hollywood movie.

3. I do buy the games but after trying them out first and only when the initial cost has halved. I will not pay £35-£40 release price for one."

I think a good portion of people would agree that if a game is worth anything and the devs put some good work into it, it will be worth buying. Consider it a 'renting' type of thing, at least I do.

Yes, the vilification of the Nazi regime is becoming far overdone, and I'm sure that eventually the masses will see it for what it is, a Jewish lie.

,tgrazins,2013-05-18T18:00Z,"you ppl are hypocrites.
most of you guys say that you pirate for demoing purposes yet still pirate when there are demos of games available (granted not for every game)

Worst of all you guys try to find the smallest of flaws in the game as an excuse not to purchase and pirate instead.

And lets just be honest here, piracy is stealing. Face facts. Don't try to deny it or illusion yourself into thinking otherwise

And just to clarify, buying the game when it is like 70% off later on is not really justifying you pirating the game. You have to pay more to get the game earlier. (i do feel 60 bucks is too much for some triple A games) If you really don't have the money then don't buy the game now or pirate it. Just wait till you have the money and buy it.

But my reasoning will go on deaf ears so I don't even know why I bother"

this is why most game developers don't respect the PC as a gaming platform (and i know consoles have piracy too)

this is why we can't have nice things because we are too arrogant to support game developers and we feel so entitled that we steal games when we don't have the purchasing power to buy it. "

,Hublo,2013-05-19T08:14Z,"@ aoxo, the holocaust is a jew hoax. Do some research. The jew are behind all evil now, and have been throughout history. Germany was only doing what all nation should do. Defend itself against jewry. The Pirate Bay, is a battle front for the truth like any other venue."
,shmimbadad,2013-05-19T08:22Z,"for everyone getting crashes when trying to change the resolution, or terrible performance, even with decent hardware, or graphical glitches like flickering shadows... it's not the crack. It's the game. same thing for legit copies. get the update 2 patch. fixes all of it."
,shmimbadad,2013-05-19T08:28Z,"also, as that other guy said, yall should seriously spend the money and actually support this game. Devs are amazing, and they deserve every penny. you people (looking particularly at the guy who says in his comment that he has dual $500 GPUs) who spend thousands of dollars on top of the line PCs, and then pirate every single game, are fucking disgusting.

I game on an aging laptop, and can't afford to get a new PC, but I still buy 95% of my games. shit's dirt cheap, all the time, on steam and other stores. only time i pirate games anymore is if I want to test them first (aging laptop), and there's no demo available. Which is actually why I was looking at this torrent in the first place. But upon reviewing the requirements, and hearing about the fixes for ATI video cards in the last patch, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to run it well enough. gonna go buy it."
,shmimbadad,2013-05-19T08:33Z,"and to that recent comment: Deep Silver had nothing to do with the Stalker games. They didn't have anything to do with the first Metro game, either. They bought the rights to publish this one after THQ went bankrupt, when the game was already more than half finished. 4A is the development company that made the game, and they did it in a shitty studio, with power outages, terrible equipment, and sometimes no heat. AND with less than a 10th of the budget of other, much shittier games. AND they gave an immense amount of care to the PC version, specifically, which damn near nobody does anymore."

,blind_shooter,2013-06-09T04:50Z,"This is the second copy I downloaded that won't install properly. Windows 8 64 bit. During install both games say

C:program Files (x86) Metro Last Light/patch.vfs0

An error occurred while trying to copy a file:Source file is corrupted.

How can both versions have the same exact problem during install"
