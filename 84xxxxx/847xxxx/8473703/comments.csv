Do you plan on releasing the entire bond 50 collection? I was also wondering if you will be releasing the matrix trilogy?"
[T],vonRicht,2013-05-16T20:48Z,"At some point in the future I will be releasing The Matrix Trilogy.

Regarding James Bond then I will release all the Bond films with Sean Connery. At least for starters."

What player do you recommend for videos vonRicht?"
