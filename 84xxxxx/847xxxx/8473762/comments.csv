,greasyHampster,2013-05-20T15:40Z,"pro346pro. Thanks a billion. Muchos apprecios'o,, or something.. And the wd media player is the best thing since sliced bread, is it not??? i spent forever trying to figure out what torrents would play on my smart tv(nd not many did). believe it or not it would play the Matrasoka and MP4 but not Dolby audio files which is what most x264/matrasoka are. So you can imagine my fustration. And converting...... Fucking forget about it!!!!!! so if your a pirate with something better than the WD media player. I WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE TO LEARN ABOUT IT."
