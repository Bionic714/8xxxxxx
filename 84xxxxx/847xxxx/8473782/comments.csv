?? do i need to install the free version and then the one in this torrent? or viceversa? why don't ypo explain how to install it chap?"""
,VeeDaub,2013-05-16T02:00Z,"The uploader just copied what it says in the Play Store description. You need to have the free version installed to activate Prime, Nove Launcher is just a locked version of Nova Launcher Prime so this is just an activator to allow the Prime actions to be enabled.

Install free version, install torrent version, success."
,Bloksee,2013-05-16T18:41Z,"Guys, only for the legit way (you know, for people that actually pay and install from the Google Play store) is true that they need to have the free version first, as the Prime version is just an unlocker.
For THIS version, you HAVE TO uninstall the previous free version, as this is the complete (full) and cracked version. So, just do this:
1. Uninstall any previous Nova version
2. Install this version. Done! No key or crack needed.
3. Enjoy!"
