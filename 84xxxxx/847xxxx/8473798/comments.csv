[V],Gh0stNet,2013-05-14T20:07Z,Yes.
,segamon,2013-05-14T20:10Z,I meant cumulative :)
,eluest,2013-05-14T20:31Z,My god! This game is dirty cheap indie and what's more is comes from GoG so there is no DRM. Why the fuck aren't you supporting the good ideas and services? Don't seed or leech this.
,smoke070,2013-05-14T21:46Z,"$10 is hardly dirt cheap by indie game standards, and secondly Phil Fish is known for being a filthy scumbag and I will never give him a cent. Get off your high horse, moron."

,Wuterbear,2013-05-16T03:38Z,"I was unable to get this patcher to Run. I tried running it from the folder it came in, to the game files, to the game content folder all leading to the same end. I get an error message saying, "" ! Game installation not found, please re-install."" which I have done to no avail. What am I doing wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

,specialvictim,2013-05-17T03:56Z,"Fez was crashing constantly on start up for me, but after applying the update 1.06a from Ghostnet it finally works! However the game runs extremely choppy unless i'm inside a house or something. My computer should be more than adequate to run it smoothly. Advice anybody?

running Windows 7 64 on intel core i3 4gb

And GN THANK YOU for this update! I can at least play now although it's super choppy"
