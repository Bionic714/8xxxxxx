You are defenetly a far better upload than CyclingTorrent (which works on up/down loading ratio to atribute priviledge) It's unfair cause I uploaded less than 100Mo since 7day. Which means, that I am invited to pay to buy some fresh priviledge. What a scam! Pay for free from right TV stuff. (They have a very extended choice of bycicle stuff, such as Ironman, XCO, ... though)

wheras I've just uploaded 7Gb to the PTB crowd of your very last Stage 9 Giro 2013 (I've got them all from you). That is what I a call sharing-o-meter frenzy.

You are a proud soon-to-be pink skull, you know that isn't it? 

THanks"
