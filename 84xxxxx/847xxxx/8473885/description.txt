The Ancient Alien Question: A New Inquiry Into the Existence, Evidence, and Influence of Ancient Visitors 
By Philip Coppens (Author), Erich von Daniken (Foreword)


The Ancient Alien Question reveals an array of astonishing truths, including:

A radically different understanding of the pyramids and how they were constructed
The origins of crystal skulls and how they were found
The extraordinary stories behind monuments such as the Nazca lines and Puma Punku, and who built them
How extraterrestrials came to our planet and the evidence that supports this

Analyzing the historical and archaeological evidence, Philip Coppens demonstrates that there is substantial proof that our ancestors were far more technologically advanced than currently accepted, and that certain cultures interacted with non-human intelligences. Our ancestors were clearly not alone.

Forty years after Erich von DÃ¤niken posed these questions in Chariots of the Gods, Coppens provides clear and concise answers to the great historical enigmas in a most accessible and readable format.

Your view of human history will never be the same again!
