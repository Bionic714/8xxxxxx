The Mothership was formed in 2012 by Periphery frontman Spencer Sotelo. Initially, the project had 2 other names, the project was known as Scenery & Endur. Today, The Mothership consists of 3 members, Spencer Sotelo as Vocals, Matt Halpern as Drums &  Nick Johnston as Lead Guitar. Please note that these are webrips, very good webrips. Some parts are a little distorted but nothing that's not tolerable. Enjoy!
