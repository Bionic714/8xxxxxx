Black Dog Barking is the third studio album by the Australian hard rock band Airbourne and the follow-up to their 2010 album No Guts. No Glory.. The album is up for release in Europe and Australia on 20 May 2013, and worldwide on 21 May 2013.

A lot of thought and effort has gone into this record not only by the band, but by the production crew who worked countless hours, seven days a week, even through Christmas and New YearΓÇÖs Eve to achieve the best possible performances, backed by real undying tones. Now weΓÇÖre handing it over to youΓÇª so crank it up, crack a beer and stick some rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ roll in your ear!
