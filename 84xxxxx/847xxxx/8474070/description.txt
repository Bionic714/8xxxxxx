New Lives in the Wild

Travel Documentary hosted by Ben Fogle, published by Channel 5 in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Ben Fogle meets people who have given up the daily grind in favour of a new life in the wilderness.


1)  Australia 
Ben travels to a remote island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef to live with former Sydney businessman David Glasheen. Since losing a fortune in the 1987 stock market crash, which also cost him his marriage, David has led a Robinson Crusoe-like existence. Ben learns how to pick oysters, brew beer, trade fish and dance with the locals, finding out how it feels to truly live alone.

2)  Alaska 
Ben travels north to Alaska to live with Bretwood Higman, Erin McCittrick and their two children. Bretwood and Erin hiked 4,000 miles to get here, and the family now lives for half the year in a Mongolian-style yurt on the mountainside, with the other half spent hiking in the wilderness. While staying with them, Ben learns how to chop trees and protect himself from grizzly bears.

3)  New Zealand 
Ben travels to New Zealand, where he meets the Long family, who live as hunter-gatherers in the Gorge River area of National Park. He helps dad Robert to hunt for rock lobsters and catch eels, while mum Catherine must climb a sheer waterfall to check for storm damage to the family's gravity-fed water pipe.

4)  Texas 
Terlingua, a crumbling ghost town a couple of miles from the Mexican border in Texas, is the last staging post for Ben on his way to meet John Wells, an ex-fashion photographer from New York who has turned his back on the bright lights of the big city to experience a desolate desert dream.
