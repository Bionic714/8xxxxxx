
Discover a peaceful forest teeming with wildlife and surrounded by natural beauty every time you use your device.

Sunlight filters through the trees as a gentle breeze rustles the leaves. Pause for reflection at the path while birds flutter past and deer graze contentedly in the rich foliage and quiet solitude of the undisturbed woods.

Choose the Natural theme, and your forest becomes pristine as you discover a cascading waterfall. Or, rest at your private cabin before setting out on a hike through the woods at the pathway signs - it's all up to you!

Interact with the birds and watch the deer gaze at the forest. Customize the wildlife, flowers, cabin, signs, grass, waterfall, and much more!

Several optional add-on packs are also available for purchase, allowing you to choose the features most meaningful to you:

* The ΓÇÿField PackΓÇÖ allows you to explore a completely new scene featuring a field of tall waving grass, butterflies, additional deer, and more.
* In the ΓÇÿStream PackΓÇÖ, just one of the new features is a babbling brook winding through the forest while a buck sips from the clear waters in changing weather conditions, fish, and more.
* The ΓÇÿCustomization PackΓÇÖ features even more personalization options such as your own text and images in the scene, dynamic time of day, fireflies at night, and more.
