,B1u3d3m0n,2013-05-14T23:25Z,Can this be used with a legit Borderlands 2 game through steam?
,forgetit,2013-05-14T23:36Z,"Why so much smaller than the other one? Judging by the files this does not look like a crackonly either.

,Mozi91,2013-05-14T23:53Z,"NOT WORKING for me,its really small sized for a hole DLC anyway"
,Conceivable,2013-05-14T23:56Z,"Don't download this shit, the extractor is empty. Doesn't work."
,jaktbone,2013-05-15T00:05Z,"Works Flawlessly, If you read the instructions he says that it goes along with the 1.5 update, NO LIE, Doesnt work otherwise, So I think that also means that no, it will not work on legit versions for the reason you don't have that same 1.5 download."
,jaktbone,2013-05-15T00:07Z,"Oh also you need to use the crack to enable the dlc, don't ask me why, I'm don't know everything and I have not virus checked it but, my computer is shitting out so not a big deal to me."
,Conceivable,2013-05-15T00:09Z,"The extractor is empty, dont download this trash, be warned."
,Peach-Fuzz,2013-05-15T00:12Z,"I can confirm that this is working. For the ones complaining about it, if you'd just learn to read readme files we wouldn't have to listen to you complain, but here is how to get this DLC working 100%.

First install the Borderlands 2 1.5.0 update/crack from rylgmr06
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8387720/Borderlands.2.Update.v1.5.0.Cracked

After it's installed use the extractor to extract the files and copy them to your Borderlands 2 install directory and let it copy+replace all. 

After that is done install this torrent, and use the extractor to extract it's files and once again copy the extracted files to your borderlands 2 install directory and let it copy + replace all. 

There you're done enjoy your Krieg and updated Borderlands 2! 
"
,Conceivable,2013-05-15T00:14Z,"Scratch everything i said, it started working randomly. It seems as the files for Krieg are in the update 1.5, this just enables him in the game. My bad. Works as intended!"
,Mozi91,2013-05-15T00:16Z,"ITS WORKING!THANX BRO! 
Instructions:
1)Download and install update 1.5   (http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8387720/Borderlands.2.Update.v1.5.0.Cracked)
2)Download and install this torrent
3)Play with Krieg the Psycho!!"
,Timbo6669,2013-05-15T00:23Z,THINK ITS  FAKE?? 
,Conceivable,2013-05-15T00:24Z,
,ZombieRobot,2013-05-15T00:45Z,Works. Thanks for the upload.
,ZombieRobot,2013-05-15T00:48Z,Works. Thanks for upload.
,dahaka47,2013-05-15T00:55Z,"I understand this is an upload from RoyalGamer? 100% not fake. He is completely trustworthy, I know him personally. His uploads are always of the highest quality.

Cheers Royal, it's Supra. ^_^"
,dahaka47,2013-05-15T00:57Z,"LOL, 38 bytes? Damned Gearbox, so the DLC was completely included in patch 1.5.0, this is just an activator. The hell did they wait so long to release it? Weird."
,noekk,2013-05-15T02:08Z,"Hey guys, if I'm not going to play as this queer character is it even worth installing, I already have 1.5.0."
,Master_Force,2013-05-15T02:19Z,"Works like a charm, don't listen to those people who say it's not. Like the descrption says your game must be updated to the V1.5.0, if it is, have fun with the new class!
Also, you don't even need to use the crack included in the torrent with works wihtout with. (if your game is already cracked with another one of course)."
,Snowman2323,2013-05-15T05:01Z,Works perfectly on 1.5.0!! Thank you!
,SynnDragon,2013-05-15T05:35Z,"Tried it repeatedly with the SKIDROW update version 1.5.0 and didn't work. Reinstalled the rylgmr06's update and tried again, and worked perfect. Was a bit slow, but I also have 9 other programs up."
,reegzz,2013-05-15T08:02Z,"Works perfectly fine with legit steam version. If you have steam version but no DLC, download his DLC unlocker and all his updates. I also play online through steam with cracked DLCs."
,rylgmr06,2013-05-15T13:17Z,"Yea, I like others say and in the NFO; Borderlands.2.Update.v1.5.0.Cracked is required! This won't work without it.
READ PEOPLE! I really don't like people yelling ""FAKE"", just because they can't read...
I am pleased the help you, but please don't yell ""doesn't work"" or ""fake"". 
Also people, SKiDROW didn't release any update v1.5.0! You are maybe refering to that retarded skidrowcrack site, if so, READ THIS:
http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=62569
Also, there is a way you can play this and other DLC with your legit steam copy! I've released an unlocker! Grab it here:

Good luck!"
,airwal,2013-05-15T21:15Z,"it works 100%
thx for upload ^^
"
,Vitez544,2013-05-16T01:32Z,"Works great. Have to have 1.5 patch installed form before and then just install this and thats all. 
Psycho is freaking AWESOME !!!"
,Dj_Ziio,2013-05-16T06:57Z,"thanks for the super quick upload, works perfectly with the update mentioned in the comments above.  Really shady of 2k to include the dlc in the update then charge you for the dlc unlocker , some people have to pay for bandwith and i bet half the update is the character models and his costumes.  Sadly the character kinda sucks.  Gaining health from kills is nice, but usually not needed until its almost too dangerous to use the skill.  The skill trees aren't varied much and require damage to yourself for the best damage output, and when the psycho skill is active your only distance weapon is your axe, which is nearly impossible to hit with, does little damage and has to return to your hand before throwing again, making it one of the slowest weapons in the game.  Not worth the purchase but give it a try yourself and see what you think."
,Matinator10,2013-05-16T08:42Z,"How can you even complain about it being in the update? That is the ONLY way to distribute this DLC, otherwise you wouldnt be able to play online with people who own Krieg. "
,Matinator10,2013-05-16T12:18Z,"How can I unlock the DLC with RELOADED 1.5.0 update/crack? No, I do not want to use the included crack."
,Matinator10,2013-05-16T13:41Z,"Nevermind that, found it"
,AKASHCHA,2013-05-16T17:14Z,"Thanks. 
I need a help. can anybody plzzz upload.

Acute email ids production engine [software]. I need this very much. [16.05.2013]"
,Diyakinos,2013-05-18T06:15Z,"Works great! Made an account just to say so, haha."
,asuki123,2013-05-19T02:55Z,"@matinator

how did you make the DLC work cuz i already have the patch will all the previous DLC but when I installed this DLC it wont show up in the game..

I also tried the crack that comes with this DLC but it fucks up the game no DLC found and my saves games wont show up?"
,Matinator10,2013-05-19T12:08Z,"@asuki
I assume you've got the reloaded crack....go to your Game folder/Binaries/Win32/ and open steam_api.ini. Then there should be a part that says DLC, change it to this:

DLC001=000049536
DLC002=000049537
DLC003=000049538

Most of them are useless at the moment but this will unlock this DLC for you."
,scyris99,2013-05-23T13:10Z,"I need to ask, why is the dlc.exe itself so suspiciously small, shouldn't a new chara be larger than 208 kb?"
,Matinator10,2013-05-23T21:47Z,"If you would take the time to read the other comments...-_-
The DLC is included in update 1.5.0, this pretty much just enables it for use in your game."
,rylgmr06,2013-06-03T22:13Z,Correct. It should also be unlocked when using the crack provided with this release (SR crack)
,Odiegooddog,2013-06-12T19:24Z,Guys i've passed the whole game and uninstaled it. If i get it again is it possible to use someone else's saved games so i can play this dlc? Thanks in advance.
