Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, May 14 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex covers Matt Drudge's warning about the Obama administration's "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into the practice of journalism in the United States. 

Alex covers the unraveling of the Benghazi op and the IRS' attempt to intimidate Obama's political opposition, behavior that has led Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to declare that Obama is "drunk on power." 

On today's broadcast, Alex talks with Jeffrey M. Smith, author of Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods, an informative book available at the Infowars Store. Smith is also the author of Seeds of Deception: Exposing Industry and Government Lies About the Safety of the Genetically Engineered Foods You're Eating.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
