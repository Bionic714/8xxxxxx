Formed in March 2007 in the heart of good ole Johnston County,NC. Blunt Force Trauma has quickly forged a path for themselves in the local underground metal scene. Sometimes with strong musical performances, and other times with an over the top display of alcohol,fornacation,& southern metal pride. Either way BFT is always volotale. The band has shared the stage with the likes of the following killer bands: Stillhope,Jakt,Broadslab,Hold Back The Day,Dyze of Blue,Hostile Enviornment, Elysium,Twisted Misery,Silent Society,Seventh Denial,SinSik,Lus Verlexic,HOW,Southern Sub-Culture,Dirt and numerous others. The band has just released it's 3rd demo entitled "Two seeds and a stem". Which contains 4 tracks from the the upcoming debut full length album "The New Southern Revolution". ..
