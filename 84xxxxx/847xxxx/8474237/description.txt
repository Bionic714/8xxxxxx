team nightmare has taken a big lead this season. Today their score is 2441 to Dragon's 1688. Dragon had decided to step on the mats tonight for her team to try to play catch up. Syd may have gotten cocky. She isn't on the mats to coach her team but she has had the co-captain, Bella Rossi, wrestle tonight. She also has the best grappler on her team ( Darling) on the mats. Perhaps Dragon has been reading "The Art of War" she's allowed her opponent to get arrogant and now she's ready to pounce when they are unsuspecting. Dragon narrowly escapes an orgasm on the mat in this round but can she hold out for the entire match?
