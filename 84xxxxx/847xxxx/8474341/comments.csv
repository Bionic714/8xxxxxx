,malasorte7,2013-05-15T01:19Z,"My pleasure.
Yes, me too. I was thinking that the tittle is canceled already. Anyway i found it around the web and i've decide to uploaded here, since it was missing."
,nbrazil,2013-05-15T06:44Z,It's a game tie-in. How could it be canceled when it has a limited duration by design?
,AnnaBulleta,2013-05-15T08:43Z,"Thanks malasorte7, this has become one of my fave comics of the year, especially after reading MU vs the avengers, that was so lame .it sucks that every chapter is so short."
,malasorte7,2013-05-15T13:13Z,"nbrazil well, one of the comics writters told that he dosen't know for how long this comic would run,...that he will try to keep it even after the game for a while, just like arkham unhinged.But is good that the tittle still goes on for a little while."
,malasorte7,2013-05-15T13:18Z,"AnnaBulleta yes, i feel you. This and Batman Beyond series is all i actually still read when it comes to comics. I guess that those turn of events aren't the usual comic-book run so we all gotta appreciate while we still have it."
