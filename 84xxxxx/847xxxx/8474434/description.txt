
Welcome to the world of Weaphones, the ultimate firearms simulator for your phone or tablet.

Blurring the line between digital and physical, Weaphones combines the two to create a fully interactive real world experience. Switch off the safety, load the magazine, rack the slide and fire, all without having the cops called on you.

Ergonomically designed, Weaphones fit naturally into the shooterΓÇÖs hand. All the important controls are located within a fingerΓÇÖs reach. The ability to resize, flip and relocate the Weaphone assures perfect fit no matter the size of hand or screen.

For the price of a couple of 5.56mm rounds you can have a full arsenal of WeaphonesΓÇª and you wonΓÇÖt shoot your eye out.
