The game's plot revolves around a child named Andy (Guthy in the European game, mostly referred to on screen as "Toy Commander"), who gets new army-themed toys for Christmas, and neglects his childhood favorites. The toys, led by Huggy Bear, Andy's childhood teddy bear, rebel and try to destroy the new toys.
Each boss in the game has taken over a specific area of the house, serving as one of Huggy Bear's Generals.

Basically, you control different toys at different points in the game, you even get to control a jet pack wielding Santa Clause. The wiki on this game claims there were issues with tricky controls, but I played this using Xpadder & Xbox360 gamepad, & it was very easy as far as control go. This is a Dreamcast only game, but it emulates very well.

1) Install.
2) Use the shortcut to launch.
3) Go to "System", then press "Start".

The emulator is already pre-configured for this game, if you want to adjust the reolution, just go into the NullDC settings.
