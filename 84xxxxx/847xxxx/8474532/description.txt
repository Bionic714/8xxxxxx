Hello! This is my first torrent. I've download quite a few amazing pieces of music on here, so I decided its time I contribute back to the community beyond seeding. This is a really awesome band,and I haven't seen this full album download anywhere. You might have heard a few of these songs but never knew the name. It has particularly exploded after a youtuber uploaded some battlefield 3 montages with these songs. So, I decided to buy the album and put together the torrent. I honestly think this will do more good than harm to the band, give them so exposure finally. I think I got all the tagging right, and its in 320kbps quality so sounds pretty great. Its not a rip, but bought online. Also put in a high resolution (not sure if thats good or bad) album cover. Enjoy! Let me know if I made any mistakes.

1. Big personality (Really good)
2. The Right Attitude
3. Burstin' Bubble
4. Soul Company
5. How High
6. Been out of town
7. Stuck at the bottom
8. Exit!
