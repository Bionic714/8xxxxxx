Arts Documentary hosted by Geoffrey Baer, published by PBS in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

10 Buildings That Changed America tells the stories of ten influential works of architecture, the people who imagined them, and the way these landmarks ushered in innovative cultural shifts throughout our society. From American architectural stalwarts like Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright, to modern revolutionaries Frank Gehry and Robert Venturi, this film examines the most prominent buildings designed by the most noteworthy architects of our time.

We see the legacy of these architects all around us: in the homes where we live, the offices in which we work, our public buildings, and our houses of worship. These 10 Buildings represent architects who dared to strike out on their own and design radical new types of buildings that permanently altered our environmental and cultural landscape.

10 Buildings include...
Virginia State Capitol (Richmond, VA)
Trinity Church (Boston, MA)
Wainwright Building (St. Louis, MO)
Robie House (Chicago, IL)
Highland Park Ford Plant (Highland Park, MI)
Southdale Center (Edina, MN)
