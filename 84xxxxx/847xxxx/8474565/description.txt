This 1958 Max Roach record, his 12th as leader, is unusual in several ways:



1) The quintet does not include a piano

2) A TUBA participates on this record; adding bass lines to the standard pizz

   upright bass so that there are (2) bass instruments


3) Included is a nearly 4 minute drum solo which isn't boring

4) The last track is from a different session 7 months prior to this one;

   A Drum and Bass duet featuring Max Roach and Oscar Pettiford (2 legends)

   playing spontaneously


5) This LP is not in the Accurip database




It is hard to go wrong with an album that includes Max Roach's input
