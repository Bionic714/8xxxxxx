Unhappily Ever After (often shortened to Unhappily... in promotional advertisements) is an American sitcom that aired for 100 episodes on The WB network from January 11, 1995, to May 23, 1999, for a total of five seasons.

The series was initially intended to be a starring vehicle for Stephanie Hodge, whose character of Jennie was the focus of the first few episodes. However, the series concept was soon re-worked. The character of Jack (who had been kicked out of the house and was living in an apartment) was brought back home, and began living in the basement. Soon, Geoff Pierson's character, Jack ΓÇö a schizophrenic family man whose only friend is a talking toy rabbit ΓÇö became the central character of the show, along with the rabbit, Mr. Floppy (a reference to the movie Harvey). Also in seasons one and two, Joyce Van Patten played Jennie's mother, Maureen Slattery. When she left the show, she was killed off and buried (off-screen) in the backyard.

By the show's third season it became apparent that Tiffany (Nikki Cox) was becoming a breakout character and the de facto co-star of the show along with Pierson. Stories began focusing on Tiffany and Ryan's high school (and later community college) escapades, and the producers attempted to kill off the increasingly unnecessary character of Jennie, who returned as a ghost. After doing so, however, they quickly reversed their decision because of negative audience reaction. On the show, the character was brought back to life in a deliberately bizarre sequence in which a network executive wandered on to the set and announced Jennie's character was no longer dead. Nevertheless, Jennie was soon gone again, as several episodes later, the character abandoned her family for a lesbian lover (Stephanie Hodge left the show) and was never seen again.

Re-encode of this torrent - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4124694/#filelistContainer

For pure quality, you should use that torrent. However, the source material is VHS tapes (the show hasn't been released on DVD yet) so the quality isn't that great to begin with. Also since H264 is twice as efficient as XVID, re-encoding the files at around 600 kbps will reduce the file-size by more than half without noticeable reduction in quality (in my opinion). 

Episode 419 - Tiffany's Birthday was incomplete the from other torrent, the only other copy i was able to find was of lower quality (320x240 resolution).
