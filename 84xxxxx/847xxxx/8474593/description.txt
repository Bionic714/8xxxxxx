Publisher's Summary:

The Macra Terror lived off a steady diet of toxic gas, the Ogri fed on blood, and even the fifth Doctor was known for his fondness of celery.

However, we humans need something a little more substantial, and Gary Downie has raided the cookbooks of the show's stars to produce a mouth-watering selection of recipes guaranteed to delight your taste-buds.

From all corners of time and space come such exotic delights as Time Lady Tzaziki and Castrovalvan Kebabs, plus Mena's Tachyonic Sauce and Patrick Troughton's Vegetable Soup with Dalek Krotons!

BON APPETIT!
