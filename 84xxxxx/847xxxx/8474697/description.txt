This is CD 2 of Sonny Stitt - Four Classic Albums (minus the first track which is the last track of "Personal Appearance").

It is not an official Verve or Roost release so unfortunately there are no bonus tracks and the remaster is probably not as good as it might otherwise be. It is however a FLAC.
