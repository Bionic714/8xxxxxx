,AlyH,2013-05-16T02:18Z,"Hmm maybe not, when I double click my file storage wars comes up with this title, but then I look at my torrent and it shows it isn't downloaded even though the file is here, might be something weird might not, I will update when I figure out what may be going on.  Not like TVTeam to mess up so maybe my VLC is picking a file to play instead of this one..."
,AlyH,2013-05-16T03:17Z,"OK disregard my previous - for some reason it brought up storage wars when it didn't find the fully downloaded this torrent...

I didn't notice until I went to re-download, sorry for the confusion!"
