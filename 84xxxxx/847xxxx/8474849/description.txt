Plot: Herbert & Henry (Jerod and Jamal Mixon) are twin brothers with dreams to become the biggest rap stars in the game. Their chance at super-stardom comes after they buy a T-shirt with a winning golden tag allowing them to perform with Real Deal, the most legendary rapper in the World. The only problem is, Kevin, an equally sized Jewish kid with dreams of singing and blinging, manages to steal the prized White T and has his own plans to perform at the concert. With the help of a gypsy, a goat, and cast of characters as big as Herbert and Henryâ™s appetites, White T is a feel good urban adventure reminiscent of Dude Whereâ™s My Car, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
