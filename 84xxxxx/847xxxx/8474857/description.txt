The BBC has adapted this classic Ealing comedy film several times, this production featuring Harry Enfield in the parts of the D Ascoigne family.

For those not familiar with the story, Louis Mazzini's mother was the sister of the Duke of Chalfont, but was cut off when she eloped with an Italian opera singer. Louis is brought up in genteel poverty, but decides to take his revenge by killing off all the members of the D Ascoigne family. Perhaps one day, he could become Duke of Chalfont.....??

A darkly comic tale, but one which was best served by the original film.
