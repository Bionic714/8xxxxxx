Loaded, first published in 1994, 
is a British magazine for men that is considered
to be the "original lads' mag". 
Its motto is "For men who should know better". 
At its peak in the late 1990s it sold over 450,000 copies
each month, but by 2012 had collapsed to below 35,000.
Between 2003-2006, Loaded won numerous industry awards
for design and journalism, including 'best designed fashion pages'
at the Magazine Design Awards, for a spread of dogs 
photographed wearing jewellery. Loaded staff writer 
Jeff Maysh won five industry awards for journalism,
including MJA Feature Writer of the Year, and PTC New Monthly 
Consumer Journalist of the year.
