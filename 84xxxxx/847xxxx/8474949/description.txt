The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is a 1984 concept album and the first solo album by ex-Pink Floyd English musician Roger Waters. The album was certified gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 1995.
The concept, as envisioned by Waters in 1977, rotated around a man's scattered thoughts during a road trip through somewhere in Central Europe, focusing on his midlife crisis, and how he dreams of committing adultery with a hitchhiker he picks up along the way. Along the way he also faces other fears and paranoia, with all of these things taking place in real time in the early morning hours of 04:30:18 AM to 05:12 AM on an unspecified day.
