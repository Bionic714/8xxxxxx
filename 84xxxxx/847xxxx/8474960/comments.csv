[T],Hard2Find2,2013-05-17T07:50Z,"@alveolate Well 1st off you clearly have this torrent and maximersk's completely confused. This torrent is twice the size of his. He Re-Encodes the files to a smaller size, and while it is still great quality after doing so (I also have some of his encodes) these untouched TV Rips are better looking in my opinion. So it is a matter of quality and file size. Different strokes for different folks. It's good to have options."
