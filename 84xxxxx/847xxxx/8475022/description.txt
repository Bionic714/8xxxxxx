There are three simple stages to achieving goals: 1. set the goal 2. create a sequence of steps for achieving it 3. monitor progress and make adjustments Easy. In theory. So why do some people consistently beat goals - and become serial success stories - whereras others find it much more difficult and tend to stumble every time? The answer is not in the goal setting, but that some of us fall over hurdles that we place before ourselves. These mental and emotional blocks act as self-sabotaging strategies.
