Note: This is the REAL episode - not the incorrect one that's been circulating the torrent sites. :)


Operation Repo S11E01 "Lou's Big Gamble" (Aired March 27th 2013)

It's a brand new start for the Operation Repo team when Lou bets big on a high-risk opportunity and sets up shop in Las Vegas! But when a live tiger stands between the team and a truck it seems like Vegas is more than they can handle. If they complete their mission, the payout could be enormous, but will they be able to resist the temptations of Sin City??

Note: Even though I said the previous ones would be my last uploads for these shows, I felt compelled to do this one anyway, since the copies that were made available on here were incorrect. I wanted to purchase it for myself anyway, so figured I might as well share it.
