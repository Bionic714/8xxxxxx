,natjo,2013-05-15T08:51Z,So let me ask something. I've never tried to download a FLAC ripped from vinyl. Can I tell that I'm listening to a vinyl record?
,woritstoh,2013-05-15T09:15Z,"@natjo
Not exactly like a vinyl. 24Bit/96KHz vinyl rips try to sound like a vinyl but most of them don't. Some of them manage in approaching vinyl warmth and precision, but still nothing sounds like a vinyl except... a vinyl."
[T],rjordan21,2013-05-15T13:04Z,"^^^ There is no substitute for listening to good vinyl directly from the source.  I think though that people associate ""good"" vinyl rips and bit length/sampling rate.  Just because an album was ripped to 24bit 96khz doesn't repair any issues the equipment/set up may have.  It's all about the source.  Here I have no idea what equipment was used."

I'm curious who appointed you the vinyl critic of TPB and why you feel the need to put your two cents in on every vinyl upload.  Uploaders share torrents, if you like them, you might download them. 

Otherwise it is none of your business what people upload and why and your constant chirping is irrelevant."
,Vauveli,2013-05-15T15:21Z,how can you have a vinyl of this already when the album hasn't even been released yet?. 
,Vauveli,2013-05-15T15:23Z,How can you have a vinyl of this album when it hasn't even been released yet?
[T],rjordan21,2013-05-15T15:27Z,"^^^ ummm I'm curious as to why you even care what I say?  I don't, ""put my two cents in"" on every vinyl upload.... take it easy and stop being so sensitive."
,tightbutthole,2013-05-15T22:27Z,"DAMN what a different sound, they've really changed..

,tahaa7,2013-05-16T11:03Z,Thank you! Fantastic dynamic range on this vinyl version! It's a pity the CD or iTunes versions don't have the same DR...
,kotzwuerg,2013-05-17T22:13Z,incredible vinyl rip. If you did this yourself: congratulations and thank you :)
,zep69,2013-05-18T00:47Z,What an outstanding torrent. Thank you so much! I've been waiting for this release for ages now. And to @tightbutthole yes you have to convert it to listen to it in itunes and upload it to an ipod.
