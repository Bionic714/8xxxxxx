It's in English; if you downloaded another version, don't bitch about here."
,Crapautard,2013-05-17T13:20Z,"Works great, some bug at the title screen, voice in English or Russian but you can use other languages for subtitles, otherwise if you choose another voice language game crash.
Beginning of the game is a bit laggy but outdoor gameplay works fine.

,treedude,2013-05-18T03:06Z,"This upload does not work, the installer jumps to and freezes at 27.2%.

It is sad because alot of their other releases have worked.

These douchebags won't release their encryption passwords for the bins so you can't even troubleshoot extraction errors inside of FreeArc.

BTW Error is not a valid SREP compressed file.

Not enough memory -5.

I have the installer directly at C: and am installing directly at C:

I have an SSD and a 7970 so stfu you fan boys"

,Silynt,2013-05-27T04:31Z,where can i find the patches that work with this repack?
,slimy_lurker,2013-06-03T09:32Z,"Everyone who has the ""Not a valid SREP compressed file"" error, open your torrent client & the folder where the files are being downloaded to. Remove all part files that might have been leftover. Go to the torrent client and check if you have skipped any files, if you have, set their priority to normal so that they download. Then do a force re-check on the torrent. Should find whatever parts are missing & finish downloading them. Before launching setup.exe, close all AV programs. Worked for me :)"
,TheMooshe,2013-06-09T08:59Z,"I have the same problem, stuck at 27.2% (SREP error) what's the solution? I've no antivirus installed, I'm installing on C:MLL. Torrent uploader, please help!"
