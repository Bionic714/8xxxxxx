Spirited Away - Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi

Since I couldn't find this video in HD with English Audio, I decided to dub the audio over the HD Japanese version of this.  This one was a little tricky, since the HD Japanese version had ad overlays and fade-outs.  I had to remove these and splice in some standard def to get everything to look correct, then dub over with English.  Don't worry - over 99% High Def - you won't be disappointed!  I couldn't wait any longer for an English release, and I'm sharing the dub with everyone!

And remember, there are already great quality HD versions out there without Eng, so please don't complain that that there are no subs or that this is in english - that was the whole point! :)

I'll seed as long as I can, but I'm going to ask others seed because I may not be able to keep seeding forever.
