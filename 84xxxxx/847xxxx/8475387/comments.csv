,trace535,2013-05-15T07:23Z,Drarbg is always first!
,CoBrit,2013-05-15T07:40Z,Appreciated. But a question. Why is the Daily Show & Colbert getting uploaded later & later every week. I do lack basic patience. LOL.
,BoonesFerry,2013-05-15T09:43Z,"
because capping and torrenting is not a paid job.
because cappers and torrent groups are not on a rigid schedule
because cappers and torrent groups have lives.
Oops, the doorbell rang and someone dropped by so I'll have to cap later. Ooop, my real job changed my work scheule. Ooops, I started dating someone new and now I'm busy. Ooops, I'm busy doing ten other more improtant shows tonight. 
Who knows, it could be almost anything.
Lower your unrealistic expectation and you wont be let down. lol. 

:P
