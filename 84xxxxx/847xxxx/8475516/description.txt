-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mathematical Applications for the Management, Life, and Social Sciences, 9th Edition is intended for a two-semester applied calculus or combined finite mathematics and applied calculus course. The book's concept-based approach, multiple presentation methods, and interesting and relevant applications keep students who typically take the course--business, economics, life sciences, and social sciences majors--engaged in the material.

This edition broadens the book's real-life context by adding a number of environmental science and economic applications. The use of modeling has been expanded, with modeling problems now clearly labeled in the examples. Also included in the Ninth Edition is a brief review of algebra to prepare students with different backgrounds for the material in later chapters.
