So, finally, ArmA 2 for Mac! Tested on Snow Leopard (10.6). 

Remember though, this is the FREE version of ArmA 2, not the paid version... :3. 

Yes, i did take the base port from Dan but then modify it a bit :). So i'm still gonna give Dan some credit! :D. Also, Dan had nothing to do with this actual torrent, only me, XxLAZERZWillxX :3. 


Remember though! This is 1.0, and has lotsa, lotsa lag, and other issuesΓÇª 


My comment on Dan's port if you wanna know about the performance etc.: 

"Works with the free version now after clearing out ALL the other DLC files etc.!

Playing the game on these settings:

Textures: Normal

AF: Very High

AA: Are you kidding me? Of course not! Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaags...

Terrain Detail: Very Low

Object Detail: Very Low

Shadows: Disabled

Post Processing Effects: Very High

And i think those are all the settings? :3.

And all of this is APPARENTLY Very High? I guess because of the amounts of "Very High"'s i put in there .┬á┬á

But, the resolution, oh god...

I have to play on 640x480, to get "better than horrible" FPS! 

But ah well, my specs suck after all so, i did expect that.

Have a few issues though that you did mention, like weird Shadows etc. But i also have a weird issue sometimes when changing resolutions, that everything just all of a sudden is zoomed in? 

Oh yeah, right, my specs... :3.

My System Specs:
- OS: Mac OS X 10.6.8
- CPU: 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
- RAM: 2 GB
- Video:┬á┬á Nvidia GeForce 9400 256 MB

ΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿Get about 5-15 FPS :l. ΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿But nevertheless, you did something others couldn't achieve... ΓÇ¿ΓÇ¿You ported ArmA 2... Great work bro."
