Among the sleep is an independent game by Krillbite Studio. In the game you play the role of a 2 year old boy who is awaken in the middle of the night and leaves his crib to find his parents. But with only his teddy bear as his companion strange things start to happen when a child's imagination and reality begin to blur.

This game is not complete as it is only an early alpha. But it is amazing and if you guys like it support it.
