,Mothra67,2013-05-15T11:45Z,"Thanks! can you beleive it? 21 leechers already!  That's why I took it down last time, in 2 days over 100 leechers and no one wanted to seed but you and me!  lolol"
,BrezNJ,2013-05-15T12:11Z,"Thanks, Mothra. I'm enjoying these Golden Age postings."
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-15T13:38Z,"...It's up to 26 at this point. But there's 10 seeders at the same time, which is a bit better than the last few postings of yours. The upside, of course, is that there are people out there who're interested in the GA classics besides ourselves. In this era where kids are brought up to think that Bendis, Millar and whatever efrit has possessed Mark Waid are examples of good writing, it's heartening to see youngsters taking an interest in the classics, even the obscure ones.

Unless, of course, all 26 leechers are over the age ot 40, then they're all just a bunch of nostalgic fracktards like us...) :) :)
"
,Mothra67,2013-05-15T17:50Z,"LOL so true, as I am one of those over 40 nostalgic ones!   On a side note, in a day or so I will be putting up the original Golden Age Green Lantern run from from DC so keep a watch out for it!"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-15T17:50Z,"...Otay, everything above is now being seeded by me, and will remain available for the next 7 days, barring any system downtime. Again, if any of you can, please also seed for at least 48 hours to help speed things up for everyone.

Thanks again to Mothra for the latest round of GA Classics. Stay tuned for his next greatest find, a copy of Whiz Comics #1, featuring Captain Thunder!



[Watches the youngsters go ""WTF??""] :)"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-15T18:01Z,"...Ah yesssss! The original GL run was always one of my favs, and I even have a few of the last issues in my long boxes that I picked up at an estate sale for next to nothing. Almost hated to take the guy's money, but he was so adamant that his pop's ""worthless funny books"" be removed from the property that he probably would have paid *me* to take them off his hands. Apparently the old guy spent the last few years - and a lot of the kids' inheritance - on collecting comics for investment, and the bottom dropped out of the market in the 90s thanks to Marvel's foil cover crap. Got a few Flash - including the last three issues before the end of the GA run - a bunch of Wayne Boring Superman issues, a couple of More Fun Comics in so-so shape - the scans online are near-mint compared to these - and about 3 dozen other National/DC late GA/early SA books. No Batman books, oddly enough, and no books from other publishers. Still, the GA GL stories were always fun reads, even when they brought in Doiby Dickles when the ""stoogekicks"" were the craze.

...Hey, while we're bouncing around requests, I've got a rather specific one that's not GA for you, Mothra. You got any 60s Gold Key books? I'm looking for the adaptation of ""Fantastic Voyage"", the one with Wally Wood art. It was one of the first comics I bought when we first moved to where I live these days, and it also has an alternate ending that was taken from a late-draft script that wasn't filmed that I might try to get added to the Wikipedia article. Would be good to have the indicia info to add as a footnote  just to appease the catamites who scream for ""citation requested"" just because they're too lazy to look things up themselves :P

If anyone else has this, feel free to wade on in, the water ain't deep :)"
,marvelnerd76,2013-05-15T21:36Z,Thanks Mothra67!
,Mothra67,2013-05-16T06:23Z,"I don't have those gold Keys, the only ones I found so far are the Star Treks and the UFOs, but I will search for you!"
,aeonwing,2013-05-16T08:37Z,"Thank you very much, I have been stuck at 98.6 forever! And thanks for all the GA stuff, the mind reels! "
,estetheo,2013-05-18T03:44Z,Many Thanks!!!!!!
,Mothra67,2013-05-20T01:04Z,"sorry guys, but as of this typing, I will no longer be seeding this Upload.  Why? 2 reasons: first my share ratio on this is well over 24, meaning over 20 gigs of this file have been upload, meaning everyone should have their fair share.  Second, my limited Bandwidth cannot keep supporting it as I put new UL's here on TPB

Thanks for understanding and enjoying this torrent so much"
