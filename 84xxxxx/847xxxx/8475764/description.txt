Singer, songwriter and filmmaker Seth Swirsky
began asking people to tell him their
stories of the Beatles in 2004

The results will be delivered to Blu-ray
in a documentary simply titled Beatles Stories!

Brian Wilson, Graham Nash, Art Garfunkel and
Henry Winkler are just some of the characters
he tracked down to share their anecdotes

In a clip at RollingStone.com, Nash talks about
being on hand for the first televised broadcast
of All You Need is Love'

He says he was invited at the last moment, and
the entire production had a charming looseness
to it, plus everyone was there

Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, Keith Richards and
more joined the Beatles for the 1967 broadcast
which turned into a party

Any excuse to have a party in the Sixties was
taken at the drop of a hat, Nash says

The collection of stories is being released by
the Beatles to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of their first single Love Me Do'
Swirsky has written songs like
Tell It to My Heart' by Taylor Dayne,
Instant Pleasure' by Rufus Wainwright and
Did You Give Enough Love' by Celine Dion

He's also published three books of letters
from baseball players and fans.

The New Yorker began a career after
Dartmouth College by writing jingles for
commercials, like the Thomas's English
Muffins jingle

Beatles Stories debuted at theaters in 2011
