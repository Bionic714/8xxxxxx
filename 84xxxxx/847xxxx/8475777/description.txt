We Are Modeselektor

Documentary following the German
Electronic band comprised of
Gernot Bronsert and Sebastian Szary
on tour in 2012 As well as showing
the duo playing gigs at locations
including Poland's Audio River Festival
and the Roskilde Festival in Denmark
the film reflects on the pairing's
history and recalls their early DIY days

The search for the origin of this
phenomenon leads us into the depths
of the biographies of two kids born
and raised in East Germany
whose creativity enthusiasm and
idea of a collective brought them
from the Berlin suburbs to the
city itself and the stages of the world.

To consistently retrace this path
the documentary offers a rich variety
of archive material extensive behind
the scenes tour footage and the
travels to important places of
the past and present.

As a result there are very private
insights into Sebastian Szary's and
Gernot Bronsert's life as subversive
artists who are despite their broad
success authentic and who over
the years stayed true to where
they came from.
