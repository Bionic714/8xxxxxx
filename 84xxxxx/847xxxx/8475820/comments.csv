What virus did you find? Are you even sure? Try verifying the hashes and the certificates and stuff with the ones from adobe. They are the original ones from adobe.  
I uploaded these because some don't know where to get offline installers, some countries blocked adobe, some can't download from adobe directly (downloads get interrupted/cancelled) and many other reasons. So don't just put false allegations."
