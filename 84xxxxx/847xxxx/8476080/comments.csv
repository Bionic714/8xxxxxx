Very large file, I know that updates are included, thanks. 

Nice of you to notify us that it will not fit on a 4.37GB DVD, I would never have figured that out."
[H],Devastat0r36,2013-05-15T14:21Z,Awesome ;)
,atf_Mart,2013-05-15T17:51Z,"I installed Feb 2013, whats the difference between this one? only the windows updates? Can I get them from Windows Update? Or should I just reinstall this."
,vwking,2013-05-15T18:52Z,"@murphy, I have a question: if I install office 2013 VL on it will be automatic activated with KMS scheluder? or I must use any KMSPico/Nano/toolkit?"
,Accolon9,2013-05-15T19:32Z,"Although I use your n/1 releases, but nevertheless, again you are the One (best W+Office releaser): THANKS!!!

[V],murphy78,2013-05-16T00:04Z,"atf, you can download them from Windows Update.
The main differences lately in the pro vl releases have been the included updates and the methodology of the activation index."
,Sonic_27,2013-05-16T03:50Z,"Been waiting for this...PERFECT, THANKS AGAIN my friend =)"
,nj98110,2013-05-16T09:56Z,Many thanks for this. Windows 7 with may updates coming next?
,Shah_Jahan,2013-05-16T16:17Z,"Thanks, but since this one already needed a dual-layer DVD, why not include Office 2013 x64 too with it?!

And you mentioned that *NO* unattended settings were added? Why not make it unattended and auto-crack the windows (and office, if you wish to add it)

Since this is NOT an untouched release, why not touch it a little more to perfection?!"
,simiromba,2013-05-16T17:16Z,DISAGREE THE PERSON ABOVE! CONTINUE THIS SO FINE! CAN BE SURE THAT WOULD mess! WE MAY NOT REQUIRE A LOT!
,UraharaZR,2013-05-16T17:41Z,"It works great, no complaints, and looks awesome.

BUT!

It says its not verified - what to do?"
[V],murphy78,2013-05-17T03:15Z,"shah that's not what an unattended file does. What an unattended file does is automate the setup CHOICES. It does nothing for the setup installed files.

I've already automated the activation in the KMS-Activated index. I leave the other one for people who don't wish to use KMS Server Service.

As for the Office requests... I'm already working on some re-issues of the +office2013 versions. Most notably I'm starting a new series, Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 + Office 2013.

I'm working on that now. I plan on doing a plain-jane win7ultsp1 after that, then win8+office re-visited versions of enterprise+office.

Once all that is behind me I'll do the AIO versions. I really try to make sure that every single thing I can think of has been working flawlessly before doing AIO versions as they take much more time to integrate and test.

Anyway... gotta get back to it..."
,simiromba,2013-05-17T05:18Z,"I have a doubt murphy78 wonder if after the installation I need to do some kind of activation?


Estou com uma duvida murphy78 gostaria de saber se após a instalaçao eu preciso fazer algum tipo de ativação?"
,Quronja,2013-05-17T07:41Z,After installing Windows is activated or not?????
[V],murphy78,2013-05-17T11:55Z,"It's very simple. The normal index is not activated. The KMS-Activated index IS activated. Seriously, use your brains people."
,Qurajber,2013-05-17T16:11Z,Activation of 6 months!
,foRceHeLo,2013-05-18T18:36Z,Everything installed and works perfectly with the exception of IE 10. It will only open full screen in the start screen but if I try to open from the Desktop (window mode) it will try to open and then crash and close. Anyone else notice this? I've tried uninstalling and re-installing with no luck.
[V],murphy78,2013-05-19T09:00Z,forcehelo that happens when  your video drivers are being updated and you don't reboot...
[V],murphy78,2013-05-19T09:00Z,"quraj, it's 6 months at a time, but it will auto-renew itself every 7 days.... you'll never get to 0."
,shotmaniac,2013-05-20T03:01Z,How do i get my WMC key working back?
,Qurajber,2013-05-20T08:53Z,Thanks man....
,crews_control93,2013-05-20T12:42Z,Okay maybe I am missing something but I have installed and It(Windows 8 Pro x64) is up and running.  But it will not activate.  How do i activate this? 
,crews_control93,2013-05-20T12:48Z,Basically what I'm asking is if I have already installed the regular one is there a way to get it get the KMS one without having to do a full install and stuff.
,shotmaniac,2013-05-21T14:36Z,"to install the wmc key i need to install the retail version of windows?


crews_control93 I think is the same KMS used in MKT: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8322107/Microsoft_Toolkit_2.4.3_Official_Torrent"
,2ubu2,2013-05-21T19:56Z,Many thanks. Have not tested yet but have used many of your ul's and trust this one is just as good. 
,rehansiddiq,2013-05-25T11:38Z,"thanks dear   ;)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,XxSCExX,2013-05-27T08:33Z,"Thanks for all the hard work you've put into this! 

Just one question before I install, will all my programs from Windows 7 transfer over or should I run a dual boot? 

If I should dual boot, will creating an extra partition and installing Windows 8 as a ""Custom Install"" on to the new partition work or does the install not support that?"
,brianxxx,2013-05-27T16:18Z,"Great work as always!

I cannot believe you actually have to even type this in the description 
""This will NOT fit on a 4.37GiB Single-Layer DVDR
Use a Dual-Layer DVDR or an 8GB+ USB flash drive"" !!!!!!!!!!! LOL

Always a few out there huh?! lol"
,XxSCExX,2013-05-28T03:49Z,"Ok so I dual-booted this on a VHD. It's working fine but they a picture with a key that says ""Activate Windows - Go to PC settings to activate Windows.""

I know you said it uses two file systems, but is this watermark supposed to be in the bottom right corner like it is?"
,Link10101,2013-06-01T04:56Z,Can you update this?
,aditya009,2013-06-02T18:03Z,"I've installed this particular version of windows 8 more than 11 times on my new PC in the last 6 days & the max i've been able to get from it is a brief span of 21 hrs of windows 8 experience for one fortunate install only.... loss of essential drivers, inability to access the file systems, unexplained crashes.. and more..
So what i really wanna ask is that am i the only one who's experiencing these problems?? and is there a possible solution to my troubles??

I have an i7-3770k processor with 16 gb 1600mhz corsair ram...
Also i use a usb to install..
Please help me for i'm totally lost.."
,dulcem.armoniam,2013-06-04T15:54Z,Thanks bro. I am using it now. I was able to install it with no problems. Will be informing you if any issue comes up.
,donut13th,2013-06-04T20:26Z,"@murphy78
I would really aprecieaty if you would find a momment to reply. Before installing your version of windows8 i'd like to know few things. First of all, do i install it as normally as windows 7, without typing any keys etc, and after reboot it will be a normal, activated version of windows 8? Also, should i turn off Windows Updates through services.msc, or i can calmly connect to official windows update servers? Another thing, i heard in windows 8 you can personalize your start desktop (or however its called - these bricks), do i need to somehow connect to my hotmail.com (=microsoft) account or something like that? If yes, should i sign up for everything what windows wants?
Thanks for answers, from anyone. And sorry for my english.
PS. Thanks for torrent anyway;)"
