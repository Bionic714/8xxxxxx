TSR 1980 edition Deities and Demigods

Yes, it's the one that has the Cthulu, Melnibonean and Nehwon Mythos


NOTE: This is not a great scan. I grabbed this out of a massive download elsewhere on this site and figured other people might be interested in just this file. It is not my pdf and yes, it's got a bunch of odd text/font stuff going on. I'd clean it up if I knew how. Sorry!
