This collection contains most of the Borges - di Giovanni collaborative translation/updates (they translated the original Spanish but also changed things - deleted paragraphs, added new ones, etc.) to many of his stories, as well as Borges' complete stories in the terrible Hurley translation (for reference I guess). I also added an excellent book by di Giovanni about Borges. 

These are the included volumes:
The Aleph and Other Stories (Dutton)
The Book of Sand (Dutton)
Six Problems for Don Isidro Parodi (Dutton)
