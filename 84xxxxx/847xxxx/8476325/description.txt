(I want to beware sensible and vulnerable people about russian video: at the ~1/4 of the russian video there is very ugly picture added by russian translators (in original english video there is not any additional pictures), which appears for a few seconds. I don't know how to edit the video. Sorry about this.)

If you want to make our world a better place to live, then, please, pay your attention to book "Summerhill - A Radical Approach To Child Rearing" written by Alexander Sutherland Neill (or - A. S. Neill). This book may inspire you and change your worldview same as with Jacque Fresco. This book was written near ~1960th, and it is already translated at least to dozen of languages.
At least the English, Russian, Hindi, Polish, Marathi texts of this book you may find here:
