If it's a new recording just gimme some 24/96 masters. If I like it I will buy the vinyl myself."

,anonabyss,2013-05-17T22:28Z,"I'm a musician with perfect pitch and pretty superb hifi equipment and I will tell you, anyone who claims they can tell the difference between 16/44 and 24/96 is full of shit. I guarantee if you do a double blind study the results will be 50/50 because the human ear is simply not capable of distinguishing between sounds that accurately. It's the same reason I think vinyl is a complete waste of time to begin with, but I guess that's personal preference as some people like the noisy muffled ""warm"" sound of vinyl for some reason.

Also, you titled this torrent wrong. Only way I was able to find this torrent was by leaving out ""memories"" in my query."
,Meremoth,2013-05-20T00:33Z,"Why are they labeled mp3 if they're FLAC?

As far as the whole 16/44 vs. 24/96 thing, you really need good headphones, amp, and DAC to take advantage of that type of hi-fi.  Most people just use crappy headphones with on-board sound, with no amp or DAC.  

Of course there are some frequencies humans can't hear, but that doesn't change the fact that the frequencies we can't hear can change how we perceive the frequencies that are audible.  

Either way, lossless is the only way to go, because even with shitty headphones & a shitty source, I can tell the difference between lossy and lossless.  "
,Meremoth,2013-05-20T01:17Z,"Also I assume some people who download 24/96 music don't actually go into their soundcard or DAC, and music player properties/manager and actually change their format to match their music, so their music is being down-sampled.  "
,bunderson,2013-05-20T22:11Z,@anonabyss for someone who claims to be a musician and cannot tell the difference between twice or half the music quality is in the wrong game pal. You're in the wrong category - maybe the mp3 files are more suited to you. Or maybe a decent hifi system and some ear wax drops will do the trick bang on. 
,bunderson,2013-05-20T22:14Z,"Thanks bubanee, although Jeep is right - a 24/96 would be much more useful. Even though generally people who claim to be ""audiophiles"" are not. "
,futureshock999,2013-05-23T18:55Z,"@bunderson: their is no linear correlation between sample rate, bit depth, and perceived quality.  There IS a correlation, but it is probably logarithmic.  So saying double this and double that are twice the quality is simply a falsehood.  The transducer has an upper limit to IT'S conformity to the waveform, and acts as a low-pass filter, with resonance.  You can buy the best speakers on earth, and they will still do the same, just ever so closer...but they can never achieve perfect."
,bunderson,2013-05-24T00:34Z,"@futureshock999 do some research. I spend most of my life in recording studios and know for a fact that when you downsample from ANY bit rate/khz, you dither to introduce noise to fill in the gaps. Surely you can't dispute this? When you have spent days if not weeks listening to studio master files then hear the same track halved in bit depth and sample rate, the effect smacks you like a brick in the face. "
