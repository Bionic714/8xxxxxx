,tpb2009Nov13jb,2013-05-16T00:07Z,"Thanks, but how do I turn off CHECK FOR UPDATES? There used to be a settings option in older versions but now I can't find it. It seems to check for updates automatically and then, if denied permission via firewall, requires switching HD Decrypter mode. "
,greyaburton,2013-05-16T21:02Z,"@tpb.. did you leave the old version installed?my new version doesn't check for updates and Ive noticed that sometimes if you adjust the settings in an old version(the latest 8 one)and leave that one on your computer then install the new 9 one,the settings are automatically applied to that one.?could give it a try if you have removed the old one.hope it works for you.have a good one."

,tpb2009Nov13jb,2013-05-20T09:34Z,"Thanks for the feedback. I don't want to belabor the point, but... Yes, I uninstalled all former versions first with revouninstaller. 

After installation of this 9-series version, I blocked it with a firewall. It asked for an update check iirc and wanted internet access, which I refused. Under those conditions it would only run in HD Decrypter mode. Actually HD Decrypter mode worked fine for me to copy the Jack Reacher movie, which is the only reason I had upgraded from the 8-series version.

Experimenting, I then let it have internet access (contact its server) and it seemed to go into normal DVDFab mode after a couple of restarts. It made no further mention of an update check. I haven't had a chance to test it in this mode."
,greyaburton,2013-05-22T21:14Z,"@tpb you dont have to uninstall the old ones.i still have version 3,8,and 9 on mine.they run independently of each other,and when installing a new 9 version(they have a new beta version out now 9041 and this patch works with that one also!),it just over writes the old one.just at the last window,dont have to put shortcut on desktop or qiuck launch again when asked,the old shortcut will run the new one.have a good one"
,tpb2009Nov13jb,2013-05-23T15:24Z,"Traditionally it has been necessary to uninstall the former version(s) of DVDFab, clean the computer system (or use something like revouninstalelr), block access with a firewall, install the new version, and then change the settings to stop it from checking for updates. Else it checked for updates, saw that you were running a craaked version, and automatically downgraded to HD Decrypter. I suppose that procedure may no longer be necessary with the latest 9-series versions, but I haven't had a chance to test it. I only use DVDFab rarely so am not an expert."
