A DVD-ripped version of the lost Intervention episode "Gabe and Vanessa," the second episode of the first season. My first torrent ever! Sorry if it blows.

Gabe has a severe gambling addiction and is a total dick. He, like, made his parents sell their home to use the money for gambling.
Vanessa is a shopaholic (which should not be a word; rather, she has a shopping addiction), but the REAL story is that she was an original character on ER until her OCD/ADHD/Anxiety/Agoraphobia/Allergies caused her to take a mental leave from the show. Her voice is quite annoying, but I really feel for her.
