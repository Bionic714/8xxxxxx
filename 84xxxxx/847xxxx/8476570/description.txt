A small game I made in C++ as an exercise in a physicists' basic programming class.

Plus the source code.

"The goal of this game is to 'shoot' as close to the center of the target as
 you can. You 'shoot' at the position of your cursor (the * symbol) by
 pressing the spacebar. The cursor will be speeding up on its own, but you can
 change its speed too, by pressing buttons."
