Wednesday 05-15-2013: Alan Johnson MP - UK Home Secretary 2009 - 2010

Stephen Sackur speaks to Alan Johnson, who held a series of cabinet posts in the last Labour Government. He's that rare breed, a politician who grew up in poverty and worked his way up from the bottom. Has today's professionalised class of politicians lost touch with real life?
