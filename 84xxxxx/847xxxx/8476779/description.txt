author: SSR 

The Michigan boys return with their third studio effort, 
ΓÇ£OnyxΓÇ£. The quintetΓÇÖs third album, ΓÇ£War of AngelsΓÇ¥ was the best hard rock album of 2011. It was instantly addictive and full of memorable tracks. The first single off this one, ΓÇ£TrenchesΓÇ¥ seems to pick up where the last record left off. So when Pop Evil frontman Leigh Kakaty said the new album ΓÇ£absolutely destroysΓÇ¥ the last one and called it ΓÇ£a statement album,ΓÇ¥ well I was pretty excited.
