Perspective Sketching 1: The Basics

Understanding form, space, and structure will dramatically improve your drawing ability.  "Linear Perspective" is the key to these aspects of drawing, and is often avoided by beginners.   This series offers an alternative approach to perspective: freehand sketching with a grid.  

Whether you've been avoiding perspective or simply want to learn a different approach, this series explains the basic guidelines: viewpoint, creating basic shapes, simple sculpting, and measuring in perspective.  Though these skills aren't flashy or impressive, they're absolutely essential for good drawing.  Once you can reproduce the techniques in these videos, even your most basic doodles will have a stronger sense of form and volume.

Perspective Sketching 2: Form and Design

Do you already know the general rules of perspective sketching?  This followup to Perspective Sketching 1 applies the basic principles to a wide variety of subjects.  Packed with examples, the videos explore characters, creatures, vehicles, and environments (both from reference and from imagination).  Each demonstration focuses on the underlying structure of imagined objects, and how details can be applied to this foundation.  Additionally, the demonstrations each follow slightly different procedures - showing that there is no single 'best' way to use perspective in your artwork.  

If you've ever wondered about how to actually use the rules of perspective in your drawings, this series is for you.  

Note:  This series exclusively focuses on workflow and theory - it does not recap the basic rules found in Perspective Sketching 1.
