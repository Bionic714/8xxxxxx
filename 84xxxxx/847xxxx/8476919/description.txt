The Great Jazz Trio - 2002 - Autumn Leaves

The Great Jazz Trio was a working cooperative working with various lineups led by Hank Jones in during the 1970s and 1980s, but the revival of this defunct group finds Jones joined by two newcomers to the group, seasoned veterans Richard Davis on bass and the leader's brother, Elvin Jones, on drums. Oddly enough, the two brothers have recorded together very infrequently during their long careers, so this opportunity must have been special to them. The opening track signals a different direction for the group, with Elvin's explosive solo stealing the show in "Autumn Leaves." The pianist's imaginative arrangement of "Yesterdays" begins as a stunning solo before Davis' sparse bass and Elvin's brushes join him. The buoyant treatment of Kenny Dorham's "Blue Bossa" finds Hank in a humorous mood, inserting several brief quotes from well-known works such as "Hot House" and "Blue Skies." The trio is clearly cooking by the time it recorded the percolating take of Oliver Nelson's "Six and Four." Hopefully, this delightful date by The Great Jazz Trio will result in a follow-up recording session. (AllMusic)
