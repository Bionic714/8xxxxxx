The Great Jazz Trio - 2004 - Collaboration

Collaboration is the third CD to be issued from a pair of 2002 sessions by the Great Jazz Trio, featuring Elvin Jones and Richard Davis with leader Hank Jones. The pianist previously worked alongside Davis on numerous sessions led by other musicians, including Elvin's Dear John C., though the Jones brothers worked together only sporadically during their long careers. Although eight of the songs appeared on Someday My Prince Will Come (issued by Eighty-Eights/Columbia) and the earlier 441 CD Autumn Leaves, these are valid alternate takes and not repeats or castoffs. Elvin Jones, who died in 2004 from heart problems, is still in top form on these sessions, especially on the thunderous opener, "Rhythm-a-Ning," though he focuses quite a bit on his underrated brushwork for the remainder of the disc. Davis shines in the spacious arrangement of "Summertime" and the jaunty treatment of "Satin Doll." The leader's brisk approach to "The Shadow of Your Smile" proves to be very refreshing, while his intricate arrangement of "Moose the Mooche" is especially subtle. The one solo track, an imaginative take of "Memories of You," was recorded by Hank in early 2004, just a few months prior to his younger brother's death. (AllMusic)
