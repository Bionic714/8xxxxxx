All apologies for the slow seeding, there is a very large bandwidth restriction on my end.  I will be splitting this torrent up into multiple torrents, one per album, in order to smooth the process.

I sincerely regret to announce that I will no longer seed this torrent, as I have split this torrent into several smaller, much more manageable torrents.  "
