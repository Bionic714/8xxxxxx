,onedrop75,2013-05-15T22:08Z,Thanks wush team for getting these on a little earlier. I work nights and I use to have to wait till the next day to d/l. Now I get them same day. Hope you keep it up but if not no biggie. Just glad to hear Howard whenever I can. Makes those 10 hours at work go alot faster

I no longer have to stop and fast forward to get back to the Stern Show"
,lky001,2013-05-24T05:03Z,"Hey, wush, is it the full version of the wrap-up show? They referred to it briefly on the actual show on 5/21/2013 and Howard said that he stopped playing it because of something that happened between Robin and Benjy on the air. It'd be nice if you could upload that original censored version?"
