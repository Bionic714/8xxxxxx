[T],GIANNIS511,2013-05-16T13:56Z,"Thanks for all the comments guys! I really appreciate them, although I rarely answer, due to my busy schedule and the fact that on Wednesdays I spend all my afternoon (In Greece the comics are uploaded after 4:30 pm) searching for comics. To the point now next week I will not be able to upload any comics, because I'll be taking for the third time panhellenic exams, so that I can be accepted in law school, and I won't have the time to upload or even read any comic. So see you in 13 days :)"

Just a question regarding Daredevil End of Days, you uploaded the first 7 issues and i was wondering if you were going to upload the 8th and final issue?

Cheers"
