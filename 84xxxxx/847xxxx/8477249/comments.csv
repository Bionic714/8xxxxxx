,Damfjell,2013-05-16T13:35Z,PS to be clear; this one does not include 'Inferno'. Thanks for the upload TxJag!
[T],TxJag,2013-05-16T19:49Z,It says 5 books and then I provided a link to Inferno. I'd hope people would catch on that Inferno isn't included since its already been uploaded beforehand.
,eheske,2013-05-17T18:25Z,Thanks Very Much!
,Talos63,2013-05-19T02:34Z,"Thank you very much for this. I own hard copies of all of Dan's books, but it is great to have digital copies as well. 
I personally feel that ebooks should be made available to book purchasers as part of the sale."
[T],TxJag,2013-05-19T16:31Z,@Talos63 I like that idea or just the eBook itself. I don't see paper publication going out soon but it could happen in the next 10 - 15 years.

i love every Dan Brown's novels, the way he tells the stories are so mind blowing, could you recommend me other authors similiar to Dan Brown?
I tried Steve Berry but, well... not ""Dan Brown"" enough, hahaha"
[T],TxJag,2013-06-05T18:28Z,"@boodee I prefer Steve Berry over Dan Brown lol. James Rollins is good, writes a lot of techno-thrillers. Just finished his first Sigma Force novel and loved it. His latest Sigma Force is released pretty soon."
