,EpicWin716153,2013-05-15T20:46Z,I think the reason you get 5-15 fps is because of your Nvidia graphics card it is a very bad one sorry to say and a built in 4000 intel is quite better according to some websites. Intel HD 4000 scores 472 in G3D Mark. Nvidia 9400m scores 147 in G3D Mark.
,EpicWin716153,2013-05-15T20:47Z,Also does this come with all the files like mpmissions and manual etc.?
,joni1999pop,2013-05-16T10:40Z,"can you upload Enviro-Bear 2000

,emokid117,2013-05-16T13:11Z,Any chance of upload Borderlands 2 from the app store?
,tobies,2013-05-16T16:44Z,Would it work with HD Graphics 3000?
,Kaien213,2013-05-16T19:41Z,Dont know why but its downloading kinda slow :/
,Kaien213,2013-05-16T20:43Z,"I downloaded it already, but.... I know I have ATI Radeon HD 4670 256MB but it shouldnt be running on like 0,5 FPS on low details dammit!"
,McDiezel,2013-05-18T03:22Z,"I really wanna play this game cause it's the only realistic shooter I've ever seen, but my old ass mac can't handle it, if someone could upload ARMA 1 they'd become the coolest person on earth"
,cybersosa,2013-05-18T19:50Z,"Download time was fine, but when it finished downloading and I tried to play it, it was stuck on the screen that says ""Bohemia Interactive."" 
I'm on 10.8.3"
,alternate_z11,2013-05-18T22:10Z,"I got it to work on 

Mac 2011, 13"", Intel HD 3000.

But framrates are EXTREMELY slow at the lowest possible settings. Yes, it's a working port, which is great, but I would not say it performs well enough to be played on midtier/low-end macs. Nevertheless, thank you, uploader. :)"
,Kaien213,2013-05-20T13:45Z,What the hell?! It works just fine of freaking virtual machine! But I cant play it on VM either.... Screen is slowly getting white till I cant see anything
,DMentMan,2013-05-29T21:02Z,"this did not work, fuck"
,DMentMan,2013-05-29T21:04Z,"now its working, kind of, lag"
