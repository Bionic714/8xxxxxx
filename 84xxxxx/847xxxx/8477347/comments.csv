,saifi2649,2013-05-16T10:53Z,@Krhth90 yeah root is required mate to install poweramp music player
,Krhth90,2013-05-17T07:45Z,"Yes but my root is on and I have full signal,and it says that I don't have!"
,saifi2649,2013-05-17T18:56Z,@Krhth90 use modded google play by chelpus instead of lucky patcher
,axzeds,2013-05-24T04:20Z,"The modded Google Play keeps telling me I do not have root access, but every other app tells me I do..ie ROM Tool Box, Quick Boot, SuperUser, Root checker basic, etc. I loaded power amp with the unlocker anyway, but I'm getting a validation warning."
,astigtochoy,2013-05-31T07:44Z,"Mate it sill better unrooted when using poweramp, after trial expires uninstall it clear ram cache anything, then install it again, there another 30 days what do u know"
,axzeds,2013-06-01T13:28Z,"Yeah, it still says I am not rooted, but taking astigtochoy's advice, I just will continue to run the trial and clear the cache and start over when my time expires...good call mate."
,hausek,2013-06-04T04:23Z,"Working good! Thanks! Just followed the tutorial on the older version torrent 

1.) Install Google Play Installer.apk
2.) Run ""Installer cracked GooglePlay"" and press ""Install and Reboot"".
3.) Enable Internet.
4.) Install Poweramp Full Version Unlocker v2-build-26.apk (Don't run it!)
5.) Install Poweramp-2.0.9-build-529.apk
6.) Run PowerAMP. Done."
