,gbmax,2013-05-15T23:30Z,seeding here ;)
,nbmatt,2013-05-16T01:23Z,"I'm not entirely sure why it's not showing any seeds/leeches, but it should be heavily seeded by now. At least according to my current ratio, haha.

,severedhand,2013-05-16T01:43Z,Thanks so much for this. It went quick for me. This album is fucking amazing.
,TheNexus18,2013-05-16T01:49Z,"Why the hell aren't there any seeders?!  This is Queens of the Stone Age, for Christ's sake people!  SEED!!"
,TheNexus18,2013-05-16T02:43Z,"...I take it back.  Holy shit.  It finished downloading in exactly one minute.  And here I thought there were no seeders.
Well played, seeders, well played...
Thanks a lot!"
,nbmatt,2013-05-16T05:52Z,@TheNexus18: I think the Bay gets their rocks off by fucking with people's torrent stats sometimes ahaha
,bronsongotn,2013-05-16T11:23Z,"Good speed with no seeders! :-D Thanks,good quality!"
,pinutu,2013-05-16T18:33Z,thanks 
,bloodnfeces,2013-05-16T18:53Z,Seeding here! thanks
,sam.may,2013-05-17T03:54Z,True bit rate is 128...
,nbmatt,2013-05-17T07:08Z,"@sam.may: Since you apparently have a copy of a higher bitrate, which is the only possible way you could know what the ""true bitrate"" of the files in this torrent are, you should go ahead and upload it.

But I can only assume you're filled to the brim with shit. If the torrent doesn't suit your sophisticated tastes my heart won't be broken and Earth will continue to orbit 'round the sun."
,Smoke_,2013-05-18T05:05Z,already have my Pre order coming. Deluxe edition vinyl 45 rpm with some book full of QOTSA shit. I will support this band and any band that kicks this much ass.
,Smoke_,2013-05-18T05:05Z,btw thank you very much for the upload 
,mannybob,2013-05-18T21:26Z,@nbmatt you can use spectral analysis to find the true bitrate of music. See: http://www.whatinterviewprep.com/prepare-for-the-interview/spectral-analysis/ for more info.
,alfie_fan,2013-05-19T05:15Z,"first time I've ever commented here... just to say, and assure, that I will be buying the album, shirts and any used rubbers of the band as they come available."
,HKCannibal,2013-05-24T22:40Z,Thanks!
,atthedrivein81,2013-05-29T22:34Z,I got your spectral analysis right here.  Thanks for the upload!  
,The_Dill,2013-06-02T22:02Z,"@sam.may @nbmatt @mannybob

Spectral analysis shows frequency cut-off at 19.5k, shelf at 16k. Signs point to V0 VBR.

Also, it sounds great to me. Is that beside the point?"
,Spongehammer,2013-06-03T17:38Z,"If the album is good, please buy it."
,Spongehammer,2013-06-03T20:58Z,Update: the album is O.K. :/
,Spongehammer,2013-06-03T21:47Z,"If anyone knows where I can get scans of the booklet, let me know, please; or if the album inlet doesn't supply lyrics, please tell me where I can get official lyrics at. Pretty. Please?"
,CaptBeefheart,2013-06-04T21:19Z,"@Spongehammer

Buddy, you're a hypocrite if I ever saw one.

Firstly, you remind people to support the artists.

Then, you ask where the free download for the ""album inlet"" is.

Get your shit together."

Greatest depths of a gut-laugh have been reached because of you, great one.

Keep giving to all of mankind.
