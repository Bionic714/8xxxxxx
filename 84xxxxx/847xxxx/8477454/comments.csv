,squash34,2013-05-16T17:10Z,can someone confirm whether co-op works (via hamachi)
,introver,2013-05-16T20:56Z,Can you actually play this over LAN? Like using tunggle or just opening the ports and having others enter the IP?
,Trixta024,2013-05-16T20:57Z,I don't see how to launch the game? I got it installed and the crack copied over but I see no way to launch the game
,Cerebral222,2013-05-17T04:54Z,"Thanks ez, nice upload, works well, cheers.
@Trix, installer should've created a shortcut, but if not use the ""SanctumGame-Win32-Shipping.exe"" in the : Program Files  Sanctum 2  Binaries  Win32 folder."
,tritiann,2013-05-17T10:20Z,"can we get the other new sanctum, 'super sanctum TD'?  it was a preorder bonus, and now its a retro style game based off sanctum =D  Thanks for all your uploads extremezone"

,Magicdito304,2013-05-17T22:16Z,It says my acces to Steam_api is denied! I can't do anything with it ! Help please !!
,One-Eyed_Woody,2013-05-20T02:54Z,Every time I launch the game it says no save file found. Anyone else having this problem?
,Captain_Planet,2013-05-23T03:21Z,"I have a problem.

I can't seem to install the game because the set up music is way too awesome and I can't seem to stop listening to it. Help."
,TimDaHacka,2013-05-27T22:15Z,THANKS EXTREMEZONE I JUST FINISHED INSTALLING IT AND PLAYING IT! IT IS SO FUN AND THANKS FOR FAST DOWNLOAD! ABOUT ALL THE GAMES YOU TORRENT ARE EPIC! THANKS MAN!
,cakeroach,2013-06-01T13:54Z,"Hello, is there a way to update the game to the latest version? there aren't any patches available for download anywhere. will there be a cracked patch at a later date or do we have to do it manually somehow? thanks.  "
