Screen icons Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck continue the fun in season two of
The Looney Tunes Show, a modern, animated half-hour comedy series. Living
together on a suburban cul-de-sac, our favorite mismatched roommates hit
the ground laughing, along with beloved Looney Tunes characters from the
first season, including Porky, Lola, Speedy, Tina and many more. This season,
find out what happens when Bugs becomes addicted to PorkyΓÇÖs buttery catering,
or when Gossamer turns into a frog after Lola mistakes the WitchΓÇÖs spell book
for a bedtime story. And can Daffy, Lola and Foghorn Leghorn help the town
find their holiday spirit during a Christmas heat wave? The fun continues in
the looniest neighborhood on television, along with all-new Merrie Melodies,
original songs and music videos featuring your favorite Looney Tunes characters.

Daffy takes piano lessons from Granny despite an inability to learn. As a result,
Bugs gets noise-cancelling earbuds and quickly realizes he can tune out everything,
from Daffy's terrible piano playing to boring conversations. Plus, in the Merrie
Melodies video "Daffy's Legacy", Daffy describes how he wants to be celebrated
after his eventual passing.
