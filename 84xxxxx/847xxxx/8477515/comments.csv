,kilmister666,2013-05-16T08:15Z,"Horrible sound, but looks like it's the whole book. Will wait for a book I can bear hearing, though."

,tj79tomtom,2013-05-17T12:29Z,Strange. On my computer its very good but on my smartphone its very noisy. All other audiobooks are ok though on both machines. Any ideas why this is?
,bobbyphoto2,2013-05-17T14:09Z,Probably my last update--The recording sounds fine on my computer and mp3 player.  I even made some CD's and they sound fine.  I guess you just have to try this on your system and see what happens.  Good luck.
