,pcbflare,2013-05-20T16:57Z,Anomaly2.exe ---> application failed to start 0x0142c error (or something like that)  
,Xaenor,2013-05-24T14:20Z,"pcbflare, sad as it is, the problem is in the crack. It will not work for Windows XP, and that's most likely the problem you're experiencing. I don't think anyone else made a different crack for the game, so XP users are out of luck."
,pcbflare,2013-05-31T15:03Z,"Xaenor: yep, find that out myself by trying pretty much everything possible. With Van Helsing it helped me to use older steam_api.dll, but no such luck with Anomaly 2. Well the migration to W7 starts to seem unavoidable... Holy shit i got SOOO much data to move."
