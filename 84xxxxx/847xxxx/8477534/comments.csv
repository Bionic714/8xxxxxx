,Pharmit24,2013-05-16T06:36Z,I hate how every torrent you upload that Guy Thumbs Up picture...Upload the Game picture in every torrent which is a game. -_-
,Fluid56,2013-05-16T17:18Z,"holy shit will you shut the fuck up about the included photo? 

stiffy's autobot does the torrent uploading, which is why it has the same photo for each one. 

shut the fuck up about the photo. it's fine. if you faggots want the game cover so bad go purchase the fucking game. beggars can't be choosers you insolent fucking twats."
