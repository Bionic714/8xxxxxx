Jackie McLean with The Great Jazz Trio - 1978 - New Wine in Old Bottles (2007)

It was an inspired idea to match alto saxophonist Jackie McLean with the Great Jazz Trio, a regularly working unit on record and in concert led by the outstanding pianist Hank Jones, joined by two first call players, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams. Although the word "again" is added to McLean's two originals, the barnburner "Appointment in Ghana" and "Little Melonae," they aren't very different from earlier recordings in concept. McLean also shines in ballad settings of "It Never Entered My Mind" and "'Round Midnight." Jones' advanced playing may be a eye-opener for some fans who do not realize how advanced and wide ranging a pianist he is. Like many fine recordings made for the Japanese label East Wind, these 1978 sessions pairing Jackie McLean with the Great Jazz Trio have long been out of print and fetched high prices from collectors.
