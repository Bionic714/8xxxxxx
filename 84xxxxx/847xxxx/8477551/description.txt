Tomb of the Cybermen (1967) Special Feature.

This is a 30 minute press conference with many cast members and makers of the episodes answering questions. The Director (Morris Barry) talks about how he had a 1st class script and cast which made filming much easier. He also says that he wished he had more time filming so he could add some finishing touches to the presentation. Another interesting thing to come from the conference was the producer talking about how they received letters of complaints about the Cybermen. One particular lady wrote to them saying that her son had had nightmares after the show and he thought that the Cybermen were real. [Richard Schuchardt]
