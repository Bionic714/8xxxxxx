,fsxCentral17,2013-05-15T23:18Z,"A propos SKIATHOS X ,made by aerosoft just come out. Greek St maarten."
,Espana25,2013-05-15T23:38Z,"is that any different than the one already available right now to download with a separate crack file? Pilot Edition what does this include please tell thank you,Kingashi bringing unique stuff as always love him for his devoted work and on time availability of Aerosoft Airbus X Extended latest downloads huge fan of him due to that ;)"
,dzonika,2013-05-16T00:49Z,"@fsxCentral17

upload Skiatos FSX installer  and I will see what can be done regarding that.
p.s. crack for Dash Q400 is working with V.1.006"
,namco-nexgen,2013-05-16T01:02Z,"I hate to spoil all the fun, but if you use the original crack with version 1.006, you will get the original once again.

The DLL is the heart of the aircraft, if you replace it with an older version... You'll get an older version.

I suspect the old crack was used with this 1.006 installer, rendering it useless."
,zlozla,2013-05-16T01:45Z,"Thank you kingashi,woriking!can you upload FSDT Vancouver?on this site you can download installer and update http://fsdreamteam.com/products_cyvr.html

Please "
,ITALY44,2013-05-16T02:08Z,"congratulations, very good"
,Airbuspfd,2013-05-16T04:41Z,"@namco-nexgen I think the crack was originally made for this version (v1.006). If you check the file sizes of the gauge you'll see why. V1.005 was about 91mb and v1.006 is 26mb (I speculate some new compression). The cracked gauge would work with the previous version, seeing they are making the same calls to the same files.

Now this is only going by the file size, if the panel itself could give a readout of the version number, then we can confirm. But otherwise, the cracked gauge and the original are the same file size leading me to believe it was meant for v1.006."
,kingashi,2013-05-16T05:17Z,"Whats fixed in this version 1.006 : 

FDE:
Aircraft.cfg: updated gear positions for smoother repositions

Switch on the ARCDU

Click the LSK8 (rightmost bottom key)

Click EXP to go to the expanded page
Hold the LSK8 for more than 2 seconds : TCAS should be activated
Click EXP again to return to the main screen"
,kingashi,2013-05-16T05:40Z,"@ zlozla

,fenriz747,2013-05-16T06:30Z,"Probably @Airbuspfd is right, in crack ReadMe file posted by @dzonika is written ""Majestic Dash 8 Q-400 (v. 1.006) cracked"""
,Espana25,2013-05-16T06:30Z,"well i can vouch its working fine no issues nothing working TCAS everything working little bit of changing's than the previous one we had here uploaded ,now the WX radar works once airborne and the FMS is turned off in cold and dark cockpit APU is a must before preparing the cockpit in the previous everything was turned on even without APU running even the WX radar was turning on at ground rather than showing standby."

Hi all. I downloaded this and i have followed the instructions carefully. When i get to the page where I have to enter any fake Order number, email and name and then copy the crack across and click next, the installer just says NOT RESPONDING.

I am using windows Vista so should I be doing something different? 

Any help will be very much appreciated."

,Squito3,2013-05-16T20:16Z,"I really can't get this to work.... I am using windows vista and everyrime I do it the installer hangs and says not responding.

A clean install is recommended...."
,kingashi,2013-05-16T20:20Z,"@ Squito3

Sry bro no idea as i am using Win7.. but someone  will surely answer ur question..."
,GentleGio,2013-05-16T21:30Z,"@ Squito3 If you already installed some Aerosoft cracked product you should know how to do it, but..:
1) Open the installer and fill the ""Authorization Page"";
2) Fill it up with random stuff;
3) Go to :C/Users/""Your PC Name/AppData/Local/Temp;
4) Search for a folder called "" nsiF2EB.tmp "";
5) Copy and paste the "" nsidll.dll "" file into that folder;
6) Proceed with the installation :)"
,fenriz747,2013-05-16T22:19Z,Name of the folder in Temp may be different for each launch the installer. Just sort folders in temp by date.

,maddog7777,2013-05-17T21:54Z,"@kingashi-Dzonika! Thanks for this and the crack. I had the luxury of testing out the first release and it was a disappointment to say the least. You guys did great, but Majestic let me down. Their website made this plane out to be all that. The propellers looked fake as hell with not movement at all. Hard starting and the basic views that pretty much come with every plane add on outside of QualityWings. But it was great to test out. I would not spend money for this add on and truthfully it should have been given away for free from the company itself. I rate it a 5 because at least the repaints were somewhat descent. Thanks for sharing as always..."
