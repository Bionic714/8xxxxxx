Any Idea to get those videos?"
,kal4metal,2013-05-16T22:15Z,"Dude, If you are a simple 30 subscriber and want to upload their vids, just use a desktop recorder software and record their vids while you are watching them and then upload them. If you do this man, you are my hero! :D"
,ianqaz,2013-05-16T22:32Z,Just got accepted into Simple 30 but I don't have enough to pay the whole $200. Anyone who wants to participate in a group buy with me post your email and I will send you a message with more details.

Can u Upload the videos plzzz"
,dontdoit7,2013-05-17T19:53Z,"Guys, nodirect in firefox doesn't work anymore! They changed something. We need to figure it out."
,realmov,2013-05-17T19:56Z,Rjvkr1 did you actually pay or are you using noredirect to bypass the login screen? 
,realmov,2013-05-17T19:59Z,"noredirect does still work they just changed the site. the new link to videos is http://projectgo.simplepickup.com/nav/episodes/

and podcasts 

http://projectgo.simplepickup.com/nav/podcasts/

only problem is there is nothing there. hopefully this is because they just changed it and havent put anything there yet. as far as simple 30 goes, you can find day 1 on bitsnoop but its missing the 90 minute pull. someone should just share their login info so we can get the videos"
,realmov,2013-05-17T20:01Z,"noredirect still works, new link is http://projectgo.simplepickup.com/nav/episodes/

for simple 30, day 1 is on bitsnoop"

Can u help? "
,dontdoit7,2013-05-17T21:47Z,Realmov i don't see any videos or podcasts there. I believe they are protecting it this time somehow. Do you have any ideas how to get your hands on to simple 30 ?
,internetboxer,2013-05-18T15:23Z,"Stop posting about their changes , they are reading this , the will find eventually way to hide it so stfu all..."
,nyzilleztndn,2013-05-18T20:03Z,agreeed with internet boxer.. hmmm private skypes :) lol.. as of now.. if a hero does not immerge and share account info.. which will be extremely unlikley and that will not work for all the people.. we need to stick to the upload thru external cam idea.. email or smething so sp does not find out. 
,internetboxer,2013-05-19T21:14Z,it is over you cant even download projectgo videos anymore...
,Saamy88,2013-05-19T21:29Z,We are not going to have any more project go videos then?
,Rjvkr1,2013-05-19T22:02Z,Hate to say but INTERNETBOXER is Ryt now we have to wait till the simple 30 month end and sm1 upload all His videos 
,BrockObama,2013-05-19T22:28Z,"Realmov, 

Theres only 27 videos on that link and we all know for sure there are more than 40 videos they have made. 
Internetboxer is right. They read this shit. Don't be oblivious. 
There has to be other links to the original. You'll find it."
,Rjvkr1,2013-05-19T22:48Z,"Not to worry guys soon we all fig out smthing sooner or later

,realmov,2013-05-20T03:16Z,"yea you can comment on each day, you just cant see the videos. we all need to try to get someone's login so we have access to the videos/podcasts. i have personally contacted 2 or 3 members who put their email in the comments. if we all try to contact the current members, we should eventually break through"
,Rjvkr1,2013-05-20T09:36Z,"Realmov

Might sm just share his login info And plzz do tell me if it happens"
,realmov,2013-05-20T16:29Z,how do i convince them to give out their login info?
,Rjvkr1,2013-05-20T17:15Z,Ask Them Beg Them Whtever Tell them Honestly The problem Dat U cant afford to buy Simple 30 so u plzz help me Tell them if they dont want to give their login info its okay just record or download their videos and Give it only to u through email or some filehosting sites plzz Do something i havent got even one rply yet

,Rjvkr1,2013-05-20T19:54Z,Tell him we dont want his login info we want only video so we wont threat him in any reason and he will feel safe to share videos
,realmov,2013-05-20T21:39Z,im trying my best he just isnt responding. and neither are the other 4. this would be so much easier with login info
,ianqaz,2013-05-20T21:53Z,"I'm going to say this again for anyone who wants Simple 30, I have been accepted but I cant pay the $200 by myself if anyone wants to help email me at product720@mail.com. If everyone contributes we can get Simple 30 and I will upload the videos ASAP."
,realmov,2013-05-20T22:06Z,i wish i could contribute but i dont have a creditcard. how much do you need?
,ianqaz,2013-05-20T22:49Z,I need about $160 right now.
,realmov,2013-05-20T23:02Z,damn. i hope you get the money. are you subscribed to project go?
,studyhard123,2013-05-21T11:22Z,"Hey guys, I'm nearly at the $200 mark, anyone who can contribute please email me at 

repear69@hotmail.com

I'll be uploading all the 30 day challenge videos within the first few days of purchase."
,studyhard123,2013-05-21T11:31Z,Hopefully we can get enough to get Simple 30 Up.
,realmov,2013-05-21T17:58Z,"studyhard123, if you do get the money, make sure when you go to day 1, when you watch the 90 minute pull video, record it with a videocamera immediately as it will play all the way through and wont pause and you can only see it once. you cant download it."
,Leahdouh,2013-05-23T02:24Z,Can't he record it with a desktop recorder than a videocamera ? Good luck guys.
,realmov,2013-05-23T03:54Z,"yea he could but those things sometimes dont have sound, in my experience. so videocamera is just easier, even though quality may be less"
,msbj11,2013-05-29T09:57Z,"So I really want to get S30.
The cost is $400.

I am not interested in scamming anyone... after you email me, ill essentially write an agreement letter saying that you are entitled to the content from S30 for the money you will be contributing... and some more stuff that entitles you to your money back if you dont get the content.. there will be more to that agreement. but yaa. 

Here is the plan.
Only those who contribute will receive the content from S30... Jesse, Kong, and Jason worked hard for this shit and they are trying hard to keep S30 from getting leaked and I support them. But for us folks that can't cough up $400.. we need an alternative.
What I am saying is that I will not post this on a torrent but will share the content amongst the people that contribute for S30.

So Im looking to get 16 people in total to contribute $25 each.
Those who contribute will receive the files through a different medium. 
I know a few people in my neighbourhood that also want S20 and would agree to this. 
As for legality purposes, this will be ""friends sharing the cost of a membership and also sharing the content amongst the friends ONLY"" 


So if your interested and want to know more about what I'm thinking and you have some way to transfer money. Email me. Ill explain more.

msbj11@hotmail.com"
,halna12,2013-05-30T03:46Z,msbj11 its $199 with a special code not $400
,halna12,2013-05-30T06:13Z,the pre-register deal of $199 is expired. the only way to get is the full cost.
,otacu,2013-05-30T10:16Z,"Hi, i am looking for people for a group buy.

I got the 199 $ code. It will expire in about 48 h.
Picture of the E-Mail with the code.
http://imageshack.us/a/img198/8297/simpleip.png

I will spend 99$. So i just need 100$. If you are interested contact me 
simple30groupbuy@gmail.com

I will just use Paypal. The hole money that I get will be transfered to anathoer Paypal account to be sure that I will not get banned after purchasing.

I will record the video via fraps and upload it to a tracker."
,msbj11,2013-05-30T10:23Z,"halna12: yaa it went to $400.. its bull but its a really good program. 

Just email me if you want more info. 



For those that are gonna talk smack.
Write a comment to yourself :)"
,halna12,2013-06-03T02:33Z,disappointed with the lack of progress re s30. and studyhard got fooled by expired code thinking it could still work. so thats a huge setback as he was up to the full $200. to get another $200 would be hard work.
,halna12,2013-06-04T05:11Z,anyone else get ripped off from studyhard??? did anyone get their money back through paypal and how???? guy wont respond by email anymore. how desperate some people can get for $50??
,dontdoit7,2013-06-04T08:43Z,"Studyhard has refused to refund me my money. His email and paypal is repear69@hotmail.com His name is Jon Varzy, his skype is ""life_samo"" . Nobody send him any $, this guy is a scammer."
,halna12,2013-06-04T09:05Z,"dontdoit7 - i lost $50 to studyhard. i sent him it by paypal. but u can't recover with paypal as its an intangible item. but i am trying to list the item as a physical one. lets see what happens. i can also try credit card chargeback.

thats correct- studyhard's details are same. what a fucking scammer"
,dontdoit7,2013-06-05T01:39Z,"DO NOT SEND MONEY TO DABASCITY. He is STUDYHARD, the same guy that scammed everyone. He has refused to show any proof when i emailed him and he demanded a $50 amazon gift card. The guy is a scammer, i am warning everyone. "
