Jack McDuff with Jimmy Forrest - 1960 - Tough 'Duff (1995)

Organist Jack McDuff's second set as a leader teams him with tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest, vibraphonist Lem Winchester (an unusual addition for this type of soul-jazz set), and drummer Bill Elliott. This CD reissue finds the group playing fairly basic material, including a pair of McDuff originals, "Smooth Sailing" and "Autumn Leaves." McDuff, Forrest, and Winchester have no difficulty chewing up the chord changes, and although no real surprises occur, the results are typically swingin' and groovin'. (AllMusic)
