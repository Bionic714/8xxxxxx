All About Tower Offense vs. Tower Defense

Anomaly 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Anomaly Warzone Earth.
Maintaining the core elements of the original, Anomaly 2 adds new features
to the single-player campaign and finally puts your skills to a test in a
completely unique experience: the dynamic tower defense vs. tower offense
multiplayer mode!

In the years following the invasion of Earth in 2018, the planet is overrun
by alien machines. Humankind is on the verge of extinction. Banded together
in huge convoys, they search the frozen tundra for food and supplies. Since
the war, the roles have been reversed: now our species seems to be the
Anomaly on a machine-controlled planet. Your convoy, Commander, is called
Yukon.

Anomaly 2 takes the RTS tower-offense concept from Anomaly Warzone Earth to
a new level. The core elements of the original Ã» tactical planning and the
on-field Commander to support troops in combat Ã» are spiced up by a number
of important new features.
