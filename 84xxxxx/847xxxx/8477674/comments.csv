,antiterra,2013-05-16T16:55Z,"I seeding as well as I can man?
I made this torrent because I collect the full serie of Borgia comics by 4 different torrent to complete the collection and I though that is right to share it know as one package for the common good!

I try for the common.."
,antiterra,2013-05-16T17:32Z, I seeding as well as I can man!!*
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-16T18:16Z,"...Must be a language barrier here. The issue isn't with the fact that you're sharing it, it's that it wasn't being shared long enough for *anyone* to get all the pieces and thus be able to help out with the seeding. Of late, I've seen a lot of people uploading and then disappearing the second they've finished the upload, thinking TPB works like a BBS. It doesn't. You need to keep seeding until there's enough people seeding to allow you to stop and move on if you need to, even if it's just one more person taking up the seeding.

...Anyway, there's a few more people seeding now, and I'll be done downloading shortly and will let this seed for a few days as well."
,antiterra,2013-05-16T18:49Z,"thanks for your comments
I will seeding as far as I can"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-16T23:22Z,"...I have it fully downloaded and seeding. I can seed it for the next 72 hours at a minimum. If you need to quit seeding, I can take over from here for that amount of time. If we keep 81 seeders going, it should propagate wide enough to stay active for a while longer.

Thanks for the original seed, by the way."
,loquorlicker,2013-05-17T06:36Z,"Thanks for the files, and don't listen to fucking whiners.

Don't listen to me either..."
