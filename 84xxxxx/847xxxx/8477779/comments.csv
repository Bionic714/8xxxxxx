If I had the ability to cap US late night talk shows, I would seed them for as needed.
Thing is, I don't have a PVR, I don't have a TV capture card, and more importantly
of all, I don't have TV access to CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, TBS, HBO The CW, or any
other US TV networks and channels, since I live in the UK not the USA.

Actually, I do have a TV capture card, but it's an obsolete 1998 Hauppauge WinTV
card that hasn't worked or been supported since Windows XP Service Pack 3!"
