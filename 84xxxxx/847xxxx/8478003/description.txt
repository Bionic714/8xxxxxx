This book about major exhibition explores seventeenth-century Iran through the reign and legacy of one of its most influential rulers, Shah 'Abbas I (reigned AD 1587ΓÇô1629).

Shah 'Abbas was a stabilising force in Iran following a period of civil war and foreign invasion. He strengthened the economy by establishing global trade links between Asia and Europe and revitalised the state religion ShiΓÇÖa Islam which is still practised today.

The exhibition will demonstrate Shah 'AbbasΓÇÖs social, religious and artistic influence on Iran through the gifts he endowed to major shrines in Mashhad, Ardabil and Qum, and his magnificent new capital at Isfahan.
The objects, many of which have not been seen outside Iran, will include exquisite Qur'ans, mosque lamps, paintings, carpets, calligraphy, porcelain and silks.

Shah 'Abbas: The Remaking of Iran is the next major exhibition in the British Museum series focused on great rulers, following The First Emperor: ChinaΓÇÖs Terracotta Army and Hadrian: Empire and Conflict. This is a unique opportunity to discover Shah 'AbbasΓÇÖs contribution to the creation of modern Iran.
