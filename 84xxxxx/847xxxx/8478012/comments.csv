You don't even know what you uploaded, do you?"
[V],Drarbg,2013-05-16T18:26Z,@napaka79 you should really google about internal notice. This is not a sample. If it was a sample it wouldve been in a dir named SAMPLE.
,napaka79,2013-05-16T21:42Z,"It is a clip of the movie that you say is in this torrent. It is much shorter than the film in it's entirety. It is an .avi file which is a file type associated with video. Therefore, it is a clip. It is from a torrent that was uploaded months ago. You are an idiot. Try actually watching this avi clip and you will see that it is a SAMPLE OF THE MOVIE THAT YOU UPLOADED."
