,epic_seeder97,2013-05-16T20:06Z,"@everyone
There has been a slight misunderstanding between kaoskrew and thepiratebay mods and so kaos have decided to stop adding their torrents to thebay. This uis what i have been said by their admins as i am on their site. They have further said that anyone willing to add their torrents to thebay can do so. So please dont blame pcgamer for impersonating anyone. Carry on the good work pcgamer. If u continue your uploads i am sure u will get a skull very soon and seed as much as possible :) :D ;)"

,sujeet26,2013-06-02T04:24Z,"i have played many kaos games but this release has some problems.
1. metro freezes after ""press any button""
2.when i ran metro.exe ,my AV pops up saying trojan with this report that it created a file at c:/programdata/windowservicemanager/iwpyvtnsd.exe
3.trojan description here ""http://cima.security.comodo.com/report/62e115ccdbf12e431418393e2ab4536d8eb17f64.htm"""
,pcgamer86,2013-06-02T11:54Z,"if u have played many kaos releases then u should have known that u should disable ur antivirus first 
and coming to freezing issue it will not repeat second time and that caused bcoz of ur low spec gfx card
steps
plz disable ur antivirus before playing game
and it will run well"
