The Early Years to 1935. The first volume is more of a documentary with added commentary; it deals with the period from the end of the Great War to the emergence of Hitler as the German chancellor. It covers the 1930 collapse of the German economy and the subsequent poverty; the SA implementing the anti-Jewish campaign; the turbulent elections; the death of Hindenburg and the re-building of Germany under the new chancellor amongst other subjects.
