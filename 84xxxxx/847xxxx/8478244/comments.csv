,MegansDad,2013-05-16T18:27Z,"@kingston567 - Do you really need to drop spoilers like that?  Why not just comment on the quality of the movie itself?

As for the quality I'd give it a 5V/5A.  Definitely watchable.  My only problem was the German subs for the Klingon and the blurred sections in each corner that apparently were used to block out people in the shot."

,tflagger997,2013-05-19T21:13Z,"evol76 - You prove yourself just a dumb when you yell all the time.

Yes, this is a crappy cam.  But scene4all did not make it.  Like most Green Skull groups, they did not even test it.  They just grabbed it from the same site as the other groups, and rushed to post it here.  

For those that do not appreciate this kind of auto-posting, just report the low quality and delete the torrent (do not seed crap).  Do not flame them, just help wreck the torrent speed so people come back and read the comments to find out why it is so slow.

Also make sure to never download another torrent from their group until others have reported it is of good quality.  You have to learn how to spot the bad shares from Green Skull groups.

Even eztv occasionally rushes a bad encode out, but you can easily tell the movie cams are bad when the same group posts two or three versions on the same day.  Spam is never a sign of quality. 

To scene4all's credit, at the time of writing this (May 19) they only have this one version, while many of the other groups have 4 or 5 minor variations of the same bad cam.  Sure a second version with the missing 5 minutes makes sense, but the others versions are just spam."

,Toxin07,2013-05-20T15:53Z,@tflagger997 Green Skull just means VIP. notthing really special about them but they are usually more reliable than the average uploader. The pink skull users are the trusted uploaders which everything they upload can be trusted and is safe.

Quality gets worse as the movie progresses.

Seek out better quality and better audio.  Boldly go where no pirate has gone before.

I absolutely couldn't stand the quality after watching the first half.  The actual movie quality, well, also pretty bad.  Wishing they would have gone forward in time, not backward to before TOS."

,crazyoliv,2013-05-25T23:04Z,"What is the hell about cam. It's 21th century. iphones are accessorily used as phone.
What is difficult about filming a screen with overloud speakers? Is it because the seat is pretty unconfortable? Does this affect the qwality? Or is it because it is highly illegal that only Spielberg-retards do it?
I would love to picture it but I ain't got no camera and I feel Theater pretty unconfortables for my back, my legs, my knees, my hears, my dough and most recently for my very-humble native conception of 3D (I feel scamed). Nevertheless.  
I won't spit in the cake, Nice upload anyway."
,crazyoliv,2013-05-25T23:40Z,"Actually, it is a very descent camjob. It is  : 
1) consistently-focused
2) dialogues are (qwazi) understandable
3) light, dazzle, and color are ok
4) flawed by a little aliasing/stroboscopic stuff, but it is ok
5) flawed by a very well hiden watermark, but it is ok, 

Which make it THE best camjob for a Sci-fi movie since ages (2-3 years easily).

I agree, Very watchable. I'm impressed. Compared to the camjob of Prometheus, this one is very good qwality, besides being free..."

Green skulls are not immune from critique, and you sir, scene4all, upload constant crap. Yeah, the DLers should wait for good copies but the uploaders should do the same. Just not giving a shit about the quality of what you upload is obnoxious. ESPECIALLY when the rest of us cannot rely on all the syncophantic assholes commenting on here ""Oh, great, 6/6 watchable"" when it is in fact so bad and cropped (cutting out subtittles and thusly important parts of the story) that nobody should try and foce themselves to put up with it out of respect for your green skull.

So, just wait for a copy that doesn't have ""watchable"" or ""good for a cam"" in the comments.
