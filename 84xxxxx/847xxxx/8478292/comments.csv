Not bad for a cam... I suspect it might be a little cropped...There is a small part missing from the beginning...

I'm gonna watch it, its watchable, I've seen and watched much worst cam uploads with far worst sound...

thanx fr the upload"

It is missing the beginning, but it isn't pertinent to the movie

It is very understandable, and the picture isn't bad.

I would give it this rating.

A:5
V:5

As I said it is watchable.

Thanks uploader!"
