Rls Notes


When the silence of the infinity desert meets
Sadhu Trance music.

Our new compilation tells the story of the
dancers, travelers and free-minded humans that
seek the spiritual feelings thet overwhelm our
souls, the desert is sercet and mysterious.

And there we find the space to explore our love
and happiness. This exclusive compilation is to be
released in a limited edition of only 300 copies.
Enjoy our tunes while you fly around among us.
