Enjoy

DRUM is a group  that releases all kind  of electronic  stuff but  mainstream.
We dont  care for any  releaseyear or source...its still all about  the music.
In the  beginning of 2002 we began to support the scene with the best of the
best ... our  goal was not  to become  group #1 in scene ... we rather
wanted  to create a strong  community out of music lovers and give our
        musictaste to the ppl who still understand the music and its spirit...
         and after 2 years we're stronger than ever before. The friendship
         that we earn keeps us continuing every single day of the year
         and it will go on like this. So we wanna say thank you to all the
        ppl that helped us over the last 2 years ... siteops, groups and
       any kind of sceners. In the  times of  flaming and  arrogance its a
      luck to find ppl with the same attitude like we have. We  appreciate
        your help and your support in any way. So if  you wanna  join our
              small  and welfare community, dont hesitate
                to contact us.

We dont care for a monthly amount of rips
its still all about the music and friendship.

Last but not least a few greets fly
