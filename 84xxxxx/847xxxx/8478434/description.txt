I downloaded this from a different torrent site but the person who created the original torrent stuffed it up

the registry pointed to the wrong install folder and it was an x64 install only
The 'right click - file finder ' option was missing

File finder did not find office 2007+ files with 4 letter extensions (docx/xmlx/etc)

this is for both x86 and x64

download and follow instructions in the install.nfo


** TESTED AND WORKING on both Win 7 x86 & Win 7 x64


** MAKE SURE YOU CLICK "register later" on first run


I WILL RESEED ON REQUEST but please make sure no seeders before requesting by downloading and starting the torrent FIRST
