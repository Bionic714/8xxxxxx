Delay the coming of Ragnarok!
The enemies of gods and men are forever striving to bring about Ragnarok, the end of days:

“The age of halberds, the age of swords;
Every shield now smashes;
The age of storm-winds, the age of wolves,
Before the whole world crashes.”

Völuspá (The Prophecy of the Wise Woman)
Translation by Jacqueline Simpson

But Thor, Lord of Storms, is not about to let that happen! Take charge of the God of Thunder or one of his allies and attempt to postpone the prophecy!
