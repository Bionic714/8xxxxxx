Hacking Politics is a firsthand account of how a ragtag band of activists and technologists overcame a $90 million lobbying machine to defeat the most serious threat to Internet freedom in memory. The book is a revealing look at how Washington works today ΓÇô and how citizens successfully fought back.
Written by the core Internet figures ΓÇô video gamers, Tea Partiers, tech titans, lefty activists and ordinary Americans among them ΓÇô who defeated a pair of special interest bills called SOPA (ΓÇ£Stop Online Piracy ActΓÇ¥) and PIPA (ΓÇ£Protect IP ActΓÇ¥), Hacking Politics provides the first detailed account of the glorious, grand chaos that led to the demise of that legislation and helped foster an Internet-based network of amateur activists.
