Note: It is live wallpaper so you can't open the app, you will need to follow the instruction above in order to set the wallpaper. Also slower/older devices (shipped with Android OS below 2.1) can't run it too, currently it has been tested on Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus and Sony Arc S so any mobile devices that is equivalent to them should run fine.

If you have put the app on SD card and restarted the phone, the wallpaper will reset to default since the system couldn't find the app first.
