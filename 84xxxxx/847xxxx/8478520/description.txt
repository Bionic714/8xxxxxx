Stanley Jordan created a new technique for playing the electric guitar.

Unlike the original Spanish guitar, the strings of an amplified guitar do not 

always have to be plucked to produce sound.  If your amp is "turned up to 11"

or if you're using dynamic compression, you can get a tone by simply fingering

the fretboard.  If you do this with both hands your name might be Stanley Jordan.



"An instant classic, and one of the definitive moments of modern jazz guitar."
