My thoughts, was if it plays fine and mkv that it was out of sync and fixed as mkv, but stripped and made as mp4, it loses that sync change (which may be held in the mkv container?).

I am downloading other copies though! I missed this episode tonight and was WAITING on it to get uploaded. I normally catch them on TV, Im a supernatural fan :)"

In MyMP4Box, select the audio stream and set the ""Delay selected tracks"" setting to 500ms and you should be good. I say ""should"" because I've never personally used that program. ;)"
