What Mobile will give readers a great idea about which phones are the best right now. There are great ΓÇÿbuyers guidesΓÇÖ which focus on giving honest opinions on the latest phones. The phones are rated by performance, features and usability so readers can see at a glance all the phoneΓÇÖs amenities. There will also be other critical elements discussed such as the battery life, video equipment and memory. What Mobile gives readers the facts straight up, unlike the vast majority of mobile phone sales people who are just after a quick sale and could neglect to mention a poor battery life or a dodgy feature which isnΓÇÖt immediately apparent to the unsuspecting consumer.
