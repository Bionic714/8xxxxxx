Patrick McGoohan's television masterpiece: a surreal sci-fi thriller about a secret agent who resigns from his job to be kidnapped and trapped in a village from which there is no escape. Striving to maintain his individuality and integrity in a place where he doesn't even have a name, Number 6 comes into dramatic conflict with the constantly changing Number 2 who has only one mission: to use any means necessary to find out why Number 6 resigned. But Number 6 isn't telling. Who really runs the Village? Who is Number 1?
