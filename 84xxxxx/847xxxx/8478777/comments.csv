and i see you haven't uploaded Ripper Owen's, which is a good thing.

,JUNEMOM2003,2013-05-16T15:24Z,The cd's were ripped from the originals. The albums are a box set. The box set does not contain any of the Ripper Owens albums. The cd's were ripped using db poweramp. Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings were remastered for the first time and are only avialable in this box set.
