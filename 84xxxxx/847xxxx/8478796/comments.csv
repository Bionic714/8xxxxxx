,Anime1901,2013-05-16T08:11Z,thanks!
,skyskrape,2013-05-16T12:33Z,no smaller version? 480p maybe?
,phat_mind,2013-05-16T14:11Z,"Who the F wants anything in non-HD anymore?
But anyway, if you want a smaller version, there are plenty of other torrents here. It's beyond ridiculous to ask this question when you are already on the site."
,alolpie,2013-05-16T17:33Z,Season finale ! cant wait to see what happens...
,tflagger997,2013-05-17T01:24Z,"The two tablets are combined, thrown into an ark, and this whole silly season is forgotten?"
,Dreadlokz,2013-05-17T02:30Z,1080p plz?
[T],teslaman,2013-05-17T07:20Z,"@phat_mind, Hey now, plenty of people still want non-HD, including me! I never understood the new fanatic hate of SD, oh well.

I'll explain... For me personally, I've never been impressed with HD screens. Too complex, pixel problems, lack of color depth (until the latest OLEDs now), pretty pointless to repair, don't last long being cheap china crap, etc etc. All for the sake of more pixels, less weight and smaller size. Too much of a loss in my opinion.

I'm perfectly happy with my rich, deep color 36"" SD CRT that will probably last as long as I'm alive, or need minimal repairs. Not only that, but I doubt anyone would dare try stealing the heavy beast! :D"
,W123.130,2013-05-17T11:54Z,"Because nobody wants an old piece of shit, not because its heavy."
,knightjeran,2013-05-18T01:22Z,So I'm gonna leave a nice useful comment and not be an idiot like other people and say: great torrent! You're the best EZTV! Thank you!
,phat_mind,2013-05-18T07:14Z,"Tesla, you suffer from some seriously faulty logic, man...
Anyway, my original point still stands - if you want a smaller version, well then guess what? You are already on the friggin' TPB - search for it!
"
[T],teslaman,2013-05-18T07:46Z,"@W123.130, Gotta say you're wrong there, heavy sets rarely got stolen even when CRTs were the only thing around. You had to pull off one of those fake mover heists in order to steal one, lol.

Oh and I'll remind you of that comment when you get old, lol. I'll be blunt, you ""new is great"" types are totally brainwashed. ""Eww it's old, that means crap!"" Ha, yeah rock solid quality vs cheap plastic junk that breaks in 6 months, LOL!

Aw it's ok knightjeran, I'm sorry for speaking my mind, how dare I! lol :P SD haters just annoy me with their smug superiority complex. As far as the torrent goes, it's flawed actually with a 500ms audio delay patch. :P"
[T],teslaman,2013-05-18T07:58Z,"@phat_mind, I agree completely with your ""just search for it"" comment, just not the typical SD bashing comment that is so prevalent today. Also FYI, people forget how privileged they are to even have the option of HD. Other countries still use and even still manufacturer SD CRTs as the norm.

Can't agree with the faulty logic either. Even heard of K.I.S.S.? Keep It Simple Stupid. :P Before anyone calls me old, I'm only 29...and so is my car, lol. I don't care to fill pages of comments with arguments, so I'll just leave you with this: To each his own and don't be a hater! ;)"
,phat_mind,2013-05-18T20:43Z,"""Ha, yeah rock solid quality vs cheap plastic junk that breaks in 6 months, LOL!""

I've had my flat screen TV for 4 years now, and my computer monitor for 6, with no signs of ANY impending problems whatsoever... The computer monitor I had before that was also flat screen, previous generation, and that one lasted 4 or 5 years.

Seems to me you are getting your information purely out of your imagination, and not any kind of reality.

,FureeTutawk,2013-05-18T21:29Z,"@phat_mind   Yes, I'd like to also say something to this person and the millions like him. Not everyone sells these downloads for a profit. So you go on selling the super duper HD versions you download for profit at a buck per disc but STFU and get OFF the pages of the ones which don't suit you."
[T],teslaman,2013-05-25T16:15Z,"Heh....phat_mind, I've read plenty of reviews stating this new junk only lasted them less than 1 year before something was broken. But yes, on average you can expect 5 years out of them. To me, that's just as bad as 6 months. I buy stuff to last the long haul, not a measly 5 years. Want quality? Try my even older CRT made mid 80's that still works flawlessly. You can't argue for quality these days unless you were born yesterday with no knowledge of the past, lol.

@FureeTutawk, I'm not selling anything, that made no sense, lol.

The End."
