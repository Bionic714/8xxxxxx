,Fantikrj,2013-05-16T17:46Z,Have some patience... it hasn't even been a full day and I don't have the best u/l speed to distribute to 13 peers simultaneously
,RoY_FoKKer,2013-05-17T00:17Z,Thanks alot ! :) i'm a big fan and there seems not many people have new ones so I thank u alot :)
,Fantikrj,2013-05-17T04:34Z,"Yup! I'll upload more if people are good about seeding, because like I said I don't have the best connection."
,ofpirate,2013-05-17T20:04Z,"like i said..DOA, now at 99.9%!"
,Fantikrj,2013-05-18T07:25Z,"Yes 99.96%. This was my first torrent and I think I fucked up in changing the info.txt after I uploaded it. Everyone should have the mkv though, and if you happen to still be missing bits VLC should be able to repair it and play just fine"
,RoY_FoKKer,2013-05-18T16:23Z,"Excellent working programs :) Thank a million :)
