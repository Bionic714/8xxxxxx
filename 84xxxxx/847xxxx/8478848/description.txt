In 1996 we first filmed Turkish Airlines on an A340 to New York JFK. Now 16 years later we return to Istanbul to find a different company! Now one of the fastest growing airlines in the world with a modern fleet of nearly 200 airplanes service close to 200 destinations and winning all sorts of awards including the Best Airline in Europe!

This program features the airlines' largest aircraft operating its nonstop service from Istanbul to Tokyo Narita.  You will find fantastic pilots who present their aircraft, the route and operation in extreme details. You'll see how our crew gets their 777 on the ground in Narita when many diverted to other airports due to extreme winds and windshear.
