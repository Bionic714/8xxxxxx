* RELEASE NOTES *    
        
DisplayFusion Pro works best with multiple screens, but you can also use it with just one. DisplayFusion is a great application that can make your dual monitor (or triple monitor or more) life much, much easier!
        
From allowing you to use a different wallpaper on each monitor, to integrating with Flickr for image searching, to providing hotkeys for managing your application windows.

* iNSTALL NOTES *

1.) Unpack and install           
2.) Use our keygen to register   
3.) Block both "DisplayFusion.exe" and "DisplayFusionSettings.exe" with your firewall solution
4.) Enjoy!

NOTE: When asked for automatic updates remember to choose "do not check"
Never rename included keygen to keygen.exe or kg.exe, program will detect those process names and will nag when trying to register

If you can't understand how to install or use this then please don't waste our or anyone else time whining about bad installation instructions.   
         
Instead of blaming us for delivering poor package try to read developer's FAQ or program's manual.
