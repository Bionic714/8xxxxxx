,coute,2013-05-21T03:35Z,"Guys, this show is in trouble! If you like it, please consider watching it on tv or Hulu! This is not an anti-piracy message, I DO download this series as well because I can get it faster and at better quality through torrent but I also go and watch it on Hulu later to increase the ratings. I just really love this show and would hate to see it cancelled! Support Hannibal!"

,jontemalmo,2013-05-22T20:33Z,"But how will it continue it if S01 ends like Manhunter/Red Dragon starts? With Hannibal inside, helping FBI?"
,Immianthe,2013-05-26T01:00Z,"Don't need me to say this, but it's good!"
