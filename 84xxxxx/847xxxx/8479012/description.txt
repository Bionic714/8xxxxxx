When notorious serial killer Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) escapes from death row and embarks on a new killing spree, the FBI calls former agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon), who captured Carroll nine years earlier, after Carroll murdered 14 female students on a college campus where he taught literature. Knowing Carroll better than anyone and close with CarrollΓÇÖs ex-wife, Hardy works closely with an FBI team and soon discovers that Carroll was not only communicating with a network of killers in the outside world, but has much more planned than just a prison escape ΓÇô and thereΓÇÖs no telling how many additional killers are out there. As Hardy and the FBI team are challenged by the ever-growing web of murder around them, masterminded by the diabolical Carroll, Hardy will not only get a second chance to capture Carroll, but another shot at redemption, as he faces not one but an entire cult of serial killers.
