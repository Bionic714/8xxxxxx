.: Plot :.
The series will feature the characters known from Thomas Harris' novel "Red Dragon" - FBI Agent Will Graham and Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who were portrayed by Edward Norton and Anthony Hopkins, respectively, in the movie version of "Red Dragon."

The straight-to-series order means that the program will not be run through the pilot season gamut, as most shows are. This will actually be the third incarnation of Harris' "Red Dragon" novel. The original was a movie made in 1986 titled "Manhunter," which featured "CSI's" William Petersen as Agent Graham and "Deadwood's" Brian Cox as Dr. Lecter.
