Notes:

Well this is version 1 only because the audio sum flaws and i didnt have any idea where the fake r6 was lol. So i used UNiQUEs resized it cleaned it i will most say most of the movie is mint in my opinion theres a few spots that just were kinda ify i think it was because it had been stepped on and or the source so idk its a damn nice vid though for a cam and but ill let you judge it so until i get actual source files to see what its like ill fiddle with unknowns but i will say this if you use vls goto your eq settings and have it on dance im pretty sure and it makes any problems w the audio basically go away so enjoy another quality encode from CrEwSaDe!
