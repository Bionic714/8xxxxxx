Trust me on this as I just came home from the premiere 3D screening at midnight and this movie is BAD F'N ASS. Give JJ Abrams another big ass Indica joint cause this movie is the best Star Trek movie yet and I have been to the premiere showings for every Star Trek and Star Wars movies ever made so think about that!!!

John Harrison (""Khan"") is a Bad MF'er and would hand our current world military leaders their F'N asses in about less then 1 minute honestly."
