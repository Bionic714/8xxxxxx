description:

"The almost perfect historical novel." --The New York Times

The Man on a Donkey is an enthralling, panoramic historical novel that brings to life one of the most tumultuous times in British history--the reign of King Henry VIII. 

It tells the tale of a young servant girl who went on to become the Prioress of Marrick, a nunnery which survived the destruction, ordered by Henry VIII, of monasteries and convents.

"Miss Prescott describes the years of decision in England with force and imaginative power, translating the abstract issues of the conflict between medieval mysticism and the Renaissance spirit, and between political ideals and expediency, into convincing stories of ordinary lives ... A most rewarding and unusual historical novel." --The New Yorker
