To those of you whom are wondering about Elric: Stormbringer - Check out the Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion (or Michael Moorcock Comics) torrent(s).

Will have loads of Moorcock goodness, such as Elric: The Making of a Sorcerer, Michael Moorcock's Multiverse.

Elric: Stormbringer was published by Dark Horse/Topps. Elric: The Balance Lost was done by BOOM! 

FYI!  ;-)"
