Our next-to-last FCUP is First Comics' adaptations of Michael Moorcock stories involving his characters Elric, Hawkmoon and Corum. Done as a series of minis, these interpretations included some stellar writers and artists, including Roy Thomas, Mike Baron, Gerry Conway, Roger Salick, Rafael Kayanan, Mike Mignola, Kelly Jones, Jill Thompson, Michael T. Gilbert and P. Craig Russell!


Each of my First Comics uploads contains two .txt files, one called 'First Missing' and the other, 'Eclipse Missing', in preparation for my next upload project. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the listed email. I want to make these uploads as complete as possible. Thanks!

Thank you Mr. Moorcock, thank you creative teams and and thank you scanners! Get it, seed it!
