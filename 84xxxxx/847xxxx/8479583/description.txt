The voice and guitar of globetrotting Folk-Punk legends The Men They CouldnΓÇÖt Hang, Phil ΓÇÿSwillΓÇÖ Odgers, didnΓÇÖt really start out here intending to make a proper solo album. However, the online success of his country covers EP, in particular KristoffersonΓÇÖs iconic ΓÇÿSunday Morning Coming DownΓÇÖ, was received so well, he has now assembled a hand-picked gang of cohorts to record ΓÇÿthe Godforsaken VoyageΓÇÖ.
The Kristofferson song is included here too, and sits alongside lower key moments from other greats in Gene Clark (ΓÇ£Through The Morning, Through The NightΓÇ¥, a stunningly beautifully mournful and sparse country waltz featuring Eliza Carthy), Tom Waits and also his own TMTCH band mate Paul Simmonds, on the lamenting ΓÇ£Dusty FieldsΓÇ¥, and ΓÇ£His Masters WhipΓÇ¥, as well as featuring five Odgers originals which more than stand up here. The sound is simple, spacious and refined with a gentle folk and country feel; acoustic guitars are layered with accordions and violins, banjos, cajons and organs to compliment Odgers plaintive croon. Produced, engineered and mixed by Mike Glossop (of Waterboys/Van Morrison fame) the soul of this material is in its characters - the downtrodden, world weary and oppressed workers. The characters in these narratives have a clear affinity with the land and their environment (SimmondsΓÇÖ contributions in particular). The title track is a contribution to a project set up by acclaimed Aussie Mick Thomas concerning Australian colonisation; its industrial revolution setting is a backdrop for newfangled machines stealing jobs and livelihoods, violent uprisings and penal retributions. ItΓÇÖs certainly a powerful opening shot. The best of OdgenΓÇÖs self-written tunes (ΓÇÿNamesΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿWrong SideΓÇÖ) too are sharp and melodic folk-pop tunes that are hued with just enough regret and storytelling nouse to sit comfortably along his careful selection of covers.

The album closes tenderly with a hushed, almost stately, folk waltz through Tom WaitsΓÇÖ ΓÇÿBottom of the WorldΓÇÖ. While WaitsΓÇÖ absurdist imagery is in some stark contrast to the other more earthly-bound material on offer, its as good a version of the song as anyone could muster, and a fine conclusion to a hugely enjoyable record. Not simply for the worldwide TMTCH faithful, Odgers talents as a singer/songwriter and interpreter are all shown off with grace and conviction here.
