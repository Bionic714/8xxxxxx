,Movienut117,2013-05-17T04:13Z,"Hell yeah. Tiny file. Fast dl and Awesome movie. 

Quality not the best but movie was so darned good i forgot i was watching cam . 

Thanx a ton man! a7-v6"
,Iceburgslim,2013-05-17T04:23Z,Is this missing the beginning too?
,michaelrwatson,2013-05-17T05:16Z,"Yup...missing the beginning. Also, I don't think there are any subtitles for the Klingonese.

So, the question: what kinda retard ups a rip where you can't even understand what they're saying in key sequences..??"
,Djcole,2013-05-17T06:57Z,"Thank you so much for risking your ass to bring us this movie.. michaelrwatson your an ungratefull
ass"
,michaelrwatson,2013-05-18T04:43Z,"Djcole, you need to retake 8th grade English class.

Anyway, tode and xxxlarval didn't risk anything--this is recompressed from a larger file. (so i wasn't really criticizing TODE)"
,BarryFLASHAllen,2013-05-18T23:05Z,"@Djcole you're a fucking moron. the first 5 minutes is probably the most crucial. where would the movie be, if we missed the first 5 minutes of the first star trek movie? the first 5 minutes of any of the dark knight movies? the first 5 minutes of ANY James Bond film? are you fucking high? the intro is THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE TO THE GOD DAMN STORY!! so ya, if the movie is missing A. translations to an ALIEN FUCKING LANGUAGE, and B. the ENTIRE FUCKING INTRODUCTION, then yes, we are going to bash the torrent, and the original uploader, for their piss poor job of capturing THE ENTIRE FUCKING FILM!!!"
,taosk8r,2013-05-19T03:18Z,Does anyone know if there is a version out with the klingon subs in english?
,michaelrwatson,2013-05-19T11:20Z,"WARNING: This is shitgarbage. Has terrible epilepsy-inducing flicker throughout.

@TODE/xxxlarval: You are assholes, or better yet fuckin retards, for upping a shitcam of a movie like this."
,blackheartless,2013-05-19T13:25Z,Thanks for trying but this is only about HALF the movie waste of time downloading 
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-19T17:53Z,"...What? You can't speak KLingonaase or pIQad? Kuvekhestat tera'ngan HabIDaH!

,BarryFLASHAllen,2013-05-20T04:02Z,"@evol76 lmfao your comment made me laugh. so it's ""low lifes"" like us, who comment on torrents, is what's making this world go to shit? a little harsh to blame the oil crisis, the war on terror, and all the insanity going on in Syria, all because we post our opinions via the internet. lmfao, stop crying, build a bridge, and get the fuck over it. if anyone is a wee little bitch, it's you kiddo."
,BarryFLASHAllen,2013-05-20T04:04Z,"oh, and one more thing, snoochie boochies bitches.

-The Flash"
,Toxin07,2013-05-20T16:00Z,@BarryFLASHAllen your rant about the first 5 minutes being important is not actually true for this movie. You can ge tthe jist of what happened after the scene finishes. Basically they are saving the planet. to do so they distracted the race by stealing something important and freezing the volcano. Seriously you made a big deal about nothing XD
,samlan414,2013-05-20T17:49Z,"So just a heads up. I went to see this last night in the theater and that Klingon scene wasnt really crucial... just Klingons well being Klingons : what are you doing here, why do i care, we will kill you... blah blah. and the first 5 mins Not at all important. Pike yells at kirk about it and you get the whole situation anyways NOT A BIG DEAL! Thank you for the torrent i couldnt wait to see it again untill dvd rips are out so i downloaded this"
,EForce36,2013-05-20T19:46Z,"If you use the VLC player, you can always go into tools, and effects/settings to play around with the equalizer to make cam job audio bearable."
,dolphinshow,2013-05-23T02:07Z,ya that watson dude its just going around saying that.. what is the point? i dont get it. movie is still in theatres what does he expect?
,IACSC,2013-05-24T00:23Z,"@michaelrwatson

Are you going to say the same thing about each upload about Star Trek: Into Darkness?
WARNING: don't listen to michaelrwatson.

How about you? Have you uploaded anything as of yet?

Thank you, uploader for this."
,.235.,2013-05-24T23:18Z,"come for the freebies, stay for the comments"
,Lucixir,2013-05-25T07:59Z,"I downloaded this and this is what I have found. The video is pretty nice, but the audio portion is like stuck in fast forward. I tried slowly it down in different players, but there was no way to slow it down enough to make it seem normal.
I have never seen a video with the visuals really good but the audio set in fast forward before, I tried 6 different players but none of them worked correctly. I am assuming the uploader changed the audio stream/file and that is why this is all messed up.

I was really excited about this, because as I said, the video is pretty good, very watchable but the audio is beyond horrible and makes it unwatchable, yet understandable."
