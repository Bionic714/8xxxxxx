Of course, only if you are willing to spend your time doing that. Personally I'm dying to see Kong's 90 minutes pull "

@Rjvkr1 I myself have contributed, a long with many more people to reach this total. We haven't hit $200 because of lack of contributions, if you really did care yourself my man, then you would have contributed to help us hit $200, instead of sit that, you're sitting here leeching.

We still have time to gether up another $40, I don't know if any of you guys care enough to help out, but if we end up not being able to pay for it, all refunds will be sent out. GL getting hold of Simple 30 then."

,dontdoit7,2013-05-28T19:47Z,Can someone please upload month 14 videos and podcasts?
,msbj11,2013-05-29T09:56Z,"So I really want to get S30.
The cost is $400.

I am not interested in scamming anyone... after you email me, ill essentially write an agreement letter saying that you are entitled to the content from S30 for the money you will be contributing... and some more stuff that entitles you to your money back if you dont get the content.. there will be more to that agreement. but yaa. 

Here is the plan.
Only those who contribute will receive the content from S30... Jesse, Kong, and Jason worked hard for this shit and they are trying hard to keep S30 from getting leaked and I support them. But for us folks that can't cough up $400.. we need an alternative.
What I am saying is that I will not post this on a torrent but will share the content amongst the people that contribute for S30.

So Im looking to get 16 people in total to contribute $25 each.
Those who contribute will receive the files through a different medium. 
I know a few people in my neighbourhood that also want S20 and would agree to this. 
As for legality purposes, this will be ""friends sharing the cost of a membership and also sharing the content amongst the friends ONLY"" 


So if your interested and want to know more about what I'm thinking and you have some way to transfer money. Email me. Ill explain more.

msbj11@hotmail.com"
,kal4metal,2013-05-29T11:40Z,"@msbj11 Dude, you are going to distribute S30 on a piracy site, and in order to get it we'll have to pay? What is wrong with you guys?? I support Simple Pickup with all my heart, but it's not only that we don't have 400$. For instance, I'm 17, a student, unrmployed and... a minor. So I can't pay even if I can give you money!!! Not only that. Most of the SP fanbase is full of guys 18 and younger. It's not that we don't want to pay. WE CAN'T! What the fuck man???"
,1capricorn86,2013-05-29T16:25Z,"We are already in the process of getting the money

A guy named Studyhard123 is already collecting so no need to start a new one msbj11

Look at the earlier comments, his email should be there, he is only missing about $45 

I will pay $20 on friday when i get some money, and then Studyhard123 will record the videos somehow."
,realmov,2013-05-29T17:45Z,yea everyone contribute to studyhard123 since he will actually upload the videos on here
,yakem07,2013-05-29T19:01Z,"So, anybody will keep uploading project go videos and podcast?"
,msbj11,2013-05-29T19:08Z,"My friend actually gave studyhard123 $45. 
And is now trying to get it back through PayPal.
And studyhard is not complying. 

Instead studyhard is on the simple pickup forums asking other people to share their s30 content with him. (Evidence of that can be provided for the $45 and the PayPal case and a message of him asking around on sp forums)

So if you want to contribute to him. 
Be my guest. I'm not saying he is going to scam you. 
He may actually get simple 30 and upload it... 
But I have a feeling he is trying to make a profit along the way from what he is doing to my friend.

And to be honest, I understand the underage thing. 
I am trying to keep this as legal as I can by not profiting off of this and not sharing it with the public. Sp keeps a close eye on here. So once I get all the content and it is all of it.
I may/may not put it on the bay. 

Cheers folks."

What I am saying is that I will not personally post the content on a torrent but I will only share the content amongst the people that contribute for S30. This way I dont run the risk of getting the account banned. So hypothetically speaking, someone who contributes can upload it to piratebay.

,Danteloe,2013-05-30T22:24Z,"Not ruining your little ripping off fun msbj11, but here goes:

msbj11 claimed to have $200 on the forums, and that he wasn't able to purchase Simple 30.

http://www.simplepickup.com/forum/questions-advice/21576-simple-30-a-3.html#post186433

But on piratebay, 4th page of this torrent, I quote:
(So Im looking to get 16 people in total to contribute $25 each.
Those who contribute will receive the files through a different medium.
I know a few people in my neighbourhood that also want S20 and would agree to this.
As for legality purposes, this will be ""friends sharing the cost of a membership and also sharing the content amongst the friends ONLY"" )

Not looking for a reply from you msbj11, but I'm just saying if you're trying to get something through us, you'd better try harder."
,msbj11,2013-05-30T23:28Z,"That post on simple forums is mine and was when studyhard said that the price was up'ed to $400... It's purpose is in hopes they will reduce their goddamn price. And also when my friend lost his $45 to studyhard. Long story.

reaper69 (studyhard123) and my buddy have emails that show studyhard claiming to have colleted ""$200"" and he purchased simple30 and downloaded everything and the files were ""corrupt"".  And then told him to stay patient. 


Regardless. That does look fishy. 
And if you don't want to contribute. 
I honestly don't care. 
I feel that the people that are emailing me know what I'm going for and read what I had to say. 
And the people that are planning on contributing are in a group email so it's a group effort. 

So this isn't me convincing people one on one. 
At this point I don't care what you think. 
Don't have time to waste arguing with a troll on a comment section."
,msbj11,2013-05-30T23:32Z,"""If your trying to get something through US""

,nyzilleztndn,2013-05-31T00:46Z,"listen men, shall we. i think studyhall was scammer i donated only 10 bucks to make sure.. if ur legit bro ill hook u up with 25 but only when theres proof. im not donating to any new scammers.. and NEW PEOPLE STOP TRYING TO ORGANIZE UR OWN GROUPS.. aka dante.. thats only ganna make it diverged. thanks . "
,msbj11,2013-05-31T01:30Z,"The only method of proof I felt was reliable was being fully transparent and talking amongst a group (through email/whatsapp/skype/msn)
Not here on a public site.

And i was thinking an agreement letter that could be used against the person receiving the money that could get your money back through paypal.

Im free to any suggestions.

,realmov,2013-05-31T03:19Z,well at this rate we arent getting s30 anytime soon. someone needs to come up with $400 themselves and then upload the videos on here. Thats really the only way this will work. Unless you guys wanna go back to begging s30 subscribers for their login info
,msbj11,2013-05-31T04:43Z,"If someone actually does the donation way. 
Make sure you word yourself wisely on here about collecting donations.

,dabascity,2013-05-31T22:04Z,msbj11 is a scam. e-mail me at dabascity@gmail.com if you want the videos. 
,Danteloe,2013-05-31T22:38Z,"@1capricorn86, that's not such a good idea.
I think studyhard, a member that was collecting donations has tried to outsmart SP by using the expired code, but it did not end well. 
The best way is to raise the $400, or else you're going to lose what you buy.

Like your friend, I to did contribute to studyhard123 fund. I gave him $50 towards it. I made it very clear that if he did not get the account before the $200 offer expired, I wanted a refund. I have so far sent him two emails to request for a refund and have received no reply. If he did in fact get the account and has the intentions of sharing its content to this community I would be happy. But I haven't heard a word from him that he got the account.

If anyone is planning to donate to this guy (who I should name, but won't) you probably won't get it back. I fear he has taken my money and run."

Im sorry to hear that, i just bought it, you can see this screencast image i took here:

http://screencast.com/t/CrNOzjkK0J

I will send to the people who give a donation, think it should be around 20 people so it's only $20 each

 think $40 for 10 people would be a little to much.

Just have to find the best record software so no quality is getting lost."

,ali112,2013-06-01T19:50Z,"@BenKJ That's really sad. Unfortunatelly there are a lot of people who just think about themselves and it makes difficult to work collective efforts like that. Try to get your money back through PayPal. 

@1capricorn86 An alternative you can do it's to upload one by one each day and in the comments always someone offer donate to the next one. So you upload the specific day just after you get paid through PayPal. It becomes more secure and accessible for those who can afford it. What do you think? :)"
,realmov,2013-06-01T20:42Z,noone is going to upload s30 to the tpb so stop asking. if you offer to donate money to the people who just bought it they might send you the videos but dont beg.

,Danteloe,2013-06-01T22:41Z,"@realmov

Someone does need to, but it's never going to happen if we just sit around and insist something happens. We need to find someone and give them our support."
,realmov,2013-06-01T23:56Z,im sure people can afford to donate $20 collectively each month to support someone who gets project go. just 4 people donating $5 a month would do it. and then we could all enjoy project go

Have you read my suggestion to 1capricorn86? You even suggested something like that before. I think that's the safest and the cheapest way to achieve our goal. The other way haven't been working so far."
,Danteloe,2013-06-02T03:03Z,"@realmov
@ali112

I'd be able to take care of PGO, but starting it all depends on if people are going send in ""donations"" on a monthly bases.
PGO is $20 a month, and for safety purposes we need a VPN. Which is roughly $10 a month. 
This insures I'm not connected in any way to the seeding of this torrent. 

Thoughts?"

I appreciate your initiative, but I can't help you with money. Besides that, I have a girlfriend for almost two years. So even if I could afford it, definetely it wouldn't be among my priorities right now. I just like to enjoy the content at the same time I keep practicing my English listening, since it is my second language. I'm just trying to help with an idea, even if it isn't much. One last thing, I don't think it's really necessary a VPN, but if you prefer to share in a safer way, I understand.

@1capricorn86 As I understand, you said before you want that around 20 people pay you $20 before you record and share the files with them, right? So it's more like the old way I mentioned and that hasn't been working so far. The only difference I see between both is that instead of raising money to buy and share, you just need to share. The way I've suggested seems safer and makes more affordable for more people because you will be releasing the S30 in parts. Anyway, that's just a suggestion. If you paid for, you do whatever you want.

I hope you understand my point guys. Have a great week!"

So im trying to find a way to upload them somewhere (as soon as i get them) so u ppl can download them from there ! I think i might be able to do it through a server in my university(im studing computer science and the provide us 2 servers for each student). BUT im not sure for how long will i be able to keep the files on this server cauze they are scanning them once in a while and they might find them. I think i will be able to keep them there for about a week so once i upload them i will right the link in the comments and u share the link with other ppl so they can download the files for as long as i can keep them on the server.

I have gotten videos everyday from him. he is not trying to scam you. and right now he is the only person you will be able to get simple 30 from. so donate to him so we can all get project go. 
,dabascity,2013-06-05T16:46Z,"My guys get the days as soon as I get it. That's 12 midnight every time. I reply fast and I try to help out with any problems if I have the time. Be careful of those that say they have 'proof'. More than likely they have the first couple of days I gave them for my proof and will not be there to give you the rest. 
dabascity@gmail.com"
,ali112,2013-06-05T18:05Z,"dabascity said yesterday: ""Already have Simple 30 and references for proof. Screenshots and DL links. Asking for donations. ..."" Today: ""Be careful of those that say they have 'proof'."" Besides that, he isn't carrying out with his earlier promisse. So why should people believe on his PGO promisse now?

He arrived here blaming a user not showing arguments: ""msbj11 is a scam. e-mail me at dabascity@gmail.com if you want the videos."" Now he's putting himself as a victim as if people aren't believing on him unjustly.

Why it must be paid with an Amazon gift card? Is it because you can't complain and have a chance to get your money back as with PayPal at least you can?

Two users said he wanted $50, but one who said he bought from him paid $20. What about dabascity excuse of just accept $50 for not to be unfair with earlier buyers?

Also, his posture is too marketer. He say he doesn't care with who doesn't believe on him, but he doesn't waste an opportunity to make an advertisement on each post and he keeps here giving excuses.

Be careful and don't fall on his chats like this: ""And to be honest. The less people that see this program the better. More game to learn for the rest of us. I never pleaded you guys to believe me because I honestly don't care to prove anything, but for those that want to take a chance then go ahead. But I'm not begging."""
,JiJis,2013-06-05T18:47Z,I am one of the guys that dabascity is sharing the videos with . I GUARANTEE U 100% that he has the videos and he is sharing them with the rest of us who donated. Stop trying to prove that he is a scam he is not . Here is a pic from my desktop http://prntscr.com/18evbg . U wanted proof that he did send the videos here they are . One more pic : http://prntscr.com/18evog
,dabascity,2013-06-05T19:14Z,Al if you put your energy into doing pickup than you do studying a guy and making multiple accounts I think you would be at a level of Jesse Kong and Jason but instead you're obsessed with a 'scammer'. I'm just laughing at you. I hope someone who got some of my freebies uses their 'proof' so they can charge you and run off.  
,dontdoit7,2013-06-05T19:28Z,"Jijis images are not any proof what so ever. Those images can be faked easily. Like i said its the same guy. Listen to what ali112 said. The guy asked me for $50 amazon gift card, and realmove said he is charging 1/8th price? $50 is not 1/8th. So not only he comes up with different amounts each time, but he also refuses to upload one of the days. If you want to prove it that you have simple 30, upload day 3. Uploading one day won't do anything for those that don't have simple 30."

,realmov,2013-06-05T21:48Z,@dontdoit7 $50 is 1/8 the price of $400 which is what it would cost to pay for simple 30 yourself. so you should donate to dabascity because it saves you money plus he will upload project go if he gets enough donations

Way too sketchy and completely unwilling to cooperate, along with the comments he's received I didn't trust him. The proof that I requested was a screenshot of a video playing with a notepad document open with my email address and his typed in there. Since he was so sketch about sharing proof and having people scam others like he probably is haha! I wanted proof that was specifically for me and that would look sketchy if shared with someone else.

termon1 was fully willing to send me the same kind of proof that I requested to dabascity and I instantly paid him and received my first video last night. "

Please, read the following comment, you'll better understand what probably happened. The comment was written by btsobo:

""Guys this microload guy is in collabo with SP. That upload of Simple 30 day 1 and the whole action of ""microload"" being busted by Simple Pickup was created just to scary us, thepiratebay users.
Isn't it strange, where we were able to download a folder containing 2 different versions of video? I mean, one of the clips was almost the same as the other one, but with just an exception. In the ""real video"" which is I think available to simple 30 subscribers, there was nothing mentioned about bonus clip video (Kongs 90 min pickup). The other one was longer and contained some sort of scam. I was able to read through the comments under Simple 30 days (but couldnt watch videos) and i figured out there was never a bonus clip.

What is more, the accusation post which was meant to be sent to microload by SP team, was a fake. It contained false link to the site with law help which never existed

In other words, it was a well prepared provocation.""

,jarkkko,2013-06-07T14:38Z,"ok, so I gave dabascity $5 in order to get first six days and if this worked I was ment to give him the rest. I sent him an amazon gift and he sent me back day 2 twice, day 3 and 2 motivational speeches which I didn't ask for and then he said if I want more then I have to send him another gift and I should have paid him upfront, so it would be cheaper. After that he started whining that I'm a cheap ass and yada yada. Although these episodes are legit I wouldn't suggest anyone to trust that retard. Just another internet scammer.

Now I don't know how to put up torrents, but if someone who does contacts me I am willing to share those which I have."
,ali112,2013-06-07T16:47Z,"I think it's clear that there are some people selling the S30 without owning the full program. For example, looking at termon1's screenshot you see he has just 8 items in his SP folder. After that, dabascity said as if termon1 had gotten from him the videos but he had sent just about 7 days. Maybe some scammed people now want their money back by scamming others. So be careful! It had been shown hard for someone to afford with $200 here, even more with $400, and suddenly appeared many people claiming to own the program and asking for ""donation"" to share privately? You can pay and get the videos, but it seems there's no guarantee you will be able to get them all.

@JiJis I see your side looking the way dabascity has been handling it, but I wish at least you can get the full program as it was promised to you by paying."
,sickchest,2013-06-07T18:57Z,"I'm thinking about paying the full price for the program. What do you think would be the best way to earn people trust and get donations?

Why are you so worried about that? Are you the same user or were you injured by dabascity's e-mail desactivation? Sorry, but if due his attitude you won't get anymore the remain S30 videos for you, we have nothing to do with it. It was a deal between you both, not with the rest of us.

Why are you asking for Rjvkr1 to take down this torrent? It looks like the kid who owns the ball. If his friends aren't playing as he would like, he cries and he doesn't want to play anymore taking the ball home. But at this case, I guess as Rjvkr1 got the videos from you (at least he said he paid you), will you intimidate him by stopping sending videos if he doesn't do what you want? What are you earning doing it? Will you feel better with yourself doing a babyish thing? You won't be prejudicing us, but just the new users who have even less to do with it.

If he's not a scammer, why haven't he sent to you the full program, for what you paid for? So do you think his attitude is fair with you who paid because of the rest of us who haven't seen enough reliability on his approach? There are some guys here selling S30 without having the full program. Maybe he just used the circumstances as an excuse or he's just a very immature guy. Besides that, he always treated us as competitors and that if just a few of us had access to S30, would be better. His arrogance just showed us how huge his ego is. But if he's a straight person, he will contact you back after he stops crying on his pillow. If he do not, make sure you will get it soon or later on TPB. Additionally, there are great content about PUA you can put into practice and develop yourself. When I started with this PUA thing, there are no SP guys, but Mystery and Style, for example, who made all of this huge and SP possible. I had great results with them, but now I have a girlfriend which it is good and bad at the same time. :D"

3) The guy provided no proof what so ever, and demanded $50. JiJis and Realmov were so much defending him, and none of them could post proof. Why would they care so much about that guy? It is not hard to upload day 3 here and prove to everyone that you have simple 30.

So far both of you keep saying that you have videos but you won't upload them now. Why can't you upload just one? The fact of the matter is you don't have ANY simple 30 videos. You are the same guy who created 4 accounts and scammed everybody, you are a sad piece of shit."

Also, for the many that keep saying that he is a scammer, have you contributed? 
If not, then stfu -_-.

,Danteloe,2013-06-10T05:30Z,"@everyone talking.
If you are saying that dabascity is legit, then upload some videos showing proof that you have received videos from him.
If you can't do that, please just leave, you're making yourself look like an idiot."

,JiJis,2013-06-10T23:13Z,he uploaded PGO not S30
,realmov,2013-06-10T23:43Z,"haha the dude uploaded ONE video. not any q&a's, podcasts, or the other may live stream they did. Plus noone is uploading simple 30 so i still need a $25 amazon giftcard from anyone and ill start sharing s30"
,margalordyzd,2013-06-10T23:45Z,First share then ask for donations.. that simple 
,realmov,2013-06-11T00:08Z,so if i share the first 8 days will you give me a donation?
,margalordyzd,2013-06-11T01:16Z,of course if you share everyone including me will be more likely to donate
,zakco,2013-06-11T01:16Z,@realmov Upload days 1-8 except day 6 because i already got the link for that via your screenshot 
,realmov,2013-06-11T01:53Z,could i make it into a .rar file to make it easier?
,zakco,2013-06-11T02:03Z,why not
,ultdbz,2013-06-11T02:35Z,"realmov, if you share the first 8, we'll give you donations and you can buy and upload the rest of s30, I think that is the best way because if you actually do upload all 8, you'll be the first and probably the one that we will all be able to trust the most"
,realmov,2013-06-11T17:56Z,tpb wont let me post the direct link but here are the first 8 days of simple 30. http://postimg.org/image/4ci0b9i59/ email me a $25 amazon giftcard for the rest
,JiJis,2013-06-11T19:23Z,"first 8 days where those that dabascity gave us , are u sure u have the rest of them after he stopped sharing them with us couple days ago ?"
,realmov,2013-06-11T19:45Z,Ill get the rest of tbe days once i have a $25 amazon giftcard. I only need one giftcard and then i can share with everyone and eventually pay back whoever gives me the card

,joker-8888,2013-06-12T19:52Z,"@realmov

It looks kinda strange to be honest.
You got the 8 Videos from dabascity, and he is refusing to give the rest off the stuff. 
Every donation you got you gave to dabascity.

Do you have anything past Day 8? What do you want to do with the money?

I spent $56 total on S30 on here with not much result. dabascity and you gave not much transparency but you are pissed if asked for it. Its kinda sad you dont really understand the situation.

@Everyone who is thinking to contribute:
If the person you are going to contribute to has NOT all videos and/or can NOT prove that he has all the content, then dont contribute."
,joker-8888,2013-06-12T19:53Z,^ I did NOT contribute to dabascity or realmov btw. Didnt wont to imply that.
,Rjvkr1,2013-06-12T20:23Z,"Joker8888
What can we do if u didnot get any videos by paying 56$ To sm scammer that doesnt give u any ryt to stop contributer from donating 
We were getting video and we will get videos again with sm donation so plzz back off i dont wanna abuse here anymore to call everybody fucking retard
After 30 dys will up one of them from us will upload s30 videos on tbp okay so now back off 
sorry for ur loss but dont create obstacles for us bcoz of ur mistakes"
,joker-8888,2013-06-12T21:08Z,"first of all, show some goddamn respect and dont call people retards, thats not nice.
secondly, I am sharing the experience gained by beeing scammed or by mistakes done by others.
If you could not understand what I meant, I will say it again:
I said that people should NOT donate if the guy hasn't all the videos yet. SP can and will track them down (by PayPal-Account, Name, E-Mail etc.) and ban them. When the person has all the contant of S30 that wouldn't matter, if he doesnt the people donating won't get everything. Thats important to know! 
That the person has to prove he has everything in a transparent way is kind of logic.

You know, you can talk people into donating without having some kind if ensurance if you don't have any risks, its not your money.
But they can lose it. So stop beeing egoistic and think about others.

It should be very easy to provide prove if you have all the content. If you dont have all the content and you are saving up for S30 to purchase, than have the decensy to tell it to us (the possible donaters).
So no, I will not back off telling people to be smart."
,realmov,2013-06-12T22:43Z,"Maybe i wasnt clear as well. I am trying to get the videos from someone else. I do not have them. However, people on here know i am willing to share them once i get them. I am asking for a $25 amazon giftcard. You donators can put your money together to buy one and then send that to me. I will then give the giftcard to the person who has the videos. He will give me the videos and i will share them with all of you. I think this is very reasonable and you guys should be able to put together $25 collectively. So please help me out so i can help us all"
,zakco,2013-06-12T23:30Z,"I consider realmov the most trustworthy at this point, all money transactions should go through him"
,kal4metal,2013-06-13T01:22Z,"Hey, realmov was asked to give the first 8 days as a proof, so he did. I have them, you have them, everyone can have them. He's legit!! So just donate 25$ on an amazon giftcard, so we can get S30! I would donate aswel, but I'm still 17..... "
,realmov,2013-06-13T03:46Z,@kal4metal you can still go to the store and pay for a giftcard with cash. Just saying
,jpegfind,2013-06-13T04:23Z,Don't give to realmov. I sent him the  $25 amazon gc n I got scammed. hes going to keep asking for 25$ don't give to him. fkn scammer
,realmov,2013-06-13T07:08Z,I didnt scam you; dabascity did. I gave your gc to him and then sent you videos. I never had access. So its not my problem someone else scammed you
,jpegfind,2013-06-13T07:44Z,This guy is a liar. I never spoke to dabascity but he worked with him. realmov told me to give him a code to give dabas but he then ignored me. don't trsut realmov he's just trying to get the money he got scammed for by scamming everyone else. 
,joker-8888,2013-06-13T11:25Z,"@realmov
if its only $25, why don't you pay it yourself? sounds harsh at first, but think about it: If you get all the content for just 25 bucks, you can show us prove that you have everything. then you can share some of it everytime you get money. (something like: 22 Videos remaining, 25 bucks. so like 5 bucks for 4(or 5) videos)"
,Rjvkr1,2013-06-13T14:00Z,"I think here is no one here crazy enough for s30 to pay u guys gotta take the risk to trsut us just buy a gift card and send us code its not like u will gives us code and we will us it on the spot 
if u want videos u gotta trust us or otherwise s30 will always be dream for us 
so pay realmov "
,realmov,2013-06-13T19:20Z,"wow you people have major trust issues. i understand a lot of you, including me, got scammed by dabascity but im trying to help you guys out. i did decide to pay for it myself since noone can contribute but im not in the mood to share if you just keep bashing me. maybe ill just wait until i have all 30 days and then maybe ill upload that"
,joker-8888,2013-06-13T21:12Z,"@realmov
yes! please wait till you have all 30 days! that way it is more likely to get all the content.
about the trust issues: since you have been scammed too, I'm sure you will understand. 
Think about the deal I suggested. $5 (there are $5 Amazon-Giftcards) for 4 videos will get you the $25 you paid back - and if you can - in 30 days - prove that you have everything, people will trust you.
I dont see any problems or much work with that suggestion, so why don't you like that?
Last but not least: I dont know what others wrote, but Im glad for everyone contributing to getting S30 to the PBay! I tried it twice, just with non (1st try) or lil (2nd try) success. Its no bashing, just suggestions to make things smoother. Again, thank you for paying the $25 - I'm sure you'll get it back once you have all the content!"
,slipshod1,2013-06-13T21:31Z,"guys i remember realmov trying to find the videos from the begining.
my guts tell me that he is not a scammer but even though i cant prove it, you cant prove im wrong also. so at least dont accuse anyone without knowing all the details. 
you can make suggestions but dont accuse him for something you're not sure of."
,kal4metal,2013-06-13T21:47Z,Guys realmov is not a scammer! He tried to help from the very beginning. 1st he tried to find the videos by talking to different people. 2nd he uploaded 8 fuckin' days so you can see that he's legit!!!!! Studyhard123 and dabascity scammed us... Thanks a lot man for playing 25$ yourself.. I hope we can see S30 soon.
