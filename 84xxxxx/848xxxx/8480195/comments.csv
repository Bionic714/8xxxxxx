,beedog11,2013-05-28T01:57Z,Can you upload in 1080p?
,jalucian,2013-05-30T14:01Z,"1080p is always my first choice. If you see me upload something *only* in 720p, it means I couldn't get my hands on a 1080p source. However, from now on, any time there's only a 720p source like this, I've decided to encode them with the same bit rate that I use for my 1080p's. This will allow people to full-screen the 720 on larger screens and get the same quality as a 1080p. "
