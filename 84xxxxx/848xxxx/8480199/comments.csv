Thank you for the upload... As for the movie... WOW. Probably the worst ""scary movie"" I've seen in a long time. About halfway through the movie you keep thinking the climax is about to come... But it really doesnt other than the last 5 minutes of the movie.. Which was boring as hell. This movie made no sense and I would only recommend this movie to anyone who does not have anything better to download and watch. Seriously though... If you're gonna watch this movie, don't get your hopes up =/"
,mrknowitawl,2013-05-19T16:39Z,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS DUMB ASS MOVIE. I JUST WATCHED THE TRAILER AND I CAN SAFELY SAY IT IS A PURE SHIT DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS CRAP....ITS SHIT
