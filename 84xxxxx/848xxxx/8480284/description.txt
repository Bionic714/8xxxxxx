http://worldairroutes.com/AirCanada190winter.html

==========================================

For the 1st time in the fantastic Air Canada series you get to experience a program featuring domestic destinations within Canada! In addition this program was filmed in winter to allow you to discover the airline's winter operation including de-icing and other procedures used in cold weather and low visibility. The Embraer 190 is a very versatile aircraft as far as the routes it operates for Air Canada with short distance flights such as Toronto-Ottawa which lasts around 40 minutes and long distance flights such as Toronto-Kelowna which lasts close to 4 and a half hours! As you can see below we feature 3 sets of crews, including the Embraer Fleet Manager, with all pilots giving you the usual Air Canada treatment with continuous explanations and presentations!
