Thank You!

Look..I know everyone has their opinions..but this movie..its..Perfect!

No..seriously..watch it..compare it to 'modern' films especially in the character ""attitudes""..watch William Devane as he is 'tortured' by those around him after returning 'home'..brilliant..truly..somehow..the script..is short yet..yet..manages to convey..SO much..the bad guys are..BAD..the 'good guys' are damaged..its sooo good.

I truly think this is a great classic.

So thanks truly..I Love this movie.."
