,Vandread9,2013-05-25T09:47Z,ill try to re encode another dual audio last episode for you
,PwntSoup,2013-05-25T20:51Z,"vandred, i think this is just part 1 of a series, if you check the last ep its just after the credits, there is dialog that might be explaining we have to wait till the next season, there is no need to go to any trouble if thats the case, i had just finished watching all 25 ep's in a row over 2 days strait and was a bit let down by the ending. thanks for all your great up loads i dont mean to sound ungratefull."
,Vandread9,2013-05-28T12:43Z,"yes i know there is a part 2 called Code Geass R2 , i will be encoding it soon , thats why it makes no sense as of yet"
