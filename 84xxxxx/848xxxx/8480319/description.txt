Plot:
Persona 4 begins on April 11, 2011, with the protagonist, a high school second year, arriving in Inaba to live with the Dojimas, consisting of his uncle Ryotaro and his cousin Nanako, for one year, as his parents are working abroad.[17] Just after his arrival, a TV announcer is found dead, her body hanging from an antenna; Saki Konishi, the high school student who had discovered the body, is later found dead under similar gruesome circumstances.[18] After the protagonist and his friends accidentally enter the TV world, they encounter Teddie, who helps them travel freely between the TV and real worlds.[19] They awaken their Persona abilities, and, realizing that the murders stem from Shadow attacks in the TV world, are able to rescue several would-be victims. Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise and Teddie accept their other selves, which become giant Shadows in the TV world, and join the group as Persona-users. Mitsuo Kubo, a student from another high school who disappears following the death of Kinshiro Morooka, the protagonist's foul-mouthed homeroom teacher, claims credit for the murders; it is eventually learned that Kubo only killed the teacher and played no part in the other murders.[20] Naoto Shirogane, a nationally-renowned "Detective Prince" investigating the case, is also rescued and joins the group, who learn that "he" is actually a girl who assumed a male identity to avoid the police's sexism.
