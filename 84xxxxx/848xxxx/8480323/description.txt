This lengthy, 7-part documentary series was the central feature of the Iron Man [2008] Bonus Disk. I have already offered up all of that here:

but the size of that will keep the seeders lower than they otherwise would be. I figured this was sufficiently attractive to deserve its own torrent. The subs and audio are in English, Spanish, and French.
