,Cracked87,2013-05-18T16:40Z,"When I try to compile my game, It doesn't work. It just freezes. Do you know how to fix this issue?"
,xXxZombinexXx,2013-05-19T09:22Z,"@Cracked87: What OS (Operating System) are you running on? And if you try to compile it to a single runtime executable, it will either freeze or show an error.

If you are trying to compile it to a single runtime executable , try another type such as Windows NSIS Installer or Compressed Applications zip.

I have no problems using this on Windows XP Professional."

I have Windows 7 Ultimate. You're right. When I tried to compile on single runtime executable, it freezes but when I tried the other options, it worked. Thanks xXxZombinexXx! Keep it up!"
