,sultan14,2013-05-16T17:18Z,fake
[T],SneaKyMK,2013-05-16T17:28Z,How can you say it's fake when I haven't seeded it to everybody yet? The album is out in the Phillipines on iTunes and I purchased it so I'm pretty sure it's legit
[T],SneaKyMK,2013-05-16T17:42Z,"...and here's proof that it's legit http://i.imgur.com/XgWqahE.png
Don't ever comment saying one of my torrents is fake again!"
,Juniki,2013-05-16T18:19Z,arrrr  thank you fellow pirate !
,FireStorm50,2013-05-16T23:22Z,"Hey SneaKyMK, thank you for this purchased album! Great quality too! And btw, don't listen to sultan14, he's nothing but a stupid asshole and loser trying to ruin your torrent, if he has nothing to say then fuck him, ban him or kick him out whatsoever, I hate it when people say it's fake file when it's not true"
,Shilaly,2013-05-18T00:19Z,"Wait could you explain this to me, I was under the impression that AAC is a lossless codec yet it says the compression mode is lossy. 
What that means? :p"
,zheee,2013-05-19T12:09Z,"fake. the tags are completely wrong and the files are not tagged with ""mastered for itunes"", like the original itunes version."
[T],SneaKyMK,2013-05-23T20:09Z,The Philippine version isn't mastered for iTunes only UK and US Versions
