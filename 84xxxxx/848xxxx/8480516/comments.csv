,aldurbano,2013-05-18T13:27Z,Very well done. Thanks :)
,NCC86,2013-05-23T03:58Z,This sounds exactly like the 1993 remaster and the 2013 remaster isn't due for another week or so. Are you sure of the source for these recordings?
,bobfrancais,2013-05-25T03:33Z,I think this is the remaster it sounds pretty good to me . we will have to wait and see if someone else will post one in flac when it comes out at the end of the month. But i think this sounds great for 320 mp3

,Zoticus,2013-06-02T21:48Z,"Don't turn live recordings into MP3s please, the tracks don't flow together unless you use some kind of lossless format."
,NCC86,2013-06-03T06:17Z,"So I went and compare this to the 1993 remaster and it is indeed sonicly different and is the newest remaster. Also, there are spots where the crowd is more audible than the old version and some instruments in the right channel when they were in the left. Anyway, this is the new remaster. Now will someone please upload the bonus disc from the deluxe edition remaster with the Cow Palace live tracks. "
