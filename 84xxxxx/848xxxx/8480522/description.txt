Wiki - Kin-Dza-Dza 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin-dza-dza!

Released in 1986, as the Soviet Union was approaching the end of its run, Georgiy Daneliya's Kin Dza Dza become something of a cult phenomenon. A scifi comedy that catapults an odd couple - a construction worker and a music student - to a far off planet the film has a large and loyal following thanks to its clever comedy and slyly satiric elements. It's a film that's never really gone away and now it's coming back in animated form.

Intended to open up Pluke, it's language and the wonderful world of Kin Dza Dza to the world in a more accessible (?) fashion, Ku! Kin Dza Dza is the animated retelling of the cult Russian sci-fi, steam-punk, comedy in a more modern Russian setting.

Once more directed by Georgiy Daneliya, this time alongside Tat'yana Il'ina,
taking the original story by Georgiy Daneliya and Revaz Gabriadze, This animated
tale of a dystopic desert planet and it's inhabitants unleashes the fantasy in a
manner impossible in standard film, and nicely done.
