,marvelnerd76,2013-05-16T21:38Z,Awesome upload Mothra! Thank you
,BSnapp,2013-05-17T03:04Z,"Issue #'s 10 & 24 won't open. The error I get says, ""This document contains empty pages"". I'm just telling you, in case you get more comments about it, and feel like re-uploading those two. I know it's a hassle. GREAT torrent. Thank you for keeping the GA alive"
,Mothra67,2013-05-17T05:33Z,"I will try and see if it can be fixed on my end, but i do not think so.  I will try and see if I can open them on CBRreader or Comic rack and post here the results.  I didn't check them, I just downloaded the file from somewhere else"
,Mothra67,2013-05-17T05:40Z,"OK, I tested both the issues in comic rack and they opened fine!  issue 10 has 60 of 64 pages, and 24 has 52 pages, meaning the books when scanned were incomplete.  I cannot fix that!  try upgrading your comic reader to the latest version of Comic rack!  I hope that helps"
,aeonwing,2013-05-18T08:58Z,My head just exploded. Thank you!!!
,Mothra67,2013-05-20T01:06Z,"OK guys, this big file I also will no longer be seeding for the same exact reasons as the Black Condor upload.  this thing reached over 20 on my share ratio, and has uploaded over 25 gigs!  so pleanty of folks got it, keep it going as my limited bandwidth cannot!"
