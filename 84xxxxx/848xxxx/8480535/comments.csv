If you had Reloaded crack earlier use that 
OR 
If it was FLT's , use that !"

Folder config:

C:Userstên máyAppDataLocal4A GamesMetro LL

ở trong này có các folder ứng với từng bản RLD, FLT hoặc Update2Revolt (mỗi lần dùng crack mới nó sẽ tạo ra một folder khác). Nếu bạn đang là RLD hoặc FLT thì nó sẽ có sẵn 1 folder, sau khi update vào game thì nó sẽ tự tạo thêm 1 folder config và trong đó chứa file config (folder toàn số). Bạn Copy cái tên Folder mới (folder bản update, không phải folder bản RLD hoặc FLT) rồi Paste sang Folder Save Game.


Folder save game:

C:Userstên máyDocuments4A GamesMetro LL

Bạn copy cái folder config ở trên vào đây. Trong folder ""Metro LL"" cũng chứa sẵn 1 folder (tên toàn số, trùng với folder config của bản bạn cài - RLD hoặc FLT). Sau đó qua cái folder save game của cái cũ, copy toàn bộ cho vào trong cái folder mới mà bạn vừa lấy từ bên folder config.



Xong rồi đấy. Với update thì nhớ đổi tên ""UserName=gìđó(revolt)"" thành ""UserName=RLD!"" trong steam_rld (trong nơi cài game).

go into the folder ""C:UsersYOURUSERNAMEDocuments4A GamesMetro LL""

Fixed no into movie/cinematic
Fixed not able to change resolution in game (crash)
Fixed all UI overlays shown at incorrect aspect ratio.


Initially I only copied 3/4 of the updated files over and assumed that keeping the original reloaded cracked version of metroLL.exe in place would be fine.  This is not the case. you need to use the reloaded cracked metroLL.exe included with this update (or the FLT version if you like I suppose)."

Any ideas guys? "

just copy the steam_api.dll from the crack folder and place it to you game folder, tada! ready for game! but for me, it didn't fix alot of things. runing on radeon 7990HD"
,spectrev,2013-05-31T11:24Z,"Great torrent, made game playable again. And you folks who broke their game:
1. Ask yourself a question, what your crack is? FLT or Reloaded?
2. Let's say you have FLT, then put files from FLT, and Update folder to the Metro Last Light.exe location.
3. Game shall be working, if not buy it."
