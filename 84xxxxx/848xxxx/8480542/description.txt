Basically it is a customizable WhatsApp where you can change lots of colours, sizes, and many other visual MODs
In addition you can increase upload media limit (stock limit is 16Mb) to send large music files or videos
You can increase quality of pictures sent (by default resolution is decreased quite a lot)
You can share music just with one click
You can add contact profile pictures to their chats
You can hide contact profile pictures and show phonebook pictures (in chat screen)
Built-in theme viewer and downloader. Check WhatsApp+ users themes online and apply theme if you like
And more to come
