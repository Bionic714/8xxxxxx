Years ago, Alice Liddle became one of the few to escape the far-reaching clutches of Wonderland.  This alternate reality was once considered the "realm of dreams"  but has since become a world of madness which had fed on the sanity of humans that were sacrificed there.

Wonderland's sadistic ruler, the Jabberwocky, has been gaining power from the Liddle bloodline for generations with the intent on shattering the border between Wonderland and this world.  Alice knows deep down that this entity is after her family and she must find a way to stop it before her deteriorating psyche gets the best of her.
