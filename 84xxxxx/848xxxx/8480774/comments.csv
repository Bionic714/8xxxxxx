Sorry for the trouble."
,paulcarroty,2013-05-17T09:11Z,"thank for good quality. This is pop+electrodans, no alternative rock."
,Thompson93,2013-05-17T14:42Z,"@paulcarroty 

+1 this is not Alternative Rock... and it isn't the 30 Seconds to Mars we know..

However, Up in The Air & Conquistador are pretty good."
,pcftw,2013-05-17T18:37Z,"Fuck this album, sick of the pretentious chants and tired of the ""we will rise"" type choruses. Also fuck this torrent, glad I downloaded it elsewhere, from a place people don't fuck with the tracks, and fuck 320kpbs too. Also fuck you. "
,filteredglitch,2013-05-19T15:52Z,"not sure if 30STM got permission to put Gangnam Style on their album, but it is track 10.  ;)"
,ThePyro5,2013-05-20T12:04Z,I don't care what everyone else thinks. I love this album. Thanks for putting it up!
,Marrtu,2013-05-26T13:29Z,"LOL
