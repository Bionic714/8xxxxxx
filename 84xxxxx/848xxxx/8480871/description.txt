A hypocritical and selfish older sister holds power over her younger, unselfish and humanitarian sister by hiding the shame of her younger sister's pregnancy, with the purpose of upholding the aristocratic status of their name and household. Or that is what we are told, because underneath the facade, is a story of two sisters, who have had intimacy with the same man.

Based on a story by Halld√≥r Laxness.
