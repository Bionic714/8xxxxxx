once more deep thanks for re-seeding of Frida and Agnetha videos. I'll serve these for a couple of time and re-seed them systematical for the other leechers. Some other lechers were able to finish downloads via my mirror, too.

Most of them only a few number of bytes are missing. Thanks in the name of a number of TPB members and long time ROSAmannen fans!

Hope the list of Abba songs is not to long for seeding. But Abba fits perfect to your actual releases of ESC songs. Btw, in my opinion Abba was the most sucessful group that had it's ignition at ESC. And Abba and Loreen come from your home country Sweden, too.


Regards, Tom B."
[V],RosaMannen,2013-05-16T23:36Z,Hello Tom B. I Will reseed the Abba-videos tomorrow. I need all the bandwidth for the esc-videos now. Something strange has happened to the missing Muse-video. I simply can't find it in my collection anymore :(.
