The torrent titles was taken offline from some group who does not know the difference between Camrip and R6""line"" source. They concluded that it came from an R6 camera source. Just to break it down in easier terms for you. NO SUCH THING! Camera sources are broken down into two groups PAL and NTSC. Region 6 means China and it did come from China yes! However when you label R6""line"" refers to DVD VideoRip source and this is not.... It is a Cam version only. If you like Cam version, then by all means enjoy DL it. But I want you to know what it is, since they are misleading people just to get them to DL their garbage. Enjoy!!!"
