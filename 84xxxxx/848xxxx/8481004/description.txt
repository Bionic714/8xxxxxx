The 1910 Fruit Gum Company - The Best Of-Simon Says

The 1910 Fruit Gum Company was a prototypical bubblegum rock group, manufactured by house producers (Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz) using anonymous studio musicians (vocalists Mark Gutkowski and Joey Levine, guitarists Frank Jeckell, Pat Karwan, and Chuck Travis, horn player Larry Ripley, and drummers Rusty Oppenheimer and Floyd Marcus).  The band name was invented strictly for appearances in order to make the group look like a real band rather than a tossed salad of random artists.

Many of 1910's song titles took their names from children's schoolyard games and expressions while the content centered on high-school teen love.  Hits include "Simon Says", "1, 2, 3 Red Light", "Goody Goody Gumdrops", and "Indian Giver".
