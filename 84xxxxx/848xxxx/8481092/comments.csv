,Trikyas,2013-05-20T09:58Z,Why is no body seeding??? and seriously mr.lyris why aren't you seeding??? PLEASE SEED!!! 
,mr.lyris,2013-05-23T16:50Z,Says who?
,mr.lyris,2013-05-24T03:17Z,"It's interesting with all those that complain when a torrent is freshly seeded of how slow the upload is expecting a high priority torrent of over 7gb be seeded in an hour not realising that not everyone who shares online are in countries fortunate to have 100 mbps connections. Yet, we bitch and complain and never turn around to say thanks for taking the time off to complain. Many complained while the torrent seeded yet not a sound said thanks in return. I wonder if every seeder stopped seeding how would some of us react, but then again, maybe why some personw will be called sharers, the others, LEECHERS---these are the real pirates."

,mr.lyris,2013-05-28T23:30Z,"@motstandet
Programme installed and worked perfectly for me. I think your problem may be due to Microsoft .Net 4. Simply update .net and run the programme again."
