Greetings Pirate Bay!

Introducing Seaven Studio, a new indie studio that recently opened up after the closure of late Hydravision! 

We have just announced our game, Ethan: Meteor Hunter, and we released an Alpha Demo in order to get feedbacks from players: you! You can help us make the final game better! Once you have played the demo, a "feedback.txt" will appear in your installed folder. Please open it, answer as many questions as you can and send it back to us to "feedback at seaven-studio dot com". 

We have started a greenlight page in order to discuss with the community about the game and the demo, feel free to join!

About the game

Following unknown events, Ethan got touched by meteorites giving him the power of telekinesis: moving objects around while the world is on hold! 

In a journey through 3 different worlds and 50 levels, Ethan will try to regroup all the pieces of the meteorite that hit him in the first place in a tremendous puzzle-platformer adventure!

Have fun!
