period for this album including their first hit single "A Fool In 

Love". Three brand new tracks were also included, "I Don't Wanna 

Fight" being a top 10 hit in both the U.S. and U.K. The album also 

includes Turner's version of The Trammps' disco classic "Disco 

Inferno", a song she had often performed live in concert during 

the late seventies, but was never previously recorded in studio. 

Two tracks from her 1984 breakthrough solo album Private Dancer 

are included as well, the title track to the movie and "I Might 

Have Been Queen". The album hit #1 on the UK Albums Chart and was
