Written by major contributors to the field who are well known within the community, this is the first comprehensive summary of the many results generated by this approach to quantum optics to date. As such, the book analyses selected topics of quantum optics, focusing on atom-field interactions from a group-theoretical perspective, while discussing the principal quantum optics models using algebraic language. The overall result is a clear demonstration of the advantages of applying algebraic methods to quantum optics problems, illustrated by a number of end-of-chapter problems.
An invaluable source for atomic physicists, graduates and students in physics.
