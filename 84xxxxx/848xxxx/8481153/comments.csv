,jing577,2013-05-16T22:05Z,anyone get this to work yet?
,markofbear,2013-05-16T22:14Z,"Fast download, didnt get a virus warning (but it isnt updated so dont take my word that its clean) so far working perfectly!"
,Kababus,2013-05-16T22:17Z,"It's working :D

I am actually playing it and it's good."
,sillo441,2013-05-16T23:33Z,The installer does not finish installing the game is just freezes at the end...
,killing78,2013-05-16T23:39Z,"I seem to be having some trouble running the game, when i go to install the installation freezes right when the loading bar is full. However, i am still able to open the game after I close out the (apparently) partially completed installer. Everything runs smooth until the actual game play where all the textures, giants and landscape are unrecognizable due to a glitchyness....

im thinking a corrupt installation, but it could just be my rig...im running windows 7 by the way.

I have tried reinstalling 3 times, and always same results, any suggestions?"
,killing78,2013-05-16T23:41Z,thanks for the upload Anon...very timely for an indie game released today
,tritiann,2013-05-17T01:13Z,"hey sillo441,  it froze for me at the end too, but randomly i clicked on the icon it made on my desktop to launch the game and it launched and the installer finished, i alt tabed and clicked finish and it was good to go.  weird, i know.."

,ZtorkX86,2013-05-17T04:53Z,"Killing78

Have you tried installing different drivers for your video card, use admin rights for the game and install it in a different folder than the typical program files/x86?"
,Kyashii,2013-05-17T05:50Z,"The installer appears to freeze at the end, but just wait it out and it's fine."
,Kababus,2013-05-17T09:00Z,"If installer is freezing, just wait a minute, and it will end. Maybe someone uploaded this as Anonymous, because he don't eventually need problems, or he's scared ? xD"
,ptlk,2013-06-04T16:46Z,i added both patches today to TBP
