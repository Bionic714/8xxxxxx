,Doaty,2013-05-18T15:18Z,"Is the Ranger DLC included in this shiet? Last update I installed (Had issues with lag) made all my saves useless and not only that, but also removed the ranger mode."
,Doaty,2013-05-18T16:32Z,"Nevermind, I realized I had nothing to lose so I went for it anyways. Runs great, ranger DLC included, fixed all lag issues I had and my old saves even worked! Cheers."
