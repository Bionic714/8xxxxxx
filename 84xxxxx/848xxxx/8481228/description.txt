A Good Day to Die PAL DVD SUBS EN ES NL
=======================================

This is an ISO file to enable the creation of a PAL DVD of the latest Die Hard
movie.

Simply use a single layer (4.7gb) DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW or DVD+RW and the DVD
creation software on your computer (may be Nero, Roxio etc) to create the DVD.
You only need the large ISO file to do that.

Included is a short sample of the movie's mpeg from which the DVD was made,
and a still image from the sample. 

-------------

The movie was taken from one of the 720p torrents currently available.

I converted it to 25fps and scaled it to an effective resolution of 1024 x 554
within a 720 x 576 frame anamorphically stretchjed by your DVD player to give
a 1024 x 576 effective pixels 16:9 view (as seen in the sample image).

The average bitrate was 4600 kbps, peaking at 8000 kbps. The audio is stereo,
English only (with much Russian, naturally).

The subtitles were located using www.subtitleseeker.com

The subtitles are:-

English for non English parts (default)
Dutch
Spanish
