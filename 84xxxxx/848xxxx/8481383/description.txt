In the days before the July 19, 1969 space mission
that marked humankind's first steps on the moon,
NASA was working with a group of Australian
technicians who had agreed to rig up a satellite
interface. That the Aussies placed the satellite
dish smack dab in the middle of an Australian
sheep farm in the boondocks town of Parkes was
just one of the reasons that NASA was concerned.
Based on a true story, The Dish takes a smart,
witty, comical look at the differing cultural
attitudes between Australia and the U.S. while
revisiting one of the greatest events in history.
