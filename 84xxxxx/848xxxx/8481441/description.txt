Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, May 16 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down the Obama administration's attempt to exclude and intimidate the establishmentΓÇÖs political opposition as scandals burgeon and Obama's handlers scurry around in damage control mode. 

He talks with writer and political columnist for The Washington Times, Joseph Curl, about Obama's cornucopia of scandal. 

Alex also takes a look at the Benghazi emails and the government's brazen surveillance of journalists. 

On today's broadcast, Alex welcomes filmmaker Kevin Booth to the show. Kevin talks about his latest film, American Drug War 2: Cannabis Destiny. 

Also on today' show, Alex talks with veteran political organizer, speaker, and writer Larry Pinkney in-studio. Mr. Pinkney is a veteran of the Black Panther Party, the former Minister of Interior of the Republic of New Africa, and a former political prisoner.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
