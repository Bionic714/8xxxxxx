Coach Salinas (Jamie Gillis) is returning for a reunion with the some teachers he worked with, and a student he had on his football team 5 years earlier. He has changed a lot in the last 5 years, but first we get to see how he was 5 years earlier and it is quite an entertaining view of the trip on the bus of him and his football team to a football game. On the bus all sorts of sexual shenanigans take place and coach Salinas is trying to hook up with the cheerleaders while Annette Haven (a teacher) is trying to hook up with the star football player who she has her eye on.
