SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

From IMDB:
"The real story of the partisan Silvio Corbari. He starts his career killing 
publicly one of his friends that was a fascist. Than, he set up a band of 
partisans in north Italy, completely independent from the Italian organized 
resistance (CLN). Ines, leave his husband to join the band and became Silvio's 
lover. Silvio Corbari succeeded also to set up a free-zone, his personal 
republic, independent from the Nazi occupied Italy, in a little village called 
Tregnano. But the opponent Nazi-Fascist army is too much for any kind of 
resistance, especially if not included in the organized CNL. All his partisan 
friends are captured and sentenced to death, Ines, close to be captured, 
suicides. Corbari, even if survives to a first hanging, can't escape to a second 
one. After WWII he deserved a gold medal to the memory from the Italian 
Republic."

Another one of the rarer, lost Macaroni Combat films.  Italy, for the most part, 
always likes to present itself as a victim in WWII, but it was part of the Axis, 
as we all know.  This film attempts to glorify a national hero, Corbari the 
Partisan.  In itself, it's a good film and the execution scenes are a bit on the 
realistic side.  It's a good one to have in your collection.

This was ripped from a Thai release.  I have not seen it available anywhere 
else.  Funny how one has to go to the other side of the globe to find films that 
should be available on DVD at home!

Enjoy!
