True, but mine are in a different format, have higher standards of ripping, and a full description. Don't get pissy, do a better job."

First part of your comment is useful info, and courses with better quality are always welcome.  Last phrase was an unhappy one, on my opinion..."

As was his. I upped a fresh rip because I downloaded his originally. As a video course on paintings, visuals were particularly important here, but the quality on the rip was inadequate. So, I quietly offered a better one. Notice that I did NOT go to *HIS* torrent and offer a link, like a jerk. I did NOT write in my description that I had a problem with his. HE came here and got pissy. Since nobody gets paid for all this, or depends on it for a living, or is anyway the original artist, *I* found *THAT* rude."
[V],dohduhdah,2013-06-08T02:04Z,@rambam1776: I'm just pointing out there is another version available on tpb. I'm not saying you shouldn't upload your version. Any alternative version is always welcome (bigger or smaller).
