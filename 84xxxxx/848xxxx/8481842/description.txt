Dan Snow presents live coverage of a tribute to the aircrews involved in the
bombing raids of May 16, 1943, when 19 Lancasters took off on a mission to drop
Barnes WallisΓÇÖ ingenious bouncing bombs on dams in the Ruhr Valley to try to
flood the industrial heart of Germany. Veterans and their families gather at
RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, to commemorate the 133 men who undertook the
attacks, with a fly-past by Tornado jets from the current 617 Squadron,
Spitfires and a Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.
The QueenΓÇÖs Colour Squadron and the College Band of the RAF end the event with
a sunset ceremony.
