This is not what I call a recommendation for vinyl."

,press2012,2013-05-17T17:06Z,Thanks for posting Do you have a flac version of Woo-Hoo by the 5.6.7.8's? TIA.
,greull,2013-05-17T20:32Z,"Cheers press, I only have it on Bomb the Rocks 2LP, which side a is basically Bomb the Twist. If I ever get a full day off I may rip that 2LP. But to be honest don't count the days, we'll see."
,]eep,2013-05-26T16:04Z,"you can post all the links you want to audiokarma, but that doesn't make it anything more than a budget cart. Just because ppl post on audiokarma doesn't mean they are right or wellinformed. I know because I'm posting there too. 

If you try a cart (and TT) somewhere over the $100 range you can have a nice life too. And better sound. "
,greull,2013-05-30T13:33Z,"]eep, this is an anonymous, internet, www, quarrel. Nobody wins. I love my PL-115D and OM20, you don't, c'est la vie."
