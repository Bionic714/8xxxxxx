Whether you want a bunkie as much-needed guest accommodation for friends and extended family, as a place for the kids to hide, or as an all-purpose extension of your cottage space, there are few buildings as iconic in cottage country as a cozy mini-cabin. Maybe you want to adapt a bunkie as a tool shed, an art studio, or a cottage office. But just how do you build one? Designed by Wayne Lennox, Cottage Life' s Smart Bunkie gives detailed plans, a materials list, and comprehensive, step-by-step building instructions that will take you through the process, plus useful tips on railings, porches, and loft ladders.
