description:

Washington budget watchdog William Proxmire died in 2005, but the creator of the Golden Fleece Awards for wasteful government expenditures would warmly endorse David Cay Johnston's book. In Free Lunch, Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-┬ûwinning New York Times journalist, uses his investigative skills to expose tax dodges and federal "free lunches" for the super-rich. With the determination of a single-minded sleuth, he tracks legislative and lobbyist conniving that bilks Americans of billions of dollars each year. Whether you're right, left, center, or just innately skeptical, this book will confirm your worst fears.
