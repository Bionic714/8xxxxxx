,pitch_mod,2013-05-17T20:42Z,"I didn't know so many people would grab this so fast.  Sorry it's taking so long.  I don't have very fast upload speed; especially with so many downloading.  If you're one of the first to get a complete file, please keep seeding to help out others."
,quarkme,2013-05-17T23:11Z,awesome thanks!
,pitch_mod,2013-05-18T18:19Z,"Let me know if there are any problems with the wineskin, and I'll do my best to help."
,McDiezel,2013-05-18T22:02Z,"For me it's appearing on the dock as opened for a few seconds, than closes, I got a late '06 IMac and I'm still on 10.6 so it's probably just my computer, but I'd like to know if there's a fix"
,pitch_mod,2013-05-19T12:08Z,"Does your imac support 1920x1080 resolution?  From what I see, only the 24 inch model from that year does.  The text file contains instructions for changing resolutions.  It will crash at startup otherwise."
,pitch_mod,2013-05-19T12:10Z,"I'm not sure whether or not 10.6 could affect it.  I should have mentioned that I used a 2012 imac with 10.8.3 to make it, and the other laptop I tested it on also had 10.8."
,ryballs,2013-05-21T09:48Z,Why did u set the default to 1920x1080? I set all my mac ports to 1280x800 for compatibility reasons..
,pitch_mod,2013-05-23T20:49Z,"Yes, you're right. I should have.  This is the first time I've ever shared anything that I've done with anybody else though, and I was thinking that more people would want a higher resolution, and only the people that couldn't display it would have to go through the process of changing it.  I should have set it lower though.  Lesson learned.  Luckily, it isn't hard to change."
