Earl "FATHA" Hines was of seminal importance to jazz piano.  This live album

from 1965 finds him at his peak.


What I like most about this album is the blues playing of Budd Johnson on sax.

Budd plays on (5)of the tracks.  Track #3 CAVERNISM is a total "GAS," as they used

to say.  Half way through the tune Budd switches from Tenor sax to Soprano sax for

some inspired blues improvisation.  It's hard to believe that these guys were

essentially jamming.
