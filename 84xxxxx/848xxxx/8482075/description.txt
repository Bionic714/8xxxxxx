"Haden is a man of great personal courage and political insight, and he has played some of the best jazz bass I've ever heard, but this record--despite all those nice reviews--is competent Jazz Composer's Orchestra style ensemble jazz, full of nice dissonances and not much more. I've listened to it many times, always giving it one more chance, but I doubt I'll ever play it again, and no one I've ever played it for has come back to request it." C+
