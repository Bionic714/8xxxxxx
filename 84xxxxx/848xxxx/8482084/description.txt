"The first three albums occationally go off the deep end trying to preserve the claims to maniacal metalism, but when they stick, their sensation is nothing short of sexual." ***
- Mikal Gilmore, Rolling Stone

"Musically, Long Island's only underground band impales the entire heavy ethos on a finely-honed guitar neck, often at high speed, which is the punch line. And the lyrics aren't inaudible, just unbelievable--a parody-surreal refraction of the abysmal "poetry" of heavy, with its evil women and gods of hellfire. Which is not to suggest that it doesn't become what it takes off from. But is that bad or good?" B+
