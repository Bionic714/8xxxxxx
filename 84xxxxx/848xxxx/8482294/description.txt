Here are some songs I have been listening to that I thought you might like.

The titles are meant to be read as if they were a poem of some sort.





Erin, wake up alive and amplified.
Do you realize?
There is a light that never goes out,
Blowin' in the wind.

Ever fallen in love
With someone you shouldn't've?
Time of the season,
Two weeks, no rain.

Flagpole sitta burning down the house.
Should I stay or should I go,
Search and destroy
A punk psycho killer?

Where is my mind?
Jane says no one knows.
My eyes to see December,
Steady as she goes.

Sex and candy.
Just because,
Smart girls
Take me out.

Turning the century lump.
My tears are becoming a sea.
Broken heart loser for the girl.
What a way.
