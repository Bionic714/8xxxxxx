,drlingkos,2013-06-06T07:55Z,What's the chance of someone uploading The Big Bang Theory season 6 in the AVI format? I've tried to convert from MVK and MP4 then burn to disc but I am having trouble. It will burn to disc ok but you can only play one episode at a time. Does anybody have any ideas on what I can do? Thanks!!!
