,technoxy2,2013-05-17T17:08Z,"Same as others -- all must be from same source, Deutsch (because of the German words used in the partially blurred subtitles).

Includes full opening with producers logos and sounds.
Curious about the repeating of scene.

Visual = 5 out of 10 -- watchable but far from ideal
Audio = 4 out of 10 -- audience ruins at very beginning but fortunately keep silent throughout movie"

thx soooo much for the upload!!!! Still seeding =)"
,tflagger997,2013-05-20T21:28Z,"evol76 - Stop shouting all the time.

michaelrwatson - Just add your rating and comments.  If idiots waste their time downloading crap, that is their business.  If TPB had a ratio system you would have something to complain about.  Since it does not, just delete the torrent (&data) so that you are not helping to seed a bad torrent.  That will kill it off quickly enough."

,dlarrym1111,2013-05-21T03:28Z,"@aplldth:
The term on torrent site for seeding while you are downloading is LEECHING. I'm not joking, some people think leeching is to download and to not seed at all or to have a movie completely downloaded then sign off. Those last 2 examples are called ""BEING A DICK""!!!

In all seriousness, By the definition of leeching as it pertains to a Bit Torrent process or Bit Torrent sites, A ""LEECH"" is someone who is seeding but hasn't finished downloading the file yet. Some think that when you see the number of leachers, that those people are downloading and NOT seeding but the opposite is true.
look it up:

I can only assume the ""d"" stands for ""dumbass"".

Either that or you are 12 years old.

Leeching is a term that came about long before you even heard of the Internet. While your link may refer to it also as ""people downloading that have not completed the download"", it's incorrect...to the point of stupid.

Leeching is exactly what it sounds like. It's people that download (leech) without uploading. In this case it refers to those that download and disconnect as soon as the download completes. They do not seed beyond the point of getting the full download themselves.

We used this term in the 70s and 80s on something called a BBS (Bulletin Board System), long before the internet was open to the general public (it use to be for military and scientists/universities).

Leeches were people that downloaded files (usually games and porn pictures) and never contributed anything in return.

I know you kids like to usurp (yeah, another word you probably don't know) terminology and use it incorrectly but it really has to stop.

I know LEECH is a term you see on all the torrent sites but it is used incorrectly."
,Epif,2013-05-23T05:03Z,"@minnecrapolis

It is absolutely, undoubtedly, irrevocably, 100% irrelevant that leeching meant something else in some other context 30+ years ago. All he was doing is explaining what leeching means in the context of torrent. So you, sir, are the dumbass."
,2ndtuenon_220,2013-05-23T07:45Z,"...Back in my day we didnt call the internet, the internet... we called it an onion. Now not any normal run of the mill kind of an onion, like you whippersnappers have nowadays... REAL onions, thats what we had... but not many... due to the war you see... anyway, that was our internet back then. The important thing was we tied an onion to our belt, as was the fashion of the day.... ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz



Yeah, so if you read that, then well... please be more selective of the time you have left. Wasting away seconds reading crap is counterproductive & not at all informative.
So please, next time you feel the need to bombard comments sections with go nowhere points & utterly moronic outbursts... please think of the children & simply hit yourself in the head with a frying pan for an hour instead.
Only thing that should be offered over is a quality check from those who have D/L the file. The rest .... well... its kind of like this post. Namely surplus to needs.
I would ""borrow"" more from the internet if more actual informative feedback was put forward by those who had already ""borrowed"". But time & time again I simply PASS on content due to it being littered with the ramberlings of the idiots of the world.

Ok... so anyway, as I was saying.

Wait!. Where did everybody go?. ;)

Are you going to say the same thing about each upload about Star Trek: Into Darkness?
WARNING: don't listen to michaelrwatson.

How about you? Have you uploaded anything as of yet?

Thank you, J.R.Dobbs for uploading."

You are an asshole, your wife, kids, neighbours and co-workers hate you.
Your dog ran away!
Your mother gave you up for adoption, she was smart.
The world has no place for someone like you, she should of put you in a sack with a rock and thrown you in a river.
You're using up vital air that the sick and old people need.
Go kill yourself."
