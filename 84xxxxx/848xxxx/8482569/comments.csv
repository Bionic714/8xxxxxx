,VassilisA,2013-05-17T12:47Z,Sad day... Thanks though!
,BringerOfTheBacon,2013-05-17T18:55Z,Awesome quality for an awesome finale. 
,VLobster,2013-05-18T00:23Z,"I actually stopped watching during season 8 but the finale was definitely worth watching nevertheless :D

thanks for the fast upload eztv - good quality as always!"
,PookaHookah,2013-05-19T04:14Z,"Why would you stop watching during season 8 and then just watch the series finale? That's stupid. Even if your excuse is ""Steve Carell left the show"" it's still a lame excuse. A true fan sticks with it all the way through."
,sickwrists,2013-05-19T17:01Z,"Yeah it takes a true genius to watch every episode of a show and share their thoughtless, inconsequential opinions of other people's preferences.

Thanks, EZTV, for providing this service."
,ojgdf,2013-05-20T03:04Z,"Thank you very much, EZTV. Btw, are you going to upload the upcoming season of Arrested Development? Thanks again."
