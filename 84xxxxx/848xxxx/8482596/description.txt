Hey guys if you want help make the download faster heres an awesome little trick, If you have any of the episodes that look like the ones i uploaded you are welcome to put them in the current folder of the episodes you downloading from me and a window will pop up and ask if you want to replace the files with the ones in the location (If this does happen you know the files are the same). Secondly you will need to force a file check in you torrent downloader (some do this automatically). The logic behind this is you wouldnt download the files you already have and you will end up seeding those files helping me and others which means you will be able to download the files you didnt have a lot faster.

Please note:
This doesnt mean you will download faster than the service youre paying for from your local ISP. (Torrents arent magic)
This does really work!
I will also always try to use the same type of recording eg FoV LOL AFG KILLERS ASAP and so on....
If you dont understand dont bother its an option! 

And for those of you that actually did this I would like to thank you for helping
Enjoy Pirates ;)
