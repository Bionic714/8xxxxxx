,shinehigh247,2013-05-24T15:34Z,"Alright, I messed up.  I D/Led one of these next launcher updates and when I opened the app, it told me that it didn't verify with the play store.  I ran lucky patcher, and ran a patch on it. Oops.  It's showing up under Settings>Applications, as well as in my lucky patcher menu..but that's it.  I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it, but still can't access the file.

Not being able to say which patch I used (I know, dumb move), does anybody have any suggestions for me to get my next launcher back? Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance."
