Few Kings can claim to have moonlit as film directors, but Cambodia's King Father Norodom Sihanouk directed over a dozen feature films and several shorts during his lifetime. Running the gamut from romantic melodramas to political thrillers to screwball comedies to fantasy horror, his movies capture the ever shifting landscape of 20th century Cambodia. This first volume includes seven of his most famous works:

Apsara
The Rose of Bokor
Shadow Over Angkor
La Joie de Vivre
Twilight
See Angkor and Die
The Last Days of Colonel Savath

Most of these films (with the exception of Apsara) are ripped from low-quality VHS transfers, and the English subtitles are barely legible for some, but these films are of historic importance to both cinephiles and historians.

As always please seed at least what you take so that this torrent will live forever, thank you!
