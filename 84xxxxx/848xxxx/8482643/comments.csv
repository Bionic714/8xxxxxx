I was hoping this was actually a torrent for ""The Name of the Doctor""... but 0 seeders and 7 leechers doesn't make me want to waste my time.  I'll be able to get a WEB-DL of the episode by the time I'd have a chance of downloading this one!"

I still must confess that I don't see the benefit of ""upscaling"" a DVD (or VHS) rip... can anyone enlighten me?"
