description:

This is a philosophical introduction to Aristotle, and Professor Lear starts where Aristotle himself started. He introduces us to the essence of Aristotle's philosophy and guides us through all the central Aristotelian texts--selected from the Physics, Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics and the biological and logical works. The book is written in a direct, lucid style that engages the reader with the themes in an active and participatory manner. It will prove a stimulating introduction for all students of Greek philosophy and for a wide range of others interested in Aristotle as a giant figure in Western intellectual history.

Review

"As a general introduction to Aristotle for the intellectually curious, it will not be superseded for years to come. Professionals too will find much to excite and stimulate them; occasionally, too, they may find something to infuriate: but that is all to the good." R.J. Hankinson, ISIS
