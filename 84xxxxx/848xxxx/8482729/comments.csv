[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-17T20:58Z,stuck @ 1.4%
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-18T02:19Z,"...Yeah, still stuck here at the same percentage. Is this ""Sineater2"" a regular poster? Clearly not listed as ""trusted"" by TPB according to the data above. Either way, I'll give this one more day, then I'll punt it. I probably have these downloaded already, but I usually grab everything just to make sure I don't miss anything."
,sin__eater2,2013-05-18T06:58Z,"Hey sorry guys I'm on a laptop and shortly after I uploaded it, it died on me. Couldnt charge it till just now so it should be good to go. I'm not a regular uploader but I was tired of waiting to track down Cable & X-Force and Thunderbolts, and once I did I figured I would just save everyone else the trouble. I've done a few collections in the past though, I'm just pretty lazy . Cheers!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-18T13:08Z,d/l's great now. thanks
