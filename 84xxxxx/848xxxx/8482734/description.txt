Well, here we are: the end of a FCUP. (Had to say it!) I've uploaded every First Comics series (sans reprint titles) that I can find with the exception of two, 'Dreadstar' and 'Lone Wolf and Cub', and they are available at good speeds here at TPB:
 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4555571/Dreadstar
 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4817271/Lone_Wolf_and_Cub (this is the Dark Horse collection)

What's left are three issues of a series based on a short-lived cartoon, a few graphic novels and some odds and ends. They are: 

Filmation's Ghostbusters #1-3 (because 'Original Ghostbusters' just wasn't enough ghostbusting)

Lone Wolf & Cub #10 & #12 (original First Comics issues)

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles GN #1-4 (colored collections of early B&W Turtle comics)

Adventures in Oz (collecting the excellent Eric Shanower minis done for First and Dark Horse)

Beowulf GN (adapted by Jerry Bingham)

Mazinger GN (manga, giant-robot)

Munden's Bar Annual #1 (from my 'First Wanted' file - Thanks for the find, BK!)

The Gift - A First Holiday Special (starring various and sundry First characters)

Time^2 - The Epiphany & Time^2 - The Satisfaction of Black Mariah (graphic novels written and illustrated by Howard Chaykin!)


As usual, I've included a .txt file called 'First Missing' AND added a second, 'Eclipse Missing', in preparation for a future upload project. If you have ANY of the scans listed, please contact me at the email included in the files. I'm gonna need all the help I can get for Eclipse, because they published TONNNNNS of shit. So check your drives and discs, forward the list to your digital-hoarder buddies and poke around in the 'Comics' section at those boutique torrent sites that you keep to yourself. THANK YOU!

And dat's dat. As always, thanks to the creative teams and thanks to the original scanners. If you like the books, show it by keeping the torrents alive!
