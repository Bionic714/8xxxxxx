uTorrent 2.0.4 for Windows with buit-in 246 country flags, also patched to resolve country for non-geographic and alike domains including dotless names.

In other words, it will display flags for all countries in 100% cases (both for IP and reverse DNS peers) and doesn't require any updates at all. This is the final version on 2013, no more improvements planned. If it cannot display a flag, the problem is on the DNSBL site.

You can seed it with itself.

Usage:
  * Set peer.resolve_country = true in Advanced Options.
  * Throw out flags.conf and flags.bmp to hell. Built-in flags forever!
  * Learn geography :-)

Changes from the version with 242 flags+:
  * Added flags of Cura√ßao, Guernsey, Jersey, Sint Maarten and South Sudan.
  * Added list of two-letter domains treated as non-geographic, see below.
  * Dotless names like "localhost" or "none" now are non-geographic too.
  * Changed flag of Libya.
  * Removed flags of Antilles and European Union as well as the flag of the Soviet Union wasn't added.
