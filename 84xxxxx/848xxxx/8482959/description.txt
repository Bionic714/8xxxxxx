If you like Paul Bley's trios when they get purely improvisational, you will
find a similar yet personally distinct version here. Kikuchi develops
remarkably fluid line-crafting, Thomas Morgan has much of a pointillistic role
that he plays quite effectively, and Paul Motian drums with the subtle freedom
of which he was so excellent and original a practitioner in this kind of
setting. Farewell Paul Motian. You will be missed. But hello Masabumi
Kikuchi. May you continue these explorations!
