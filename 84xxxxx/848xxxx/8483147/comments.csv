[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-17T16:30Z,"Wow! Randi packed into one file instead of 3.
Even her commercial-free podcast is in 3 segments.

If only my iPod Touch had a 1 minute skip button it would be easier to navigate through the breaks.
Will download these if I run out of other stuff to listen to. Thanks agian."
[T],480v,2013-05-17T18:36Z,"the reason these aren't worked on is because I stopped listening to randi for awhile now.

I got these because I was curious to hear Randi's opinion about the AP story and if she was going to address other issues. I still haven't heard them yet. I haven't had the time.

But since I had them...why not upload?

I'll say one thing about Randi. She is the most popular liberal talker...that's for sure. She gets downloaded more than anyone even with commercials. By comparison, John Nichols hosting Ed has been downloaded only once so far. Which I think is a shame. That show had substance. he talked about other important issues, not just the AP scandal which I assume is probably the only thing Randi talked about. "
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-17T21:00Z,"Actually Thom Hartmann is the most popular liberal talker, and not only on the radio but on Free Speech TV as well.  So he's seen by more than anyone else.

Ed Schultz remains my favorite though.

I haven't heard much about the Associated Press scandal yet, although I read the article on what President Obama had to say about it."
