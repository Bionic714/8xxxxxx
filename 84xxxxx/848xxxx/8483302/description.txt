One of the worldΓÇÖs leading philosophers offers aspiring thinkers his personal trove of mind-stretching thought experiments.
 Over a storied career, Daniel C. Dennett has engaged questions about science and the workings of the mind. His answers have combined rigorous argument with strong empirical grounding. And a lot of fun.
 Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking offers seventy-seven of DennettΓÇÖs most successful "imagination-extenders and focus-holders" meant to guide you through some of lifeΓÇÖs most treacherous subject matter: evolution, meaning, mind, and free will. With patience and wit, Dennett deftly deploys his thinking tools to gain traction on these thorny issues while offering readers insight into how and why each tool was built.
 
Alongside well-known favorites like OccamΓÇÖs Razor and reductio ad absurdum lie thrilling descriptions of DennettΓÇÖs own creations: Trapped in the Robot Control Room, Beware of the Prime Mammal, and The Wandering Two-Bitser. Ranging across disciplines as diverse as psychology, biology, computer science, and physics, DennettΓÇÖs tools embrace in equal measure light-heartedness and accessibility as they welcome uninitiated and seasoned readers alike. As always, his goal remains to teach you how to "think reliably and even gracefully about really hard questions."
 
A sweeping work of intellectual seriousness thatΓÇÖs also studded with impish delights, Intuition Pumps offers intrepid thinkersΓÇöin all walks of lifeΓÇödelicious opportunities to explore their pet ideas with new powers.
