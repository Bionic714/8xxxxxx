Book Description:

With 100 recipes for teen and family favorites such as Pizza, Mac 'n' Cheese, Grilled Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, Almond Streusel Coffee Cake, and more, Cooking for Your Gluten-Free Teen proves that teens and their families donΓÇÖt have to sacrifice on foods, flavor, or convenience to eat gluten free.

Sarah Berghoff McClure practically grew up in the kitchens of ChicagoΓÇÖs historic Berghoff Restaurant, where wheat-filled German-American favorites such as schnitzels, spaetzles, strudels, and rye bread are staples. When Sarah was diagnosed with Celiac disease, she thought her days of eating her favorite pizzas, pastas, and pastries with her friends were over. Her mother, Carlyn Berghoff, chef/owner of the Berghoff Restaurant, stepped in, and together, she and Sarah began creating gluten-free versions of kid and teen-friendly foods that Sarah could enjoy.

Cooking for Your Gluten-Free Teen offers a unique perspective on living gluten-free from not only someone living with gluten-intolerance, but also from a parent who is also a chef, and a doctor, Susan Nelson, who specializes in treating teens and others with Celiac disease.

ΓÇóCarlyn sets up a gluten-free kitchen checklist and gives tips on how the whole family can switch to gluten-free eating and loving it.

ΓÇó Sarah discusses what itΓÇÖs like to grow up with Celiac disease, as well as how to live a healthy gluten-free lifestyle without feeling singled out at parties or when eating out, and without missing out on the foods teens love.

ΓÇóDr. Nelson discusses the symptoms and diagnosis of Celiac disease and gluten intolerance and tells stories about her patients, who tested and resoundingly approved the recipes in the book.

Cooking for Your Gluten-Free Teen is filled with more than 100 recipes and helpful tips on everything from the top foods that gluten-intolerant teens crave, to converting family favorite recipes to make them gluten-free, as well as strategies for packing healthy and delicious lunches and snacks.

Straightforward tables and lists of naturally gluten-free foods, gluten-laden foods to avoid, and secret sources of gluten are also included, as is a take-along game plan for kids and adults when they are out and about. With teen and family favorites such as Pizza and Mac 'n' Cheese, Grilled Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries, Almond Streusel Coffee Cake, and more, Cooking for Your Gluten-Free Teen proves that teens and their families donΓÇÖt have to sacrifice to eat gluten free.
