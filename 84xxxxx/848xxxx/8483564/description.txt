The Fourth Edition of Computer Organization and Design focuses on the revolutionary change taking place in industry today: the switch from uniprocessor to multicore microprocessors. This emphasis on parallelism is supported by updates reflecting the newest technologies, with examples highlighting the latest processor designs and benchmarking standards. The MIPS processor is the core used to present the fundamentals of hardware technologies, assembly language, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory hierarchies and I/O. Sections on the ARM and x86 architectures are also included.
