,KCCHIEF,2013-06-02T19:39Z,"This is a great version but.......  I tried using several Keys I have, every one of which is legit, not blacklisted, and straight from stickers.  I have literally dozens of good keys, so I am wondering why none of them will work.  Also how does someone contact Ultrasaurus to donate?"
