,tigo123,2013-05-18T12:01Z,"Murphy, can you make a Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 with Office 2010 Professional Plus ?"
,kicsikekincse,2013-05-18T12:40Z,"Thank you for your work Murphy78.

Do I understand the Installation Indexes correctly: there is an activated and a not activated version of the package (win7 + office)? "
,Nomadzx,2013-05-18T16:49Z,"Mr murphy78,

This version can be installed from a Pendrive USB without making any changes? Right?

Thank you so much, you are the boss!"
[V],murphy78,2013-05-19T04:19Z,"kic, yes the normal index is for future use. For instance, say MS comes along and does something that blocks the KMS Server Service in the activated index. Then if that happens, it would be worse to use it than not. You could always use a newer kms solution if something like that happens.  It's unlikely for Win7 since they failed so hard at kb971033, but you never know...

on the pendrive issue... I think you mean a flash drive? I've never called them a pendrive, but I'll assume that... Yes, the main point of adding usb3 support to the boot sector was to enable installation using newer motherboards on newer usb drives...

Technically with Enterprise, it should have absolutely no problems using a usb hard drive to install as well.."
,Nomadzx,2013-05-19T14:09Z,"Thank you for replying murphy78, 

Do you plan to do the same with the Ultimate version?
Why have you chosen the enterprise version this time?"
