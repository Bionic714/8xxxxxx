CPLEX Optimization Studio speeds development and deployment of optimization models, combining leading  solver engines with a tightly integrated IDE and modeling language. Speed development and deployment of optimization models, using linear/quadratic, mixed integer, and constraint programming and constraint-based scheduling. Ensure reliable development and maintenance using a transparent modeling language and intuitive tools for model testing, profiling, and tuning.

 * Solving with mathematical programming: Complete access to a powerful MP solver through the IDE, API, or via third party applications.
 * Solving with constraint programming: Access to an outstanding and proven CP solver as well, through     the IDE, API, or via third party applications.
 * Modeling: Create optimization models and extend optimization algorithms using the OPL modeling  language, the ILOG Concert APIs, or numerous other interfaces and connectors.
 * Developing: Develop, debug, test, and tune analytical decision support applications.    
 * Deploying: Deploy analytical decision support applications.

Disclaimer:
I did not crack this, and have nothing to do with the binaries within this torrent. I cannot (dont know how to) use this software, so i can't really check it. I just found it, and i am posting this here for all to enjoy.
Someone please comment on the validity, quality and safety of these binaries.
