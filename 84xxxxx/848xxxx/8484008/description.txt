Football Manager is the best-selling, most realistic football mana
gement series ever made. Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years
of games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an
array of new features
This year's version allows you to take control of any club in more
than 50 nations across the world and includes all of Europe's biggest
leagues as well as database of over 500,000 real-world players and
staff
As well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are
now new ways to enjoy your Football Manager experience
The 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything
on the pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the players's
movement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air
We've also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel
more realistic and we've made the whole experience more televisual
by introducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final
whistle

The Football Manager Editor is a powerful application that allows the
user to modify the Football Manager 2013 game database. You can now
edit and create competitions
