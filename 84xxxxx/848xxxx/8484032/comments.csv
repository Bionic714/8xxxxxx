,YFNShyne-Box,2013-05-18T08:43Z,"@ OnlyByTheRain -- Is this anything like Alchemist Windows 7, is it from the same creator or team?

I used that OS (Win7 Alchemist) for a year and it was booting and shutting down/restarting faster and I had no issues. Here is the link for Win7ALC: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7103866/Windows7_SP1_Ultimate_64bit_Alchemist_2012_ACTIVATED

I have also checked out the website:  http://www.reckonsteam.com -- I am very impressed and interested in this Windows 8 Evolution OS.

What do they mean that the ribbon has been disabled. What ribbon? The one in File Explorer along the top? Is the Metro screen still available for users or is it gone.

ps Thanks for the upload! Good Work! ;-)"

I agree with you. This is NOT Windows 8, it's a misguided attempt to glorify Windows 7.

Remove the Ribbon? 
It's no longer Windows 8, it's now Windows 8 Retarded.

Why not just leave the option to minimize the ribbon untouched. Why are you de-evolving?

There are some really user-friendly tweaks, like the right-click Shell option to Power; Shutdown, Restart, Lock, etc..

But removing the Ribbon is not progress, it is regression, denying technology.  It would have been nice if Nishant had left the option to minimize it intact instead.

Otherwise, I am sure that this is a very well done Tweaked version of Micrsoft Software. For now, I think I'll stick with Microsoft's Version of Their Operating System, thanks."
,OnlyByTheRain,2013-05-19T11:57Z,don't tell stories be Practicle Prove that it's a win 7 not win 8 ok
