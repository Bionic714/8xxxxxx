 V3nom you should have said ""Download,seed,comment & Enjoy only if you have favorable comment otherwise go f yourself."""

,Inpuris,2013-05-24T04:04Z,"Thank you, V3nom for all your hard work and great uploads.

I suppose some people just like to bitch about...well, anything.  If there's nothing REAL to bitch about they clearly just make something up.  It appears your torrent doesn't offer them famous enough authors for the price they are paying to download ALL THESE E-BOOKS.

Wait, what??  It's free you say?  Clearly a sharp tongue is no indication of a keen mind."
