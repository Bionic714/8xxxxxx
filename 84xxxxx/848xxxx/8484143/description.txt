Playing blu-rays with VLC used to work fine for me with VLC 2.0, but now it doesn't work anymore either because I've updated VLC to 2.05 or because I've updated Mac OS X to Mountain Lion - strange. Never change a winning team. Please bear in mind that with the exception of MakeMKV and handbrake AFAIK these programs all require an internet connection to get access to a blu-ray decryption library on a remote server which is rather annoying. I've checked all files with my updated anti-virus software. If something goes wrong: sue me ;-) Some PDF help-files are included. My recommendations: For ripping use MakeMKV, for playing use VLC 2.0. Check them out. This should keep you occupied you for a while ;-) seed seed seed - seeding makes the world go round - and sharing means caring - comments are welcome - express yourself
