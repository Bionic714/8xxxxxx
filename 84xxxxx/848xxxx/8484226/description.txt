Files are named via TheTVDB.com for my XBMC if you don't like it rename them.

My upload speed is slow so give it some time, be patient, and SEED!

Be sure to not limit your upload speed during initial seeding so I don't have to seed much more than 100% to get the torrent self sustaining. It would help me and you out a lot.

--SERIES--
All Uncut personal DVD Box Sets. I did these a while ago and should of used Detelecine instead of a Deinterlace filter to remove interlacing. You will notice some aliacing around the mouths when they talk and stuff like that. My bad I was a noob about it at the time.
