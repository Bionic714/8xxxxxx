For almost a decade, Bristol's Tectonic has been the go-to label for gloomy, bass-heavy dubstep variants, and although in 2013 the scene has either been co-opted by the US EDM movement or diluted by a trend towards housier sounds, Pinch's influential imprint is ready to show us all how healthy the scene still is.

For the fourth installment of the label's regular Tectonic Plates series, we're very fairly treated to representatives from both sides of the Atlantic. US bass dons Distal, Pursuit Grooves, Sinistarr and Texel shine a light on the section of the US scene that gets little or no coverage, and holding it down for the UK are Bristol lynchpin Jakes appearing, Joker cohort Guido, Kryptic Minds, Armour, drum 'n bass producer Steve Digital, Mumdance and Logos and Beneath.
