,T-Kid,2013-05-21T12:17Z,"Ok, I was completely amped up for this game when I heard about it. I did pre-order it, but my funds were low so I had to cancel on the pre-order, and damn am I glad that I did. This game is utter crap. It really is, and I wish I didn't have to give such a negative review of it. I couldn't play beyond twenty minutes, it was so bad. So outside of the graphics being piss poor. And I really do mean piss poor. This games graphics are maybe on par with Ps2, which is sad for a 360 game late in the 360's life, what with the new xbox being announced later today. Anyway, crap graphics, then there's the matter of the driving engine itself. This game wouldn't be so bad if they took the driving engine from the arcade fast and furious games. No, I honestly think they made one in about a week and thought it worked fine. Driving a muscle car, handling is expected to not be the greatest, but yo at least have the bonus of extra car mass on your side due to it being a muscle car, which typically has a lot of weight to it. This game defies logic in that matter where instead of having shit handling but being able to take damage, you instead have TERRIBLE handling, and even the tiniest piece of crap import car can barely bump you and launch you off the road. So all in all, my advice to anyone thinking about getting this game. RENT IT...DON'T EVEN WASTE A DISC BURNING IT LIKE I DID. I honestly regret using up one of my verbatim's on this game."
