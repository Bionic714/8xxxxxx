The two leave, promising to return during the monsoon season. While in the city, Pran is unable to make up his mind about returning to Reshma, and Gopal prefers the company of two dancing girls, Lily and Ruby, not knowing that Reshma is shortly to be married to Bholu, while Neela, on the verge of killing herself, is anxiously awaiting Gopal's return.
