The most underrated comedy on pathetic imdb, people forget it's a comedy for God's sake!
Uma Thurman is fantastic, she's the sexy, lanky star of the Kill Bill movies, don't miss it!
Thos who don't appreciate it as a comedy should visit a psychiatrist or a guru.

In Manhattan, a mother of two preparing for her daughter's sixth birthday party has no idea of the challenges she's about to face in order to pull off the event.
