1)  Colonel Fawcett's Dream 
A trip to the past where man's steps are trailed who in 1925 suddenly disappeared in the jungles of Brazil and then never turned up. Only his name - Percy Fawcett - was saved for history. His ultimate dream: to find El Dorado. An almost obsessive belief in the existence of the legendary golden city drove the English colonel to the villages of Xingu Indians and made his expedition a true myth.
