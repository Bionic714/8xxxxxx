As humanity evolves, so must power evolve. In The Art of Power, the eminent Thich Nhat Hanh presents us with a radically new vision of power for the coming age. True power, he declares, is spiritual. While the idea of spiritual power is profoundly simple, we live in an age where power is still understood as violent and dominating and spirituality is often conflated with religion and dogma. As human institutions - both institutional and interpersonal - disintegrate and decay all around us based on these outmoded and dysfunctional definitions, we are beginning to ask ourselves, "What next??" In simple, accessible, and sensitive language suitable for a wide range of readers, Thich Nhat Hanh answers this question.

Bringing his well-known "engaged Buddhism" to bear upon problems of contemporary society - from relationships, sex, and family, to business, politics, and the environment - he offers simple, straightforward practices for transforming the energy of power in real-life situations. In addition to explaining the Four Noble Truths in plain language, he presents the Five Spiritual Powers, the Five Mindfulness Teachings, and ten concrete practices to strengthen power and spiritual energy. In lively and unpretentious prose, he masterfully interweaves Zen philosophy and stories from the life of Buddha (as well as some of Buddha's lesser-known associates) with examples from his own life and the lives of others with whom he has worked in recent years. We observe how, paradoxically, impermanence, nonself, interbeing, and mindfulness form the foundation of the very peace, happiness, freedom, and prosperity we all seek on individual and collective levels. Thus, ancient wisdom finds contemporary relevance for everyone, from housewives (and househusbands) to corporate visionaries and heads of state.

Thich Nhat Hanh is quietly one of the most powerful people on Earth today. He walks gently, intently, lovingly, and consciously in every step. He models the power of which he speaks. With this book, all can follow in his footsteps and tread a similar path.
