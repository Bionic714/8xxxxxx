This man is not just for Canadians he is for the whole world.  Take some time to look at the rest of his videos on You Tube.  

He got people excited about space travel and science again.  His life and accomplishments show what it means to have character.

Abandon despair an negativity.  Embrace ambition and hard work in becoming a better person and better at what ever it is that you do.  One great example in Commander Hadfield.
