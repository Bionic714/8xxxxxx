Not bad for voiceover dubbing. There are worse out there.

Say, junoon is there some way of fiddling with VLC to mute or reduce the English audio track? I don't want it to interfere with the Russian track that I want to hear. It defeats the purpose of studying Russian with constant English chatter in the background."
[T],junoon,2013-05-19T02:11Z,only professional dubbing (no voice over) will help.

I like your stuff -- especially the small file sizes. It's unfortunate there are not more professionally dubbed films out there. Sometimes it's better just to listen to the English audio and read the Russian subtitles. But, we take what we can get. Between you and [mkvonly] the selection is actually pretty good."
