ROCK BOOK VOLUME II: DARK SIDE OF THE MOON

Set to the music and lyrics and music of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, this is the story of Theodore the disenfranchised rabbit; working tirelessly on the moon to dig a hole from one side to the other to let the sun through; playing in a mundane rock band and having sex rampantly but without much zest.
