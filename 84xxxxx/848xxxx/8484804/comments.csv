Some pronunciation, some vocabulary, some romance and a little bit of horror-movie gore in this episode.

Hi everyone, I decided to teach you some essential language this time. Here's what to expect from this episode: 
The first part is about the pronunciation of ~ed endings (e.g. agED, beggED or wastED, etc) 
The second part involves some -ed adjectives. 
Then I teach you some idioms and very natural expressions. 
The episode also includes a romantic story with sentences you can repeat, and a little bit of horror movie violence, just in case you were bored of all the 'romance'.

For vocabulary notes, see below.

You can make donations here. It's my birthday next Wednesday. Just saying... "

In this episode:

1. I'll tell you a bit about hip hop, and its history, but not too much because I don't want to bore you.

2. We'll listen to some hip hop and have a look at the lyrics and analyse them. I'll explain them, and kind of give you my thoughts on them.

There is music in the background on this one. I thought it was appropriate because of the subject of this episode. Future episodes will not always have music, but this one does. If you really can't hear what I'm saying then let me know and I might be able to upload this episode again without the background music. If you like the music and would like to hear more, let me know by commenting on this episode. I should be able to recommend some albums or tracks for you.
