Having two of them on a show probably was a kiss of death. The fact that it lasted two seasons was a testament to the cast, and especially to producer Desi Arnaz, who gave it just as much care and effort as he did with Lucy for eight seasons. And no, I have no idea who Desi was fracking in the dressing room for this particular show :P"

the time he worked on this series. Whether he was cheating on his second wife at the time I don't know.
There wasn't anything about that in the Desilu biography of the two stars that I recently read."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-19T04:00Z,"According to the Desilu book, The Mothers In Law ratings during the first year weren't that great -- it was never in the Top 20.  NBC was going to cancel it, but as was the case with The Jerry Lewis Show during those same two years, the network gave it a second season in 1968.  Arnaz convinced them it was worth that much."
