Produced by Marshall Altman, How Mercy Looks from Here is Amy Grant's first full studio album in ten years. Grant wrote all but one of the songs for the set, which features guest spots from James Taylor, Carole King, Sheryl Crow, Eric Paslay, Will Hoge, and Grant's husband Vince Gill, and the songs glow with the gentle redemptive wisdom that is her strong point as a songwriter and singer.
