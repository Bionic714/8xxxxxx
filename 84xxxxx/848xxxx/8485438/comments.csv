,wildpig1234,2013-05-18T08:04Z,Thank you so much ;).  We finally got the 80s revival on here.  I am almost done with the first season ;)
,wildpig1234,2013-05-19T07:46Z,"if you want, you can consolidate all the 88 season episodes into 1 torrent and then delete the multiple earlier torrents.  All of us already got the files, so you won't be really reseeding it as we would all just download the new torrent and copy the old files over to seed.

Thanks again.

,russell887,2013-05-20T01:41Z,The thing with that though is on this site you can't edit or delete torrents...I've already tried deleting one with no luck!! :(
,wildpig1234,2013-05-21T12:59Z,"when you are logged in, go to the page of an individual torrent, there should be a small red x at the upper right corner to delete.  Try that."
,russell887,2013-05-22T05:01Z,That's what I did and the torrent failed to delete...I can't delete or edit.
