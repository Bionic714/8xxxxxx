This is a basic Camrip and not even an R6 ""Line"" which would mean a DVD source from China- region 6. Camera codes are as followed. Its either going to be PAL or NTSC for the types of camera used. Cameras are not labeled in regions. Just letting you know before you download that this new stupid labeling system that people are following are false and they are only using it for people to download their torrents. Again this is a camrip with an audio rating of about 7 and video 4 because it is a rip. "

For TvTeam could you please stop posting torrents without some explanation of what the torrent is about. The time you take o post your site info is the same it would take to inform the downloader of what the video is about. Even a simple IMDB link would help."

Thanks for your information below it is appreciated. "
,maddog7777,2013-05-18T18:29Z,"Your welcome! 
I personally want them to stop labeling things that there not! I say just because someone else does not know how to label something doesn't mean they have to too! Another uploader told me he did not want to rename it because it would mislead the people who download it. I said wtf? I said you are misleading people now with this supposed R6""line"" version!!! It is a Camrip and that is it!..LOL He never responded back after that. "
