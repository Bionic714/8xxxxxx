Review
"Jones laces the latest academic research with his own increasingly avuncular humour. Who says history can't be fun? In the hands of Professor Jones, how could it be anything else?" Observer "Jones really knows his subject, he is also a passionate apologist for the Middle Ages... and you also learnt things which made your view of the period a little more complex" Independent "Jones is a reliable and accurate guide to his period, mercifully free from the pomposity that afflicts so many telly historians. Three cheers for Terry Jones" London Evening Standard "Brimming with life, colour, and yes, facts too" Daily Telegraph
