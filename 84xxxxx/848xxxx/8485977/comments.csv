,alternate_z11,2013-05-19T03:54Z,"Actually, due to Apple's App Store security, you can download his previous purchases (Raven sword), but not download anything new. If you try, it will request verification on his security questions.

Currently logged in and downloading Ravensword from the App Store on my Mac. Didn't disturb anything else on the account. He doesn't have a credit card, just 2.23 dollars of credit. 

Spencer, you should change your account info though. It's not safe giving it out like that. Nevertheless, thanks for the game :)"
