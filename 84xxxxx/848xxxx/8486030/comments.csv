,Mikey320,2013-05-19T02:58Z,Here is english subs just for Russian parts! Enjoy http://subscene.com/subtitles/a-good-day-to-die-hard/english/731767
,Albe_Sure,2013-06-11T12:10Z,"Typically, I abhor subtitles...but as I don't speak Russian fluently, I needed to do just a few minutes of research to get this working on my Samsung Blu-ray player (connected via USB to an external HD) and my PS3...

So, for anyone who isn't readily familiar with the process, a movie file (such as the quality anoXmous share provided here) may be optionally be played WITH subtitles by changing the name of a given .srt file to the EXACT same name as the movie file (minus extension).  Often times external subtitle file(s) may be included along with the orig share (such as is the case with this share by anoXmous) or can be downloaded separately.

So, in short:
1) locate the external .srt source file you wish to use
2) re-name that file to the SAME exact name as the movie file (minus the filetype extension, that will remain .srt)
3) place that file into the SAME folder as the movie file

NORMALLY English subs may be hard-coded (forced without a choice) into an English produced film (such as this one)...but that is not the case here.

While I have not (yet) tested this fully myself, as Milkey320 kindly provided above, the English subs for just the Russian parts may be downloaded found at:

Hopefully the above information will help SOMEONE out there (who may totally not be a techno idiot, but just hand't much need to implement subtitles in a digital file to this point...such as was the case with me.)

All the best!
