[code]ItΓÇÖs a HUGE EBOOK COLLECTION of vampire books. It is basically every ebook I could find online.  ItΓÇÖs not perfect, but you have a lot to choose from.
Some books probably donΓÇÖt have vampires as the main thing, but if it had vampires at all IΓÇÖve included it. Same thing goes with series, even if one book in the series is focused on vampires, and the others arenΓÇÖt, IΓÇÖve included the whole series because it wouldnΓÇÖt be nice to have the one book, and then have to go searching for the rest.Read More in the [b]'Book List'[/b][/code]
