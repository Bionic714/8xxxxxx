Electrical Circuit Theory and Technology is a fully comprehensive text for courses in electrical and electronic principles, circuit theory and electrical technology. The coverage takes students from the fundamentals of the subject, to the completion of a first year degree level course. Thus, this book is ideal for students studying engineering for the first time, and is also suitable for pre-degree vocational courses, especially where progression to higher levels of study is likely. 

John Bird's approach, based on 700 worked examples supported by over 1000 problems (including answers), is ideal for students of a wide range of abilities, and can be worked through at the student's own pace. Theory is kept to a minimum, placing a firm emphasis on problem-solving skills, and making this a thoroughly practical introduction to these core subjects in the electrical and electronic engineering curriculum.
