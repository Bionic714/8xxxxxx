S01E01
S01E02
S02E10
S01E05
S01E04
S02E09
S02E05
S01E06
S02E12
S01E03
S01E07
S02E06
S02E07

And, after the other 7 unaired eps* are available, I'll be able to do the same with Season 2:
S02E01
S02E04
S02E02
S02E03
S02E08
*S02E14
*S02E13
S02E11
*S02E15
*S02E16
*S02E17
*S02E18
*S02E19

Thank you, mickedee77, for helping us to see this show properly. IMO, this delightful show is likely to have not been cancelled had the overpaid ABC scheduling eejits not done everything they could to ensure its demise."
,Erik_O,2013-05-18T13:18Z,please upload the rest of season 2
,Erik_O,2013-05-18T13:53Z,"thanks, but are u seeding? it's slow as hell?"
,mistergog,2013-05-18T13:54Z,Can you get the rest for us poor suckers that live outside the US (and can't be bothered to connect through a proxy)?
,nicoarg,2013-05-18T16:34Z,Thanks a lot! Wating for the others
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-05-18T16:46Z,"All the episodes are here, just not as torrents.

,LPMA84,2013-05-18T18:45Z,Thanks to the OP and MrUnpopular for the rest of them! I've streamed the first few but I wanted to save them somewhere since DVDs are probably unlikely.
[T],theburningbush,2013-05-18T19:08Z,"mickedee77: Now that I've seen your offering, I must reluctantly give it a video rating of 1/10. With both WMP and VLC, it plays as if every other frame has been removed.

MrUnpopular: WOW! Thanks for your info re: UNPOPULAR. So far I've gotten S02E12, and it looks fine to me.

Correct-order viewing marathon, here I come!"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-05-18T20:36Z,@theburningbush You're welcome. The framerate was left the same as the copy downloaded off the web and everything else was pretty much left untouched video wise. Simply encoded it to crf19 and that's about it. :)
,AVerd,2013-05-18T22:41Z,Thank you very much MrUnpopular. Appreciate it.
,jharbert78,2013-05-19T01:40Z,"@ Mr Unpoular, not sure if its me but I cant access the links for episodes 12-15. I keep trying, am I doing something wrong?"

,DJ_APC,2013-05-24T23:45Z,"mickedee77: I don't want to come across as a complete dunderhead but I will ask regardless

I have recently found out that there are NEW eps not yet released on TV but are now becoming available.  I am very keen in seeing them but I am not 100% sure what is being posted here, (ie: old releases renamed, or brand new unreleased episodes) - can you clarify in your text if these are new episodes you are posting??

It seems to me that a lot of the DTTBIA23 files about to be uploaded are going to fill in the gaps of what can only be described as piss poor scheduling (ie: eps out of order) but I want to ensure I am D/Ling the NEW ones, not old ones I already have seen just renamed - hope that makes sense

Cheers in advance.

And if you are posting the new ones - Thank you, thank you, thank you
:)"
