Diablo 2 Classic + LoD Clean,here's whats included:

1 - Install    Disk
2 - Play       Disk
3 - Cinematics Disk
4 - Expansion  Disk

5 - LoD Patch v1.10  (For Nezeramontias MOD,highly recommended)
6 - L0D Patch v1.13d (For unchanged playing experience from blizzard,latest patch)

7 - Nezeramontias 1.09 MOD: (Comes in separate file,you choose if to install or not)
  - Great MOD (best in my perspective)which gives you:
  - 750 Level Cap.
  - All Monsters get higher levels at each difficulty.
  - More new monsters,new skills,new items,among which new item type called "Soul", which
nearly all monsters drop and which you can equip in the ring slot. Those souls give you abilities of monsters that dropped them.
  - Many more changes, but the overall gameplay remains the same,you still enjoy LOD.

8 - Daemon Tools Lite - Tool to mount .iso images
 
Enjoy, and let others enjoy as well. SEED. )
