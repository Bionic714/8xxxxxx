Book Description:

Ten years ago, six-year-old Catalina Mateo hid under the porch of her family home while a knife butchered her mother and a bullet killed her father.
Now, a rough-sleeping orphan, Cat arrives at the house of Detective Jonathan Stride, pleading for protection. Covered in blood and drenched in the icy waters of Lake Superior, she claims to have narrowly escaped a cold-blooded killer.

StrideÆs raw instinct is to protect Cat, whose late parentsÆ case û and his personal guilt associated with it û still sends a shiver down his spine. As a result, he takes the troubled teenager under his wing without as much as a second thought.

However, StrideÆs partner Maggie Bei is not convinced. She doubts the sincerity of this beautiful young streetwalker who has so easily won StrideÆs trust, and now sleeps in his house with a butcherÆs knife under her pillow.
As Stride continues to care for Cat, MaggieÆs suspicions solidify, and a single question occupies the void between them: should Stride be afraid for, or of, this terribly damaged girl?
