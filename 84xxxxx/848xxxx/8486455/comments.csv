3) The Harrier & The Black Arrow Rocket
Peter Snow meets the two designers of the Harrier Jump Jet also he tells the story of the inventors of the little known ˜Black Arrow, a satellite launching rocket. Back in the heady days of the mid 20th century, there was a growing feeling among British astrophysicists that they had as good a shot at space exploration as America or the USSR did, provided they could secure the funding. The usual Whitehall wrangle ensued, and a relatively small amount of money (Â£9m) was set aside for the so-called Black Arrow project, which would aim to build a cleverly powered launch device for satellites.
