SorrowΓÇÖs electronic, beats-driven music floats above the furthest reaches of Ambient Dubstep, propelled aloft by a dubbed out, sonorous Garage hybrid of his own invention.

A series of self-released tracks, remixes and EPs over the last two years, as well as collaborations with other artists (including Stumbleine, Asa and Submerse) have rapidly earned him a profile as one of the UKΓÇÖs rising producers.

True to his moniker, SorrowΓÇÖs music has an underlying current of melancholy, with mournful strings and piano and ghostly vocals, but he balances the mood artfully with head-bobbing beats and a wonky sense of humour that emerges unexpectedly here and there.

In Dreamstone, the lush strings and languid zig-zag beats of Embrace flow into the Bossa Nova lounge of Maelys, which in turn yields to the darker, more experimental tones of Supernova.

From the chilled out ambience of Dalliance, featuring the sultry guest vocals of CoMa, to the restless, more aggressive beats of Intruder, Dreamstone works equally well for late night sonic explorations or laid-back Sunday mornings.
