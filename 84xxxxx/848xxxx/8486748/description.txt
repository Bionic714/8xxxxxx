A skeptic's guide to debunking popular science myths and much "received wisdom" that is just plain wrong
Accessible, clear, and humorous, this book answers questions people have pondered over for a lifetime, such as: Why did your mother remind you to take off your coat when inside, or you won't "feel the benefit" when you leave? Why would someone advise that what you need to cool down is a nice cup of tea? And must you really let red wine breathe first to improve its taste? It also covers why urinating on a jellyfish sting does not help, why cellphones won't give you cancer, and why recycling aluminum cans is not a waste of time. With clear and witty writing, this book examines the science behind many popular myths, revealing why many "truths" we think we know, we don't really know at all.
