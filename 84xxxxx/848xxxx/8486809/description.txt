Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid is a Japanese anime film based on Hans Christian Andersen's eponymous fairy tale, released in 1975 by Toei Animation. Unlike the later Walt Disney Pictures animated film adaptation released 14 years later, this film is closer to Andersen's original story, notably in its preservation of the original ending. The protagonists are the youngest daughter of the royal Merman family, Marina, and her best friend Fritz, an atlantic dolphin calf.
