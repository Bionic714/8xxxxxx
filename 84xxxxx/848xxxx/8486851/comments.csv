You are the best CHATTCHITTO!!!"
,invisiblemeathead,2013-05-19T04:10Z,"Hey ChattChitto, always enjoy your ups.

I downloaded one of your Camtasia ups and in the installer was some middle eastern music playing - any chance of telling me who the artist was?? Long shot in asking I know but worth a try...thanks again, invisible"
[T],CheckOutEr,2013-05-19T14:20Z,"Dear, ChattChitto!

   I would like to report that ""DVDFab Platinum"" does not exist anymore, just ""DVDFab"". 
   DVDFab recently launched a new angle on their products – keeping prices the same, but removing all the conversion tools from their DVD burning software, selling them as separate units. 
   That's why ""DVDFab v9"" is worse than ""DVDFab Platinum v8"". 
   By now ""DVDFab Platinum"" (which existed earlier and had more functions than today's ""DVDFab"") has been upgraded and renamed to ""DVDFab All-In-One"".

Best regards,
CheckOutEr"

You are mistaken :) all the ""new"" DVDFab's v9 actually are the same product. Check the download links on there site and you will know what I'm talking about. They just renamed them for marketing purposes.
So at the end of the day they are all actually ""DVDFab Platinum""."
[T],CheckOutEr,2013-05-20T01:13Z,"@ChattChitto
Well, I read about DVDFab v9 release from TopTenREVIEWS (DVDFab isn't the 1st anymore, it's 4th :( ), where was written that Fengtao removed all the conversion tools from their DVD burning software and by now is selling them as separate units. Because of the lowered rating by TopTenREVIEWS, because of their review and complaints of the people in the forums and because I couldn't find the word ""Platinum"" anywhere in this program - that's why I taught that it has less functions than previous versions of it. But yes, if such Authority as you, ChattChitto said that I am mistaken then I really am. :) BTW: Thanks for your reply, for everything you do on TPB, but please do not sacrifice your health just because of uploading too much torrents, sometimes take a break, eat well, sleep well, you know ;)"
[V],ChattChitto,2013-05-20T12:34Z,"@CheckOutEr
I might be mistake myself lol I'm not a DVDFab user myself so you might know better if you experienced it :D
and thanks for the nice words :)"
