,cjay2334,2013-05-21T08:25Z,"^^^^^^^^

AMEN!"
,iamlaze,2013-05-21T20:42Z,"WTF. this russian crap! This movie has been out for a while here in the USA, still no camrip or anything WTF. Fast And Furious 6 (english usa cam) was released 6 days before USA release. wtf!!!"
,iamlaze,2013-05-21T20:44Z,cjay2334
,cjay2334,2013-05-22T03:01Z,"@iamlaze i agree. Iron man, star trek, and fast 6 have all come out with cams before the movie hits theaters in U.S. and Gatsby has been out for almost two weeks. I have high hopes for atleast an english version of this cam by the end of the week tho!"
,Kazenako,2013-05-25T11:23Z,"ahahaa. Sad. Russian audio. Russians work faster. But I really wanted to watch it in English. Otherwise I would have watched it in theatre (in translation). 
I hope ppl here read the book. I mean. I'm ukrainian and I've read a book some while ago. And I've read that even americans haven't read a book. Just enjoyed the movie. This is your legacy! ... I guess I went on too much rambling. sorry."
,cjay2334,2013-05-25T22:07Z,English audio anybody?
,yeltsin9,2013-05-26T01:51Z,"I had to login just to reply to @iamlaze

,BigJoe88,2013-05-26T18:22Z,I'm sure theres a torrent site somewhere out there that has an english version floating around... Where is it!?
,cjay2334,2013-05-26T22:29Z,"@BigJoe88 I have looked all over the web, found german, french, and italian rips of Gatsby, yet not one single English rip.  kind of ironic considering that The Great Gatsby is an American Classic..lol"
,trina0301,2013-05-27T03:40Z,"can u please put english subtitles on there. for almost every other language most movies on here they put russian, dutch, swedish, french & spanish. most of the ppl on here speak english.
