,bajungadustin,2013-05-31T05:59Z,"honestly... im not one to gripe about cam quality. i know what i am getting myself into when i download a cam. But whoever filmed this needs to seriously log on to amazon and order a tripod.

A - 5
V - 7 / 2

(when the guy stops dicking with the camera the quality is damn decent and watchable and so i give those parts a 7... but about 20 times during the movie he like picks the camera up.. zooms out.. zooms in... tilts it on its side...  points it at the exit doors... and it one point moves it off the screen almost entirely. Had he have just left the damn thing alone this would have been the best copy out. so i give those scenes a 2.. so on average the video would get i say a 4. )

i mean seriously what the hell was this guy thinking."

,supkids,2013-06-03T19:22Z,"Friggin' hell, it's been forever that we got a good screener or something else that's not a cam. Feels like a year back you used to be able to get tons of movies either pre-release or at least shortly after. Nowadays movies run for weeks before we get a decent rip. Don't get me wrong, i appreciate the work camers do, and that of the people who try to turn cams in to something worth watching, but i just can't shake the feeling the movie industry is finally getting ahead in the fight against pirates. And that makes me one sad puppy, mostly because i live in Shitfuck, Nowhere in Switzneyland, and our tiny cinema either doesn't show lots of good movies, or if they do, they show the german dubbed version. If you ever heard, for example, Al Pacino's german voice you'd understand how frustrating this is - Sag Hallo zu meinem kleine Freund! Shit just don't sound right. End of rant, thank you for your attention."

,jleonard71,2013-06-11T21:12Z,"A/V - both 2-3. Video is very grainy, camera moves around a LOT, audio has a lot of echo. Looks like it was shot with a cell phone cam, and honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it was. 

That being said - it's FREE, it is watchable (barely), and from what I can see there isn't a better copy out there. So you can either watch this knowing that it's not going to be good quality, or go pay $10 to see it in a theater. "
