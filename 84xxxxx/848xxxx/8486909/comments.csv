,pmalbu,2013-05-18T18:17Z,"thanks! great quality (obviously not as good as FLAC, but I have an SSD so can't afford to take up extra room and I'm pretty sure my speakers aren't good enough to portray a different between 320 kbps CBR and FLAC lol).

Great new album, 10/10 in my opinion.
I was waiting so long for this"
