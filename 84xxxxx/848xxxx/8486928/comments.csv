"
,BIG_SPUD,2013-05-19T06:43Z,"for a Cam, this is really really good.  at 1:30, the cam tilts away and loses a bit of the screen, but this only lasts a few seconds.
Audio is echoey, but you can hear it well and a lot better than other cams
Video is awesome for a cam.
overall
A-5  V8
best there is, until it's released on Blue-ray
Thank you .BONE>"
,john416,2013-05-19T19:05Z,"the cam dose move around a lot but the quality is the best cam i have seen the sound is kinda good but i can hear people in the bakgound

,RefOrMe,2013-05-20T05:02Z,Thanks    What about the fight going down the runway?  LOL  
,Ssgtmcnasty,2013-05-22T08:37Z,"Good cam for the most part, but I have to say it YET AGAIN.....if you are going to take a CAM in a theater...TURN....THE FUCKING AUTOFOCUS....OFF!!

Otherwise,

,TRONN3387,2013-05-23T07:48Z,"Great copy A/8 v/8....but was the camera man drunk? wtf did he need to be moving it ALL OVER THE PLACE for? but for a cam, that meing my only complaint...excellent upload! Thanks Bone"
,AVD89,2013-05-23T08:23Z,"V-4
A-8

Video camera Move too much and lost focus few time. This guy need to learn to leave the camera alone during movie."
,IVIodern,2013-05-23T10:00Z,"Not the best, not the worst. Overall around 6-7/10. "
,fast6,2013-05-24T15:43Z,Nice scenario... Nice action.. nice story.. The movie all allong is a 10.. for CAM.. is Watchable.. (nice do). V/6 A/7 For a CAM. overall is a clen /8.. Thanks to the uploader.. very nice job ... Like for you..
,alronayr,2013-05-25T20:37Z,i cant begin to describe how far from watchable this is...are ye all loopers?constantly zooming in and out...someones head just popping in and out...loud laughing and coughing then just cuts off the ending???...dont waste your time 
,Quantumd80,2013-05-25T23:42Z,Lmao at 1:39:12 someone in the theater lets one rip and it echos so you know people heard it lol!!!
,creaturedark,2013-05-26T03:31Z,does this have the after credit ending scene
,etjulprou,2013-05-26T20:47Z,"good but for god sake , stop moving your camera while you film , it's unpleasant . however the sound is excellent "
,synistersoldier,2013-05-27T02:33Z,"Cam is ridiculous shaky, blurs out at the WORST moments.  And I swear someone sitting next to the cam has the plague- they cough all through the movie."
,BIG_SPUD,2013-05-27T04:45Z,"FUck you are whingers. Go and pay to see the movie, with people coughing and moving and everything else, or shut the fuck up and enjoy your FREE version"
,T3knoMan,2013-05-29T22:55Z,Dude this is a CAM?? Sick copy. Awesome. TY BONE
,nani1983,2013-06-01T09:40Z,"very clear for a cam, but of coarse there is always a little blurriness the cam moves sometimes, BUT OVERALL it's very watchable 
A:10
V:5"
,TonyKolia,2013-06-10T20:25Z,"A bit shaky at times but good quality for a cam
V - 7 (for a cam)
S - 6"
,halfchaos,2013-06-11T20:23Z,"A: 7
V: 5

Not bad for a cam. Some parts are blurry and out of focus and the dark scenes are too dark. If you can wait for a better copy then you should wait. It's watchable though if you are impatient."
,halfchaos,2013-06-11T20:39Z,"Thanks bone.
Everyone else here is a free tip; use MPC, options, misc, turn the brightness up to 25 - 30."
