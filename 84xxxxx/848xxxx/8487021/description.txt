GAME INFO:
*********************************************************************
Conquer the ancient world in Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece, a 
 strategic military simulation of some of the era's greatest battles! 
 Experience the full range of warfare, from reconnaissance and raids to 
 massive field battles and mountain blockades as you campaign across a 
 historically accurate map of ancient Greece. Siege and starve your enemy 
 by cutting their supply lines or burning their crops, all while building 
 and protecting your own supply network to support your growing empire. 

 In Hegemony Gold, play as Macedonia, Athens, or Sparta in the game's three 
 historical campaigns, or choose one of the 26 factions in an epic sandbox 
 mode and forge your own empire. With dynamic diplomacy choices and 
 extensive tactical options, Hegemony Gold sets the new standard for 
 ancient warfare strategy games.

 Great to conquer ancient Greece, as you lead Spartan hoplites, Athenian
