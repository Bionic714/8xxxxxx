Dirt Road Trucker 3D lets you take control of a rusty but trusty old truck and deliver cargo on difficult dirt roads. 
Challenge yourself by trying to be as fast as you can, but be careful not to drop any cargo. 
You can compare your results to other players to see if you are the best dirt road trucker out there.
The game features 3 types of controls to steer the truck:
- by tilting your device;
- virtual steering wheel;
- on screen touch pads.
More levels coming soon.
Requires Android: 2.0.1 AND UP
