,Shoobox,2013-05-18T23:14Z,"This is the first time I have ever written anything good about a cam.
Def 7/7
smaller size and better quality than any other out there how they all should be.
Hard coded foreign subs, but because of movie quality very forgivable.


""Why can't all cams be this size and good quality all those other 1gb and over sizes are horrible!!"""

,maddog7777,2013-05-19T06:39Z,"Just letting people know! This is not an R6 line. This is a basic Camrip! The torrent titles was taken offline from some group who does not know the difference between Camrip and R6""line"" source. They concluded that it came from an R6 camera source. Just to break it down in easier terms for you. NO SUCH THING! Camera sources are broken down into two groups PAL and NTSC. Region 6 means China and it did come from China yes! However when you label R6""line"" refers to DVD VideoRip source and this is not.... It is a Cam version only. If you like Cam version, then by all means enjoy DL it. But I want you to know what it is, since they are misleading people just to get them to DL their garbage. "
,warriorkhan,2013-05-19T11:33Z,agree with maddog7777. an R6 should have dvd quality with asian subtitles. this does not look like an R6. it just looks like average looking cam quality.

@maddog7777
Just to let you know that's why I informed people , best cam i have ever seen, if they can't figure that out they shouldn't be downloading at"
,maddog7777,2013-05-19T22:10Z,"Shoobox - That was why I also explained the difference and the true meaning of what an R5 or 6 line should be and not a CamRip. These torrent uploaders are copying and pasting the text from these group forums online that do not know the difference and regional code meanings for DVDrip, Camrips and TS. Like I said, they tried to tell me this came from an R6 camera source.....lmfao... No Such Thing! Cameras are labeled as PAL or NTSC. But we need to keep informing people of the truth and let it be their choice to DL it or not. But falsely mislabeling is only being done so people will DL their torrents. I only gave A5 and V4 is because I do not like Camrip. I do not care if it is the best camrip ever. "
