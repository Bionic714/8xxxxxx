At age 93, Pete Seeger isn't actually retiring, just slowing down a bit. He's doing fewer concerts and his voice is a bit wobbly, but his heart is still open and his mind is still sharp. If you need proof, listen to the 16 songs on this album, 15 of them newly written by Seeger and his longtime friend and collaborator Lorre Wyatt.

This may be the first album that Seeger's ever recorded that contains all new, all original material, and many of the tunes here are as good as anything Seeger or Wyatt has ever written or recorded. Most of the songs deal with aging and mortality, but the album is uplifting nonetheless. (allmusic.com)
