Tooth & Nail is an album on which Billy does what he does best - creating a tension between the struggle to change the world and the struggle to maintain relationships with those who we love the most. Returning to the rootsy sound of the Mermaid Avenue sessions and recorded in just five days in the basement of legendary producer Joe Henry's house in South Pasadena, Billy's voice has never sounded better. The overall effect is an album that Mojo magazine described as, ΓÇªhis best yet. (billybragg.co.uk)
