One of the most anticipated tracks from Above & Beyond's DJ sets over recent months, "When You Loved Me" sees two of Anjunabeats' most celebrated producers team up in Norwegian legend Boom Jinx and Israel's finest Maor Levi, joined by American vocalist Ashley Tomberlin.

A favourite from "Anjunabeats Volume 10" and a brooding summer anthem, "When You Loved Me" is a roller coaster club track that is full of contrast, feeling and power.

Driven by raw emotion and sweeping melodies, "When You Loved Me" makes dramatic use of Tomberlin's searching tones and builds to a violent, bass fuelled drop; retaliation at a relationship now lost.
