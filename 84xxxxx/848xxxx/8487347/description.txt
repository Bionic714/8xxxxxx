
Pixo has been abducted by dirty aliens! Can you help him tidy up their ship?

In this retro-styled sokoban game your task is to help Pixo tidy up the alien ship by placing all the crates of rubbish on the airlocks so the aliens can blow them out into space. But the crates are too heavy to pull and can only be pushed through the ships corridors, so take care not to box yourself in!

The game features 126 levels of enchanting pixel art and mind bending puzzles, as well as an easy going sound-track and fun sounds. Oh, and do well and the aliens will reward Pixo with a new hat from their collections! Complete all 126 levels and they'll give you the famed "Pixoban Crown"...
