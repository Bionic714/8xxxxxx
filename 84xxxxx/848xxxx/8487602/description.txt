You are Matthew Kane, an elite member of Rhino Squad and Earth's valiant invasion force. Fight alone, with your squad, and in hover tanks and mechanized walkers as you engage in a heroic mission into the heart of the Strogg war machine. But, in this epic war between worlds, the only way to defeat the Strogg is to become one of them. Battle through early missions as a deadly marine, then after your capture as a marine-turned-Strogg with enhanced abilities and the power to turn the tide of the war.  

This is a First Person Shooter, well loved by most who played it. Gamespot rated it as 8 out of 10 (Great), IGN rated it as 8.1 (Great), I give it a solid 8 also.

This game doesn't have controller support, but I have added Xpadder with pre-mapped configs for the Xbox360, & generic PS3PC controller, you can create a profile for almost any controller very easily with Xpadder (2012 version).
