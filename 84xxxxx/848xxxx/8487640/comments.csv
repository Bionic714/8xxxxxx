Can't wait for the new album. "

,notfragile,2013-05-19T07:28Z,"***THiS CD iS A BOOTLEG: Sound Quality C++ to B- ***

I think you are being too modest with the rating - This is clearer than being there - Ozzy's vocals are cleaner and easily understood.
Easily B+ to A-"

PS. for anyone looking for a great video bootleg from this tour, check out the youtube posts by 'sssikuk' he has a complete show with perfect sound and perfectly filmed, almost pro quality in full 1080p HD "
