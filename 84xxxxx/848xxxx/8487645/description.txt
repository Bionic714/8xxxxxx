Drills! Drills! Drills! A complete workout with finger cymbals for belly dancers of all levels with Michelle Joyce

This DVD is designed to help you learn to make the most of your practice time. This is not simply a workout DVD, but also a lesson in how to practice. The elements of an effective practice routine are broken down and explained as you are guided through a complete, fully body dance workout.
There are several drills at varying levels of difficulty that are designed to increase your physical strength, muscle memory, and coordination. The beginner dancer can benefit from the breakdown of the moves and the slow isolation drills, while the more advanced dancer can go straight to the chapters that incorporate finger cymbals and layering techniques.
Over time you will notice the moves becoming firmly ingrained in your muscle memory. With regular practice, you will develop a strong, trained body that can effortlessly layer shimmies with isolations and finger cymbals.
The workout includes:
-Strengthening Drills
-Isolation Drills
