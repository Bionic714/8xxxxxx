This set of classic Dave Brubeck is a must get if you are a fan of the cool jazz period of 1958 to the mid 1960s. Albums such as Time Out are featured on these CDs largely including many great Live songs and the all time classic Unsquare Dance, must be one of the catchiest songs ever produced. There are also some beautiful romantic jazz ballads such as Georgia On My Mind and Blue Shadows In The Night. (amazon.com)
