redump.org's goal is to have a complete database of disc-based media using only
original media. They provide the necessary tools and info to users so that
discs can be preserved by using high standard/strict dumping methods. They are
similar to groups like GoodTools, No-Intro, TOSEC.

They currently have more than 14900 (~4700 PSX) disc entries present in their
database.

They can be found:  
http://redump.org/

By dumping missing discs on the redump.org database, you would be helping to
achieve greater common goal and indirectly helping us to have a more complete,
verified collection. If you have original black CDs not listed in the PSX
database or even listed ones, please go that extra mile and learn about their
dumping methods.

Their guides on how to dump discs properly can be found here:
