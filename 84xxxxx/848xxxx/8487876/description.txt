Harishkumar S. Patel (Sunil Malhotra) is a geeky 
student from a small village in Gujarat, India   
who is attending the University of Houston, while
living with his uncle (his father's best friend).
His uncle, Dr. Bakshi, has an American-born son  
who's Hari's age, Mohan Bakshi (Kal Penn).       
Mohan, known as Mo, is a popular student at UH.  
He shows Hari around the college but then        
stays away from him because of Hari's nerdy ways.
This film is primarily a comedic portrayal of    
young Indian Americans going through life.
