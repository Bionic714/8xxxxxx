Banana Raincoat is an alternative indie rock/pop/metal band from Uherské Hradiště, Czech Rep., formed a few years ago. They started as a group of friends playing just to kill time and since then they managed to become one of the best bands in the region. Here are all their records I could find (including the only one "official", which technically makes it a discography), all in both MP3 and FLAC (that's why it's so big. sorry...)
