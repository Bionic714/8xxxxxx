Hello!
Behold, my very first torrent.
I should probably start with credits.
All of the episode are from eztv.it, mostly from the release group "LOL", but with some from "2HD" as well.
The web seeds are from ADrive (obviously).
Most of the subtitles are from uksubtitles.ru, and renamed by me, so they work with the episode.
Hopefully they're all in sync ^.^
Please seed this torrent for as long as you can, or till a ratio of 2.000 (or higher, the more the merrier :D),
The web seed will expire soon.
All credits go to the BBC, and if you love the show, support the people who make it: BUY IT!
If you need anything, or if there's anything I messed up, or requests, leave it in the comments :)
Enjoy my first torrent,
theviki

If the web seeds don't work, here is a list of them, and if they still don't work, use this as a direct download, move it to the downloaded folder and KEEP SEEDING PLEASE! (I don't have a seedbox!)
