Doctor Who Series 7

The seventh series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who was the show's third series in which Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill played the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor and his companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams respectively. The latter two characters feature during the series' first five episodes. However, they depart in the fifth episode, after which both Gillan and Darvill left the show and were replaced by Jenna-Louise Coleman, portraying Clara Oswald. The 2012 Christmas Special introduces a new TARDIS interior, title sequence, theme tune, and costume for the Doctor. Clara Oswald joins him for the second half of the series.
