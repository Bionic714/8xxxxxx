This torrent collects (to my knowledge) the rest of the E-Man series/appearances that I did not have at the time I uploaded E-Man's First Comics series (still available here: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8445159/E-Man_(First_Comics)).

To recap:

E-Man is a fictional comic book superhero created by writer Nicola Cuti and artist Joe Staton for Charlton Comics in 1973. Though the character's original series was short-lived, the lightly humorous hero has become a cult-classic sporadically revived by various independent comics publishers.

Thanks big-time to BK, who came through for me once again by providing these!

Props to the creative teams and the scanners. Keep it alive, people!
