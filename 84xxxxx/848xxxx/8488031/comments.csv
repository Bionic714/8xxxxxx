,Monstar79,2013-05-19T23:39Z,I've made 3 coasters trying to burn this game... I have made hundreds of games and this is the only one that has given me any problems.
,Assassinprofessor,2013-05-20T00:01Z,"#Monstar79 
ke on trying bro, the game works perfectly :)

,bruno5379,2013-05-20T00:32Z,"''Access denied'' whenever trying to insert L3.0 to L2.0 topology , great just great"
,jakenator,2013-05-20T05:08Z,@Monstar79: On almost every 360 game torrent there is always one person who says they never had problems with a game till now. My suggestion is to invest some money and get a RGH. It only cost me $65 and now I never have to burn another game.
,samengo,2013-05-20T16:02Z,Speed is awesome-game not tested yet
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-05-20T19:49Z,"@_whoa_: This is real iMARS release, but already unpacked for you. If you want with rar files, look on private trackers. "
,samengo,2013-05-20T20:18Z,Don´t work
,yllibi,2013-05-20T20:43Z,"For those still on LT 2.0 - dashboard 15574 or above    
(using imgburn 2.5.7.0 version as default iso/image burner)

The method below has worked on all xgd3 games so far.

1) inject topology 2.0 with xbox backup creator
2) use the dvd file that comes witht the iso, this opens imgburn 
3) go to tools/seetings/write/user specified/ and set layerbreak on 2086912
4) click burn image, a message pops-up and you must select truncate method
5) another message says (do you want to use calculate optimal) you must to click NO
6) the final message says do you want ""to continue anyaway"" you click YES

then wait for the burn and try the game.

P.S. I haven't downloaded the game yet, but I'm pretty sure it will work. "
,samengo,2013-05-20T21:06Z,"Sorry,my fault-it works 100% !"
,vinnievic86,2013-05-21T07:20Z,Works great thanks for the up.. game is lame though.

,aisac007,2013-05-24T21:08Z,everything works on RGH including this torrent
,yllibi,2013-05-24T22:41Z,"the game works on lt 2.0,
