Ballistic Kisses ?ΓÇô Total Access (1982)

The first of two albums from this NY-based band.

From eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com: "Keyboard-driven with no guitar, BK songs were stripped down and rhythmic; lyrically, they were more complex. They took an unblinking look at the harsh realities of life on the Lower East Side where, for many, it was not Morning in America. 'Domestic Servants' examined the hard times of the working poor; 'Black and Broke' defiantly celebrated sex workers struggling for some dignity; and the song in todayΓÇÖs clip, 'Tuff Shit', brutally skewered the haves take on the have-nots. Jeff Freund says, 'It was a fantasy came true for me ΓÇö to take MichaelΓÇÖs poetry and turn it into credible music. It was real street, he was the articulate punk.'

The Ballistic Kisses recorded two albums in the UK, 'Total Access' and 'Wet Moment'. David Wojnarowicz, artist and friend of the band, designed the covers. 'The songs were so simple they appealed to peopleΓÇÖs basic instincts,' McClusky said. 'You got fired from your job, well thatΓÇÖs Tuff Shit. I was very happy that I was able to play music, with words that really meant something to me, that told stories. That was the greatest part, the camaraderie and the message.'ΓÇ¥
