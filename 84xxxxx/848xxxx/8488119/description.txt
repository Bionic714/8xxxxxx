This trainer will remain undetected when you use it online. It has the ability to crash any player on the server with the click of a button, as well as fun features such as spawning vehicles or teleporting. The demise of GTA 4 multiplayer online is here.

You also need Visual Studio 2010 along with the DirectX SDK June 2010 in order for XL Trainer to work. 
If using Simple Native Trainer, use F3 to activate the menu then F4 to toggle it on/off the rest of the match. 

Here's an anti-tuga mod, it will prevent tuga's from crashing you: http://eng.warcmaps.com/gta4/other/Dont_Get_Tug-ED
(use a program such as OpenIV or SparkIV to replace the tuga texture)
