Plague Town: An Ashley Parker Novel 
Dana Fredsti (Author)


In the small university town of Redwood Grove, people are succumbing to a lethal strain of flu. They are dying -- but not for long.

Ashley Parker and her boyfriend are attacked by these shambling, rotting creatures that crave human flesh. Their lives will never be the same again.

When she awakes Ashley discovers that she is a "wild card" -- immune to the virus -- and is recruited by a shadowy paramilitary organization that offers her the chance to fight back. Fatally attracted to her gorgeous instructor, and bonding with her fellow wild cards, Ashley begins to discover skills she never knew she had.

As the town falls to ever-growing numbers of the infected, Ashley and her team fight to contain the outbreak -- but will they be enough?
