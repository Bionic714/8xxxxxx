If you could do eps. S02E16-19 as well that would be great!"
,a-naughty-mouse,2013-05-19T10:00Z,"S02E16 thru E19 are already on TPB (and quality looks as good based on a quick scan):

,a-naughty-mouse,2013-05-19T10:01Z,"mistergog: any idea what ""gog"" means? My kid has an imaginary friend named Gog (and you seem like the man to ask =)"
,mistergog,2013-05-19T11:16Z,"Ahh. OK. I used trust and bitch as search parameters. Worked for the first four but not for the last. Duh doy!
Where Gog comes from... well, when I picked it I remember I had a thought behind it but what that was.... not a man among us can remember.
Sorry."
,dhavhid,2013-05-19T14:05Z,"when you download episodes 13, 14 and 15 , it changes the name of the episodes to 6, 7 and 9

why? are these ones FAKE????"
,mistergog,2013-05-19T22:53Z,"dhavihid: definately not fake. He just renamed them after the correct viewing order instead of the incorrect airing order.
Read the description."
,dhavhid,2013-05-20T14:18Z,ok thx for the answer :)
,iryhousen,2013-05-23T02:39Z,Very confusing numbering.  It might be better to use the episode titles.
,aiigghht,2013-05-29T12:41Z,The episode order posted is still not correct
,aiigghht,2013-05-29T15:54Z,"I can't find the correct order listed anywhere online.

That order is not quite right though, after the hamptons ep when June announces her new job shes back working at the coffee shop again instead of the new job.

In the same episode Mark breaks up with his g/f but afterwards they're together still., in the next few episodes the Halloween and thanksgiving episodes are in the wrong order too."
