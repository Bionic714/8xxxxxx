A 3 part adaptation of this Agatha Christie story.

Luke Fitzwilliam has recently returned to England after serving abroad in the colonial police. On a train he meets a woman who tells him that she is going to Scotland Yard to report a series of murders in her village which have been regarded as accidents. Outside Scotland Yard though, she is run over and killed. Luke decides to investigate her story.......

The usual cast of middle class suspects, red herrings and loose ends left untied, but the director gives the story a more modern feel.
