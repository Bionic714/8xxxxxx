Writer Steve Boggan decides to follow the course of a ten dollar bill across America over the course of 30 days. He promises not to interfere or influence how the money is spent, though confesses that he would have intervened if the bill had been deposited at a bank or spent at a supermarket. The note is colour coded so that he can recognise it easily, though given that in these extracts, the holders of the bill appear extraordinarily compliant in allowing him to follow them and even ΓÇô as only seems to happen in travelogues of this sort rather than to any of us ΓÇô taking him into their homes as well as their confidence.

The journey starts in the small town (in Britain it would be classed as little more than a hamlet) of Lebanon, Kansas which geographers in the early 20th century defined as the settlement closet to the geographical heart of the USA and takes him via Arkansas and Mississipi (or it could be Missouri ΓÇô I was listening to that bit in the middle of the night!) and ends up on a deer hunt in Michigan.

Whimsical, but passes an hour or so. Episode 3 was unfortunately cut short on the BBCiPlayer, and is thus missing about the last 3 minutes, but does not spoil the overall narrative.
