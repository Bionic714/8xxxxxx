This is a full cast drama from 1961. The sound quality is not that great, but quite listenable.

Set many years in the future, a starship is on the return journey to Earth when it is hit by two meteorites. The ship must land somewhere to make repairs, but the nearest suitable planet is a ΓÇ£closed planetΓÇ¥ on which outsiders are not permitted to land. Forced by their situation to make a landing, they find that the inhabitants are humanoid and speak English (as well as their own language). Police, restaurants, bars and TV reporters are also to be found on this alien world! The multi-ethnic crew find however that the planet is racked by dissent, and finally discover why it is a ΓÇ£closed planetΓÇ¥.

Although written several years before Star Trek, there are several similarities between the two ΓÇô though no trail of willing alien women falling for the charms of a porky Captain Kirk! The parallels between the closed planet and the cold war Soviet Union are obvious, but it makes for interesting listening and the plot is superior to other British radio sci fi dramas of the period. ItΓÇÖs also of interest that the cast ΓÇô not listed here as I could not possibly spell some of the names! ΓÇô appears surprisingly multi-national for a period before Britain became a multi-ethnic society.
