,aiigghht,2013-05-29T12:41Z,Episode order is still incorrect.
,aiigghht,2013-05-29T15:54Z,"I can't find the correct order listed anywhere online.

That order is not quite right though, after the hamptons ep when June announces her new job shes back working at the coffee shop again instead of the new job.

In the same episode Mark breaks up with his g/f but afterwards they're together still., in the next few episodes the Halloween and thanksgiving episodes are in the wrong order too."
