,ChingaTuu,2013-05-19T05:48Z,...Mindreader! I was about to ask if you'd come across any Target scans. :)
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-19T05:51Z,"...Oh, and I'll be seeding these for at least a week once they've finished dl'ing on my end. I've got a whole mess of Mothra's sets that are seeding, and from the looks of things some of those may stay online for a few extra days. 

Again, all hail Mothra for his efforts! Good stuff, Maynard! :)"
,Mothra67,2013-05-19T06:40Z,"Thanks so much!  it took me 2 days to DL all of these!  but TPB is worth it!   I also gotta find some more obscurities thanks to Alex Ross, like Skyman, Mr. Face, Marvelo, the Sword, the boy King, radior, and several other little known Heroes!"
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-27T02:57Z,"...Kids, I've seen a bit heavier demand for this one than I expected, so I'll continue to seed it for a few more days just to help out. Again, excellent work, Mothra! 

""You're The Target?""

""That's pronounced 'Tar-JHAY', officer?""

""Huh?""

""Yes, I'm a high-class superhero!""

""Oh. And I guess your buddy Captain Wal-Mart is a low-class superhero, then?"""
