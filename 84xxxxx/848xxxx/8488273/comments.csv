,Theata,2013-05-19T15:02Z,That would be good for a couple of days if possible. PC will be on 24/7 until there are at least 3 REAL seeders (That will be presumed when my initial seed has passed 150%)
,Theata,2013-05-21T15:03Z,"Sorry, I should Clarify, the Christmas special was removed at short notice before uploading in an attempt to minimize torrent size. the Christmas special from 2012 is NOT included in this torrent, I completely forgot to remove the reference to it before I posted it and I feel it is not something that deemed the whole torrent to be removed and re-added as there is a file list to confirm what is in the torrent."

,axelrhal,2013-06-04T09:30Z,how safe is it to seed for long periods?
,Theata,2013-06-07T10:36Z,"it depends on your Country, in America I wouldn't recommend seeding for over 1 week unless you are using a proxy. I have had reports that in New Zealand however people have been able to get 1.5+ TB down and 2-3TB up with no infringement notices sent over 2-3 years. so its really country dependent. "

,crixeh,2013-06-12T11:08Z,"Is it just me or are the subs missing, while it says in both the torrent info and in the description that there are english subs present?

Since there are no external sub files, I assumed they were imbedded in the .mkv container, but there are none to be displayed during playback..."
,Theata,2013-06-13T17:19Z,"It would seem that for some reason the original encoders of the files added a ""Sub"" set containing Nothing. I neglected to actually check the subs as I didn't use them. So if you would like the subs for the episodes you may have to look up .srt files for them, a quick google search should do the trick, Sorry for the inconvenience."
