The multiple-award winning iFly 737NG widely-regarded as quite simply the finest 737NG simulation ever to grace a home computer and rated by both 737 enthusiasts and many actual pilots as the de-facto `airliner sim`. Until now getting a home built cockpit for your 737NG set-up ΓÇô be it just a few basic displays in a study or a full professional build ΓÇô has been both tricky and extremely expensive.
Now cockpit building enthusiasts have the ultimate ΓÇÿout of the boxΓÇÖ solution from Flight1 with the iFly 737NG Pro ΓÇô Cockpit Builders Edition  for your displays and gauges.

You can now easily setup gauges across multiple screens and networked computers without having to run undocked windows just on a single PC. This massively improves performance over and gives many additional benefits for the home cockpit builder.

The cockpit builders software seamlessly integrates with the iFly 737NG for FSX, giving users the ultimate in flexibility in their choice of 737NG model and allows fitting out their cockpit with their choice of airline customer options.
Using its own protocol, the client PCs connect with FSX and the iFly 737NG via the installed server program, allowing the user to create, resize and position all of the gauges required for the perfect 737NG flight deck. Create custom combinations of displays that automatically open on each client screen, perfectly sized, positioned and saved.

This boxed-only ΓÇÿProΓÇÖ edition designed especially for home cockpit builders and those using 737 cockpits with FSX for personal use, contains a comprehensive printed Gauge Configuration manual which explains the essentials to get you started in using the Pro Cockpit Builders software.
A second printed manual gets you flying the iFly737NG, which also features a first flight tutorial PLUS full-colour poster-sized panel guide indexed to both the printed and PDF tutorials to help you find your way around the flight deck.

A 500 page Operations Manual based on the real aircraft manual, Quick Reference Handbook, and an extensive tutorial giving advanced training in the use of the FMC and autoflight system are automatically installed in PDF format!

If you already own a licensed version of the iFly 737NG for FSX (either boxed or download) then you can purchase the Upgrade Edition of this title with all the printed materials, but without the iFly 737NG for FSX aircraft for a discounted price

This extensive package has stunning exterior models of every NG and BBJ variant. Each can be flown with an incredibly realistic virtual cockpit in addition to the `Cockpit Builders` configuration and with a level of systems simulation authenticated by real NG Pilots. Systems and flight dynamics have been tested by real 737NG pilots to ensure that accuracy of performance and functions mirrors the real aircraft.
