Introduction by Jimmy Stewart for about 15 min then interviews with the ol' timers
that played the game in the 1800's. 

Curt Gowdy takes it the rest of the way with actual play by play radio broadcasts
from whenever radio started broadcasting baseball to 1968 when the Tigers won the 
World Series...and this record was recorded...

I don't know if anyone even has this album...it's that RARE...

but here it is in great quality...If you are a baseball fan you will enjoy, just
for example "the shot heard 'round the world" and Denny Mclain's 30 wins, the last
time any pitcher has ever done that...Roger Maris' 61st homerun...Babe Ruth's
retirement speech...along with Lou Gehrig's - "today I consider myself the luckiest
man on the face of the earth...

Plus so much more...Definitively worth getting
