
Draw Slasher is a survival action game in which you take control of a cute (but bad-ass) ninja whose peaceful island has been invaded by...well, Pirate Monkey Zombies!

Slash through your enemies like a dark shadow and become the archetypal warrior seen in countless Japanese anime! Use your katana to surgically dissect your opponents, or vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear behind them to become the very definition of the word "backstabber".

It doesn't matter what manner of death you prefer -- no invader can survive the wrath of the Dark Ninja!
