This game is a very cool PSP game, and because i could not find it anywhere I borrowed it created a ISO file and voula.

1. extract the game using winrar
2. Extracted file put in MsPro (C:)---&gt;ISO (if you don't have an ISO folder create it in ROOT)---&gt;And copy the file

This game works on custom firmware
