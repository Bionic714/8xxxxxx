,Mothra67,2013-05-19T05:12Z,Thank you so much for posting this brings back fond memories.....I was all OMFG when both the Flash and Dove bought it in this
,bgg1175,2013-05-19T05:23Z,"This series was from an era unlike today when creators tried for perfection and comics usually were a good fun read. 
Would be great to see an animated feature of this comic but they couldnt do it justice. 
This was George Perez at his best. "
,NEL117,2013-05-19T05:37Z,maraming salamat! thank you very much!
,BruceWayneJr,2013-05-19T06:15Z,The original is still the best.
,binderguy1,2013-05-19T06:15Z,"And then, 20 years later, DC went and dipped into the same well with INFINITE CRISIS and finally, 2 years later; FINAL CRISIS.

All or most of the continuity PRE-CRISIS gets brought back into current continuity (before the great reboot - The New 52 or The ENNUI 52)!!!

Oh, the headaches!  ;-)

Thanks for the ul, blackcanary, it's still a proven solid classic that withstands the times."

,tdurden83,2013-05-20T01:25Z,"thanks for uploading these. if this is supposed to be on of the greatest crossovers ever, how come there aren't at least 143 tie-in books to go with it? "
,tdurden83,2013-05-21T21:07Z,"i'm sure no one cares, but when I wrote that last comment, I didn't know there actually were a bunch of tie-ins. oh well, the way they do so many crossovers now is still ridiculous "
