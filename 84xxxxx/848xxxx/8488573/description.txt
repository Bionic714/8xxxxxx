The International Company known as Vescell specializes in what is commonly known as 'Vtrans', the transferring of a person's mind and spirit from one body into another. Former Icarus City Detective, Mauricio 'Moo' Barrino is now Vescell's best agent, handling the most high profile and dangerous cases. In the seedy world of a high end corporate espionage, where mysticism and guns clash, and money is tainted with sin, Agent Mauricio Barrino fights against the demons of fate while trying to reach the heaven of his destiny. Be prepared for the bar-raising, sci-fi noir epic that is VESCELL.
