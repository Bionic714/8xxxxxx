Either seed long enough for at least *five* extra seeders to be created, or don't waste our time, dammit.

Sheesh."
,Komlokk,2013-05-21T02:31Z,I'm seeding as much as my connection allows me
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-21T08:51Z,...Which at this point is AbZero. What are you using for an internet connection? Two tin cans and some string?
,lnce03,2013-05-21T10:03Z,@ChingaTuu LMAO that was funny
,neil_diamond ,2013-05-21T19:46Z,"OK I'm going to cut you some slack because you're new. When you upload at this slow a rate on something that's 3GB, you don't turn around and upload another 2GB comic set, BEFORE you've seeded out this one!

The point is sharing something WELL, not how many uploads can I create this week.
