Lecter's patient Franklin Froideveaux (Dan Fogler) worries that his friend Tobias may be a psychopath, but Franklin's growing obsession with Lecter is what concerns the latter more. Graham investigates the murder of a Baltimore musician who had his throat opened and a cello neck inserted through his mouth. Graham, with Lecter's guidance, interprets this as one killer serenading another. Graham's mental stability deteriorates further when he begins having auditory hallucinations of animals in pain and when his romantic feelings for Alana Bloom are rejected. When Franklin confesses to Lecter that Tobias had told him he wanted to cut open someone's throat and "play them like a violin," Lecter confronts Tobias, who reveals that not only is he the murderer, but he knows that Lecter is one as well and feels that they could be friends. Lecter passes on some of this information to Graham, once again putting an unknowing Graham in a dangerous situation when he goes to question him. Tobias kills two police officers who accompanied Graham and escapes to Lecter's office, where Franklin is having a session. Lecter kills both Franklin and Tobias and lies to Crawford about what happened. Lecter confides to his own psychoanalyst, Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson), that he believes he might have found a true friend in Graham.
