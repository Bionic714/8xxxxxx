The good news is it is the whole song, and its the only one up so far so it'll have to do.

The bad news is its clearly a bootleg, most likely from a Youtube video and the song is not very clear and you can hear people talking in the background.

The uploader has put this up as to give off its an official release of the song when it is nothing more than a Youtube or bootleg rip."
