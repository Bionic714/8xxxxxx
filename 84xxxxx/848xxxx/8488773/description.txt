...
Mikoto unleashes her anger at Accelerator, who quickly deduces she is the original, becoming further enraged upon seeing Misaka 9982's torn leg and hearing Accelerator's selfish reasons for participating in the experiment. However, even her most powerful attacks are simply reflected back at her. Just then, the fight is halted by the arrival of dozens of other Sisters, who request that Accelerator stop fighting Mikoto to avoid throwing off the experiment's calculations. As Accelerator takes his leave, Mikoto feels no comfort in hearing the Sisters acknowledge themselves as nothing more than guinea pigs. After a restless night, Mikoto is approached by Shinobu, who explains why she chose to oppose the experiment. Having been called back from the Radio Noise Project to assist in the Level 6 Shift Project, Shinobu got to see the sensitive side of one of the Sisters and become unable to see them as anything other than human. Upon hearing this, Mikoto takes it upon herself to destroy the facilities involved in the experiment, keeping it a secret from Kuroko and the others.
