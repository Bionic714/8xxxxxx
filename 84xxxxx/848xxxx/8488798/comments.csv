,bmnott,2013-05-19T11:15Z,"this is waaay scarier than paranormal witness.

the cabin story is actually almost the same entity as the poltergeist story in paranormal witness.

i wish there were some way to bring the 2 together."
,bmnott,2013-05-19T11:29Z,"I wonder how Claire and her friend could give this story without HIPAA privacy concerns. Would the son be happy to hear his mother ""confess"" she was guilty?

I wonder if these stories, or this one, is ""fake"""
