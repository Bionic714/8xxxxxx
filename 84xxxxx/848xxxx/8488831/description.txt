Jessica Williams - 1992 - At Maybeck

One of the happiest events of the 1990s has been the emergence of Jessica Williams as one of the most talented pianists in jazz. Her Maybeck Recital Hall solo concert is as good a place as any to discover her abilities. She explores a variety of standards and four of her originals (along with Dave Brubeck's fairly obscure "Summer Song") with creativity and wit. Sometimes Williams shows off the influence of Thelonious Monk but she rarely stays predictable for long and her sense of humor is quite original. This is an impressive outing with her interpretations of "Why Do I Love You?," "I'm Confessin" and "It's Easy to Remember" being among the highlights. (AllMusic)
