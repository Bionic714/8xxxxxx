From time to time, we've all experienced coincidences that seem to be endowed with a special meaning or significance, and that appear to defy the laws of probability. For the most part, these coincidences seem amusing or insignificant. But a famous psychologist defined these moments of meaningful coincidence as "Synchronicity." A synchronicity is a coming together of seemingly unrelated events. Celebrated pioneer of alternative health, Dr. Deepak Chopra has created a mind-opening program that will change the way you perceive the world forever, SynchroDestiny: Discover the Power of Meaningful Coincidence to Manifest Abundance in Your Life. Once you master the principles of SynchroDestiny, you'll be able to use your newfound power to manifest abundance in every area of your life. Much like a powerful magnet, you will begin to attract material wealth, emotional well-being, spiritual fulfillment, and a deep awareness of your life's true meaning and purpose.

customer review: "This is by far the best Deepak Chopra has ever put out. This is a life altering series that changes your perceptions about the seemingly simple coincidences one finds in their daily life to the much more profound understanding of learning how to recognize the universes support and wielding it into the manifestation of our desires. This is extremely practical and simple to go through. I highly recommend it as one of the very best audio books available today. I wish to God I had seen this product 20 years ago. Chopra is amazing, he makes his argument simple, he is such an educated man. The material that he discusses are complex but he does an amazing job of breaking it down to make it simple to grasp and put to work immediately. I recommend this 100%, if you can buy it, get it now."
