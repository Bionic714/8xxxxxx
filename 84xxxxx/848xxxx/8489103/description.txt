Humans! Tonight's The Nerdist show on BBC America is so jam packed full of amazing
things that it's leaking out of the sides and making a mess all over the floor! Get
out the Sham-Wow and the wet-vac because we're about to get beautiful all over your
television set. That's right - two of the best looking people on the planet join
Chris Hardwick tonight. We'll start with Joe Manganiello, who stars as the six foot
five werewolf on True Blood (and yes, we've determined that he actually is that tall
- but can he get through our revolving door?) Plus, the lovely Morena Baccarin from
Firefly and Homeland joins us. We'll enlist both of them to help us play a game
called "Obscure Comic Book Character, German Restaurant, or Dinosaur?" Matt and
Jonah head off once more as our Nerdist ambassadors to the United Kingdom and well-
dressed comedian Paul F. Tompkins spins some yarns. All this on The Nerdist tonight!
