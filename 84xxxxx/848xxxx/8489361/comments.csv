Will seed!!!"
[V],psspss,2013-05-20T06:01Z,"I had to drop off when hit 2gb shared

hope people seed now. I see 30 had it and 30 more want it

I taking that docu on Baltic Sea is another way they going to make money from it.. 

if its nto ufo but some made man structure its be still a very cool docu if they filming the men diving.. unless the Promo is BS one???

I thought the 2011 congress one on S4 in Area 51 was interesting

I still find it hard to believe in time travelling and ets from our future.. seems non sense to me

I dont think time travel would ever be able to be done.. unless its a really quirky interdimensional thing

as I dont believe einsteins space=time theory is corrupt.. even so if can bend space and get to a location sooner dont mean you can get before things happened.. as time is always ticking and looking at star light is billions years old.. and look back in time is BS cos it happened billions years ago but we just see it now.. you can go back to the point light left.. if know what i mean.. so wonder how much BS is in this UFO docus and liers"
[V],psspss,2013-05-20T06:02Z,opps space=time theory is correct i mean
