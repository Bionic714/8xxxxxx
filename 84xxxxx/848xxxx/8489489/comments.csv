Manually set it to 1MB / 1024kB.
It will hugely help you seed the torrent faster."

,Gounis,2013-05-21T12:17Z,"You got me wrong, I'm not saying your upload speed will increase.
All I'm saying is that smaller piece size combined with initial seeding will require less data for you to seed before completion.
Your share ratio will drop dramatically.
Google around for more info, try it on your next torrent and see for yourself.
You have nothing to loose.
Keep up the good work."
