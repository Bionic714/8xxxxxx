Thanks for these torrents! 

I noticed there is a .docx file with them. If you open the file and look at the properties it shows the names 0*** and M***** R O*** as creators and modifyers of the file.

Not sure if that's what you want. You might want to use .txt instead of a proprietary M$ format or use an unregistered copy and notepad or another simple text editor.
