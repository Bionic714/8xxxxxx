Larry makes his way across Iowa to become a carny at one of America's oldest state fairs.
Larry's trip starts with a chance meeting with an alligator wrestler, which leads to Larry
and crew watching over a baby gator on their way to Des Moines. 
The journey also includes a jittery Larry among thousands of swarming bees as he learns
the tricks of the trade at a honey farm as well as a stop at the Iowa house that inspired
the iconic painting "American Gothic"

Enjoy!
