A never-before-heard firsthand account of a government insiderΓÇÖs experience on the cutting edge of UFO exploration
While still on active duty in the U.S. Army during the 1980s, Colonel John B. Alexander, Ph.D., created an interagency group to explore the controversial topic of UFOs. Participants came from the Army, Navy, Air Force, CIA, NSA, DIA, and the aerospace industry. All members held Top Secret clearance. What they discovered was not at all what was expected. UFOs covers the numerous cases they saw, and answers questions like:
ΓÇó What was really in Hanger 18?
ΓÇó Did a UFO land at Holloman Air Force Base?
ΓÇó What happened at Roswell?
ΓÇó What is Majestic 12?
ΓÇó What is the Aviary?
ΓÇó What does the government know about UFOs?
ΓÇó What has happened with disclosure in other countries?
ΓÇó Has the U.S. reverse engineered a UFO?
ΓÇó Why donΓÇÖt presidents get access to UFO info?
UFOs is at once a complete account of AlexanderΓÇÖs findings, and a call to action. There are no conspiracy theories hereΓÇöonly hard factsΓÇöbut they are merely the beginning. Serious research is needed in order to understand and anticipate the workings of UFOs, and John Alexander is leading the charge.
