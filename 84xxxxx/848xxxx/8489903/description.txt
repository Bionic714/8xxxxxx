Does not contain :
WindowsXP-KB892130-ENU-x86.exe 	  	KB892130 	Windows Genuine Advantage Validation v1.9.42.0
WindowsXP-KB905474-ENU-x86.exe 	  	KB905474 	Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications v1.9.40.0

Since most people do not want to have WGA installed.

IE6 is dead. No more updates for IE6
And will therefore almost just run with IE8 and their updates unless someone wants IE6
I can make a verison with the latest and updates that did.
(Over Gone to IE8)
