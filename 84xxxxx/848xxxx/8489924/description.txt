AMAZING

Scary, wicked fast compared to Transmit 3 ΓÇö up to 25 times.

4x faster: listing 30,000 remote files.
18x faster: downloading 30,000 small files.
2.25x faster: deleting 30,000 small files.
25x faster: uploading 15,000 small files.

AND ONE MORE THING: TRANSMIT DISK.

With the brand-new Transmit Disk feature, you can now mount any of your favorites in the Finder itself ΓÇö even if Transmit's not running. These volumes are real: drag files to your SFTP server, save a small graphic to your Amazon S3 bucket directly from Photoshop, or roll your own iDisk-like backup volume. It's all possible in T4.

THIS IS THE BEST FILE TRANSFER CLIENT YOU'LL EVER BUY. Really!
