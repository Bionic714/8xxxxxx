The Grover Gardner narrations are of higher quality than the 128k CD versions.  The Shelby Foote chapters were captured through a USB connected tape player, however my source tapes had had many plays throughout the years and are not perfect.  

Regardless, Shelby Footes own narration is truly to best possible way to experience this book."

This is a great history! The sound is bit tilted toward the high freq end but big deal. BTW - the directory and file structure and naming makes it easy to go to know where everything is located - like if you wanted to listen to stuff about the battle of Gettysburg, for example.

All in all, this is a GREAT torrent! "
