SPEEDFAN 4.47

SpeedFan is a program that monitors voltages, fan speeds and temperatures in computers with hardware monitor chips. SpeedFan can even access S.M.A.R.T. info and show hard disk temperatures. SpeedFan supports SCSI disks too. SpeedFan can even change the FSB on some hardware (but this should be considered a bonus feature). SpeedFan can access digital temperature sensors and can change fan speeds accordingly, thus reducing noise. SpeedFan works fine with Windows 9x, ME, NT, 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. It works with Windows 64 bit too.  SpeedFan can access the temperature sensors available on your motherboard and on your nVidia video card. The most widely available temperatures are from the chipset, the CPU, the ambient and from the power circuitry.  Modern CPUs can report their own internal temperature. Multi-core CPUs are often able to report temperatures from each single core. SpeedFan can access those readings and report changes.  More powerful hardware (motherboards, CPUs, video cards and hard disks) often requires more power. More power leads to more heat to dissipate. A proper airflow inside the computer cabinet helps to keep temperatures low. Inside computers there are fans that create such an airflow. SpeedFan can report the speeds of each fan and it can even change their speed based on current temperatures. This lowers noise and improves computer experience.  SpeedFan can access the voltages reported by the hardware. This can help to identify odd issues with computers resetting under stress, for example. Please, note that SpeedFan reports the voltages according to the official documentation. Sometimes hardware manufacturers use custom circuitry. In the FAQ you can find further info on this topic.  Almost every hard disk can report a set of data about its own health and status. This is called S.M.A.R.T.. Based on reported data, a hard disk failure can often be early detected. Hard disk temperature can be read too and it is useful to identify overheating components that could reduce your valuable data reliability. SpeedFan offers a unique feature (called "In-depth online analysis") that compares your hard disk SMART data to a model derived from millions of reports. This helps to better identify when a specific hard disk is outside "normal" values.  SpeedFan can report health data and statistical values returned by SCSI hard disks. Such data contains the hard disk temperature too. Hard disk temperatures are positively correlated to hard disk failures. This is the reason why these information are so important.  SMART data from hard disks connected to RAID (software or hardware) controllers is more difficult to be read. SpeedFan is improving RAID support and it currently properly supports software RAID (offered by Windows) and ARECA controllers.
