#2 most of the books he appeared in that I have found have been severely damaged or incomplete to the point of unreadability!  here's the best that are complete!

Now, on to THE FACE:

ony Trent, a newscaster for the radio station WBSC, witnesses a murder committed by gangsters disguised as cops. Consequentally he decides to fight crime. Having no innate superpowers, he instead uses a mask to scare criminals. Trent would use his position to learn of crimes and catch those behind them as The Face!

Later circumstances caused Tony to give up his Face identity, but he still worked for the cause of justice.
