Supah Ninjas - Season 2 - Complete (WEB-DL - 1080p)
---------------------------------------------------

Mike Fukanaga is a normal high-school student with a best friend, Owen, and a
longtime crush, Amanda. But when his grandfather dies, Mike is given a letter
that turns his world upside down by revealing that he comes from a long line
of ninjas. With that news, Mike is ushered into the world of crime fighting -
along with Owen and Amanda, with whom he forms the Supah Ninja team. Mike's
grandfather, as a hologram who Owen calls Hologramps, trains the trio and
acts as the team's spiritual leader.
