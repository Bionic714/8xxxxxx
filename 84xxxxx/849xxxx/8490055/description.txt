Description

“I can’t recommend it enough.” — Ben Brooks
“Lives up to its hype.” — CultOfMac
“Incredibly Impressive.” — Beautiful Pixels

Ulysses III is a brand-new writers’ environment from the Soulmen — the fine folks that brought you Daedalus Touch for iPad.

It’s built around a revolutionary engine, dubbed “plain text enhanced”, which combines the very best parts of minimal markup (i.e. Markdown, Textile) with the power, beauty and simplicity of OS X.

As a single-library app, Ulysses holds all your texts in just one window. No “Open”, no “Save”, no Finder safari. Full iCloud integration lets you access *everything* from all your Macs.

If you own Daedalus Touch (available on the App Store as a universal app for iPad and iPhone), Ulysses III can even sync your writings across all your devices. Start on the bus, continue at home, finish mid-flight. Export to RTF, PDF, TXT or HTML.

Ulysses III is flexible, adaptive, and built to grow. Use it as a sophisticated notepad, create your next couple of novels, or continuously feed your blog. Keep everything neatly organized, or mess around at will.

- Spell check (i.e. without “check spelling as you type”)
- Versions UI (allows Copy)

Works better:
- Daedalus Integration
- External Sources (assume .txt files to be Markdown by default)
- Interoperability with other apps when using MultiMarkdown footnotes (that “newline thingy”, yay!)
- Escape sequences (Editor, External Sources)
- Insertion point & footnotes (no more jumping)
- Editor View (now updated with newly selected sheet when moving a sheet to Trash)
- Increase/Decrease Heading Levels (now separate menu commands)

Crashes crushed:
- Crash when using Sidebar with iCloud disabled (the Conspiracy crash)
- Crash with certain files in External Sources (the WhyDidntWeThinkOfThat crash)
- Crash when home folder was on second hard drive (the PowerUser crash)
- Crash when creating custom Markup (the WTH crash)
- Crash with Shift-Tab in an enumeration (the ZeroMinusOne crash)
- Crash when trying to modify sheets in Trash (the WhyWouldYou crash)
- Crash during state restoration (the Huh? crash)
- Crashes with sheets reappearing after being deleted (the SheetZ crash)
