"Like humans, dolphins have large brains and a complex social structure. In this Nova documentary, Private Lives of Dolphins, we see footage of behavior never witnessed before. While the privacy of dolphins at research stations in Florida and Australia may not be as secluded as in the open seas, we do get a glimpse of their behavior in the wild. In addition, the dolphin's relationship with humans is closely examined. This fascinating study of the dolphin's intelligence, and their interactions with both their own kind and with us, furnishes the viewer with a unique insight into the development of the mammalian brain."
Narrated by Stacy Keach.

Please seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others! My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.
