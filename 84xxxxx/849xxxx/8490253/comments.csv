,mhamer6,2013-05-23T00:08Z,How do I install the lp part?
[V],-wxm-,2013-05-23T16:47Z,"First load whatever version of iTunes you have 

Navigate to the itlp folder (make sure you don't rename any of the files in there) and drop the ""Random Access Memories - iTunes LP.itlp"" file into iTunes.

Once it's there it should show up as a playlist item, double click on it and it should show up as kind of interactive digital booklet thing."
