iFunbox: The Best File Manager For Your iPhone, iPad And iPod

The iPhone is a great device, no doubt about it: but it's got a closed file management system that ties you to iTunes - that is, until now.

Now you can use iFunBox, a powerful file manager for iPhone and iPod Touch that enables you to browse the contents of your Apple device as if it was just one more removable drive attached to the computer. What's more, it doesn't require any special hack.

All you have to do is plug your iPhone or iPod Touch to the PC and launch the program ΓÇô no installation required. iFunBox will immediately read the contents of the device and display it in a double-pane interface, with the folder structure on the left side and the date stored in the selected folder on the right side.

With iFunBox you can easily transfer files between the iPhone or iPod and the computer, take advantage of the device's storage and use it as a portable USB disk, and make backup copies of all your music and video files. iFunBox also lets you convert and upload any image to the iPhone as wallpaper, but unfortunately this function requires jailbreak.

iFunBox lets you make the most of your iPhone or iPod Touch by providing you with a full featured file browser that helps transfer data between your Apple device and your computer.
