Every fu*king single album, file etc has proper id3 tags. I grew angry at uploaders who upload music with messy tags and I have to correct them all myself.

London Symphony Orchestra - all under one name, divided into albums, and ofc if album has got 2/3 cds, it is divided into CD1/CD2. Every album has got properly set up year so no more idiotic things like "A new hope" - 1954-1997 (LOL - such tags exsist in online database!)
Believe me - you will like it :)
