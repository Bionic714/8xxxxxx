"80's Disc 1" contains 161 songs

 (disc 2 contains 150 songs for a total of 311 songs)

I have collected many 80's compilation CD's over the years. They have many great songs on them, but they also have many duplicates too. Some years ago I lined them all up in alphabetical order and removed the duplicates, based on quality and how complete the songs are. I kept them in their original folders and made two data CD's for use in my vehicle. So understand that when you notice that the CD's in each folder appear incomplete, as that IS intended to avoid duplicates. It still may not be the most complete set, but it is a great start. They are all tagged with info. MP3 Bit rate 128kbps
