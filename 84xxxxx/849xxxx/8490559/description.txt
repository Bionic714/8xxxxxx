First published in 1962, this book remains a uniquely readable introduction to the interests and outlooks of the great Western thinkers from Plato to Ockham. Its aim is to show the essential connection between the thought of the medieval schools of philosophy and that of the Greek philosophers, as it was mediated to the medieval world by the Neoplatonists, St Augustine, and the Arabian and Jewish thinkers of the early Middle Ages.
