
Synopsis in English:

This beautiful film essay explores three themes in Eustacheâ€™s work: cinema, absence, and mourning. Both inquiry and requiem, The Lost Sorrows of Jean Eustache offers a complex portrait of a mysterious and mercurial artist.

Eustache, who made his mark on French cinema with The Mother and the Whore (1973) and committed suicide eight years later, is said to have revealed more of himself on-screen than in real life. As a consequence, this 52-minute documentary by Angel Diaz takes a mosaic approach, combining clips from Eustache's work, voice-over excerpts from his writings, and recollections from noted collaborators (Jean-Pierre Leaud, Francois Lebrun, Jean-Michel Barjol). Some of Eustache's statements are surprising (the great renegade once said he wanted to return to the 19th-century origins of the cinema), but he remains a mysterious figure; whatever his sorrows were, they seem to have been lost for good.
