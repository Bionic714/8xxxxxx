Video is 720x404 @ 1477 kbps bitrate.
Audio is 133 kbps 48khz 2-channel.

If you just missed the show and want to see and hear it, this is a good downbload. 

However if you're planning to watch this at your high end home cinema and want to get the feeling of almost being there - look around for a higer quality verson. "
,Jannis86,2013-05-20T17:03Z,"However, i have to add;
If only that fucking retarded UK monkey of a commenter in the show would have just shut up this whole video would have been probably twice as good. 
Not only is he negative on many things during the show, but he also talks almost constantly. Even at the very end during the replay of the final winner song that asswipe keeps talking instead of letting you hear the song..."
