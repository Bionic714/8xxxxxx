pdf book.

This is for learning english, but absolutely works backwards too for learning german. Perfect parallel sets of words each used in a sentence. 

This is a very well written, well organized, attractive and useable book, awesome for improving german or english!!!

I own the real book, and was about to scan the whole thing for travelling lightly, but I just found the real deal online. 

Please seed a while, I am on the road a lot so cannot maintain it easily.
