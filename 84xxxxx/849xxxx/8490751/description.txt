After Knife Party released their Haunted House Ep, I, among others were disappointed to see that Baghdad was replaced by the Internet Friends VIP. So, I searched and searched and found this professional remake of Baghdad and decided to put it up here for you all to enjoy. 

And Remember, the more you seed, the more others will download and like Knife Party's work.

PS credits for the remake should go to Blaynoize.
