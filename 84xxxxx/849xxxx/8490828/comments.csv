,EmailMyPants,2013-05-19T23:59Z,How do I run it? Doesn't this need a crack to run it?
,Easipak,2013-05-20T00:15Z,"Extract and run. Choose between 32bit and 64bit versions, depending on which OS you have. No crack needed."
,LeagueOfDraven,2013-05-20T04:46Z,Was trying to run it but it requires a password to access when you get in.
,Easipak,2013-05-20T05:13Z,"Nonsense. No login or password is required, this is straight from theindiestone forums, still zipped. I've been playing this for a week on W7 pro 32bit."
,egclocknload,2013-05-20T06:08Z,Asking for login
,Easipak,2013-05-20T07:44Z,"Two people have reported a login - though I have not seen it. As I said, this is my second week playing it. And I run the 32bit version, as I have W7 32bit. To be more specific: theindiestone linked to moddb, which then linked to gamefront, where I got it. So for me, everything is working just splendid, without bugs so far. And if indeed a login is encoded, then I give you my apologies. Lastly, check out the link in the description, and always be specific, like for instance, what did the login look like? And which OS are you using?"
,nikysan,2013-05-20T08:19Z,"Have to create an account just to post this. Needed a ""Desura Key"" or ""gmail/paypal"" username & Login.

Tried PZ32 and PZ64, safemode files and batch files.

Pressing ""Login"" with no key or a randomly typed key for Desura gives a login failed.

Windows 7, 64 Bit"
,ForbiddenSoul,2013-05-20T09:52Z,"I'm also getting the key required message in both x86 and x64. I went to the theindiestone forums, and got RC2.9 Build 0007, it too also asks for a desura key, or your googlecheckout/paypal info. (I would defiantly not give it to them). Ill comment again If I find a fix..."
,ForbiddenSoul,2013-05-20T10:35Z,"use the crack from this torrent and you will bypass the key screen

,Easipak,2013-05-20T17:12Z,"I'm terribly sorry about the login, as there really seems to be one. For me, it works, and hopefully so, for others like me as well..."
,Easipak,2013-05-20T19:45Z,"Any confirmation on people, who like me, do not get the login screen? Otherwise I have failed you, and this torrent is useless, and will be deleted. If you do get the login screen, try ForbiddenSoul's pre-cracked torrent instead: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8493136/Project_Zomboid_RC2.9_(Build_0007)_Pre-Cracked"
,enterthenamehere,2013-05-21T01:49Z,"Did You bought the buy the game and/or already entered the login info before/previous version? Then it would probably be saved and you won't get the login dialog, because it will load the saved login info.

However if You run it for first time, it will display/require login info."
,ForbiddenSoul,2013-05-21T05:14Z,"You didn't fail Easipak! Testing releases can be a bitch. I would of never even heard of this game if it wasn't for you so thanks!

The reason it works for you and not others, is you need to have a "".key"" file in your %USERPROFILE%Zomboid directory. You must already of had one. My Installer just adds the key from http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7456682/ automatically.

Thanks again dude, keep up the good work!"
