Marvelo, the "Monarch of Magicians," is a heroic spell-caster who can accomplish almost anything, including intangibility, with a casual flick of the wrist and a few magic incantations. He uses his powers to fight crime and injustice against enemies such as the evil Eastern mage Ramun and Edpo, his trained ape, and Guran. He was accompanied by his Chinese servant, Zee.
