It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly
but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected
yet again for military service. Everything changes when
Dr. Erskine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth.
Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience,
Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is
suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential.
When Dr. Erskine is then immediately assassinated by an
agent of Nazi Germany's secret HYDRA research department
(headed by Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. the Red Skull), Rogers
is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a
propaganda mascot; however, when his comrades need him,
Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes
him Captain America, and his war against Schmidt begins.
