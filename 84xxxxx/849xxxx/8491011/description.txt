Chef! The Complete Series.  I could not find this on TPB a few weeks ago so I got it from elsewhere and figured I would share it.  This is my first torrent.  I can't think of a better show to pop my torrent-cherry with.

Ripped from DVD using good ol' DVD Shrink with no compression.  Used Handbrake to transcode to H.264 .mkv container with decomb filter on at constant quality 20.  I think the file size for quality ratio is good.  Each episode is about 200MB

Enjoy!
