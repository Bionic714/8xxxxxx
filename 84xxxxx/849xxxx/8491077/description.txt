VATTA'S WAR
Ky Vatta, daughter of the wealthy and powerful trading family, chose to leave the family business and attend Spaceforce Academy...but in her final semester, she makes an error of judgment and is expelled. Her family puts her aboard an old tub of a spaceship, and tells her to take it off to the scrapyards-Ky looks for something better to do, and ends up in what seems to be a pirate attack on the planet where she's buying farm equipment.
