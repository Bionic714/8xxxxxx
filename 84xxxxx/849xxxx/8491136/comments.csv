,Twitch8722,2013-06-04T01:31Z,"I didn't download this one as not sure about uploader (No offence). I got mine from the link below. It's [eztv] and works perfectly, also commented there. Doesn't show up during typical search such as ""Elementary S01E23"" but if you search ""Elementary S01E23E24"" then it does in case you're one of those who doesn't trust random links, lol.

I have no reason to doubt this torrent but I stick to what I know which is [eztv].

Hope this helps anyone that's unsure.
