Africa Megaflyover
Mike Fay was on a mission: Find out where people are in Africa, how they're impacting the natural environment, and how they're managing the land. So, with two small planes and a tenacious spirit, the explorer and conservationist took to the skies for a six-month aerial survey of the continent. Join him as he gathers answers to his questions and discovers what Africans can teach the rest of us about living in harmony with wildlife.
