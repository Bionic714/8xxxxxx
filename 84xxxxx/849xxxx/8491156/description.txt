This is the best copy of Jackie Chan's "New Police Story" that I could find, re-encoded by me. The original was made of 2 AVI files at 700mb each and there were 2 sub-title files, one for each. I baked in the sub-titles, then joined the 2 AVI's together so now you get the whole movie in 1 file with full English subs. I even did some spelling and grammar fixes on the sub-titles but since I don't speak Chinese, I could only do my best at fixing the English mistakes.
