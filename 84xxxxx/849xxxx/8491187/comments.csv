¿Fake?

¿How do i install it on goty?"
,whiteorc,2013-05-20T13:51Z,can someone point to a civ 5 gods and kings torrent that will work with those patches?
,reggadej,2013-05-20T16:29Z,"It's legit, no viruses detected.

However, as of the update I experience frequent crashes. Anyone knows why or having the same problem?"
,whiteorc,2013-05-20T16:39Z,"Its no use if its not working with goty. I tried with revolt goty+gods version, installed 1.705 then 2.21 and 2.24 and its NOT working. Waiting for someone to tell me what torrent(s) are needed for those 2 patches."
,reggadej,2013-05-20T16:55Z,"whiteorc:
How do you mean it's not working? Does it crash on startup?"

Then my 1.0.1.705 torrent, listed on the description and this torrent."
,jack_mustang,2013-05-20T18:43Z,"Ah fucking Android. I hate when you make me double post.

Anyway if having trouble read the NOT WORKING? section in description."
,reggadej,2013-05-20T19:44Z,"jack_mustang:

Does this work with Nvidia, windows 7 and directx 11?"
,whiteorc,2013-05-20T21:11Z,"thank you for the answer, i will try your torrents as soon as i can."
,reggadej,2013-05-20T21:46Z,"Tried the uploader's setup, still doesn't work. Since this update, the game crashes whenever i try to start a new game (after the leader intro speech). tried numerous fixes to no avail :("
,jack_mustang,2013-05-21T00:49Z,"@reggadej
Apart from running as admin and/or changing the civ5 folder permission, I have no more possible solutions."
,whiteorc,2013-05-21T08:54Z,"still cant get the game to start, i get a chinese message of some sort about steam and the game its not even starting. oh well"
,kaliver,2013-05-22T02:44Z,"the ""chinese message of some sort"" is telling you to fucking close steam first."
,jack_mustang,2013-05-22T02:50Z,"At KAT DSpectre86 got it working with these torrents:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7047491/

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7375083/

He installed all and only the updates I listed earlier by 3DM."
,noends,2013-05-22T02:56Z,"@whiteorc
Try closing Steam and then launch the game. I had the same problem and that fixed it."
,whiteorc,2013-05-23T08:34Z,"It was indeed that stupid steam, too bad my chinese level is 0 lol. Thank you very much for the torrent jack_mustang and for the help. "
,gunstock187,2013-05-27T19:44Z,"This is great! it didn't work at first, crashed on start screen but then i ran as admin and i haven't had any problems..ty uploader!"
,pilot00,2013-06-03T00:11Z,I cant seem to get it working. No admin problems had the game installed and working perfectly up to prior patches. Reinstalled and dl the suggested torrents. Still nothing. I click the game to start and it simply does not respond.
,pilot00,2013-06-03T16:53Z,"Got it to work...barely....
I used the Simon torrent in the links. What I got to is a loading screen of CiV vanilla and unsurprising missing all the DLCs (along with errors for missing textures), will retry with another version. In the interim any help/advice is appreciated."
,pilot00,2013-06-03T23:00Z,Yup got it working! Only now it doesn't load games... :(
,crABtoad,2013-06-06T20:34Z,"seems to be 100% working...  using REVOLT release main game, 1.0.1.674 3DM crackfix, 1.0.1.705 3DM patch and this torrent. "
,pilot00,2013-06-07T17:01Z,Well its working now after a couple uninstalls and reinstalls. However all I can load is saves made on steam cloud. The rest simply freeze. Any ideas?
