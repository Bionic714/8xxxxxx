Here's another one I dug up from the basement...play by play radio broadcasts of

the Big Red Machine 1970 up to and including some play by play from the playoffs 

with Pittsburgh Pirates and the World Series with the Baltimore Orioles...all in

great quality...I don't know if anyone has this album or even heard this album...

so if you are a baseball fan you are gonna want to get this...Brooks Robinson

making fantastic plays at 3rd base to rob the Reds of the Series...Joe Nuxall and

Jim McIntire call the play by play...Enjoy!
