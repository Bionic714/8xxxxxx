2 hours was more than enough, but she was repeating herself and testimony by the third hour. Overkill as usual.   It's too bad Randi doesn't interview people on her show."
[T],480v,2013-05-21T13:19Z,"Yeah I might as well. As if commercials weren't bad enough, why subject listeners to hourly Fox News reports and plugs for Hannity? I know it would drive me nuts.

Of all the liberal talkers I upload, Randi is by far the most downloaded. I notice this every time. Of course the count is downright negligible when compared to more popular torrents, ie, movies, music, tv shows, etc. but there's no doubt about it...she's the most favored. For now it's the only reason why I'm still uploading her even though I said I won't. But after almost 4 yrs, you should know me by now. I'm always changing my mind.

When i said I haven't heard Randi for awhile...it was the truth. I do hear what she's talking about when I work on the mp3s, but as far as actually listening to her show, I stopped when she was ranting about Ted Nugent. "
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-21T14:50Z,4 years?  It's closer to 2.  Some guy named Brian Stuhr and another person were uploading progressive talk shows to TPB such as this before you.  But your ongoing efforts are appreciated!
[T],480v,2013-05-23T01:50Z,"I stand corrected. It's been almost three years. Apparently I started in 2010. I thought I began at the end of 2009, but it was DBaum, Sonews and Lonefunman. I don't know Brian."
