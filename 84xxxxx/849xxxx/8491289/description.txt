It's Friday, ya bastids!


At a hearing today, acting IRS commissioner Steven Miller today said that the targeting of Tea Party groups was due to ΓÇ£foolish mistakes.ΓÇ¥ ThatΓÇÖs not trueΓÇöit wasnΓÇÖt foolish, and it shouldnΓÇÖt be considered a mistake. Someone at the IRS decided that if they were looking for groups with a political agenda instead of a social welfare agenda, maybe they should look at groups with ΓÇ£partyΓÇ¥ in their name. ThatΓÇÖs not exactly foolish.

The very inspector generalΓÇÖs report that brought this whole IRS thing to light stated that there was no evidence of political motivation or White House involvement. Republicans will have to rewrite that like they rewrote the Benghazi talking points. Douglas Shulman, who was running the IRS when this was going on, is an appointee of George W. Bush. If Republicans want to tie the IRS story to the White House, theyΓÇÖll have to tie it to the Bush White House.

If anyone is going to target Tea Party groups, theyΓÇÖre going to hit the Koch brothers, since theyΓÇÖre propping up almost all of those organizations. Together, the Koch brothers are worth $68 billion. That can buy an awful lot of powdered wigs, anti-Obama signs, and elections. The scandal isnΓÇÖt that Tea Party groups were being given extra scrutiny by the IRS. The scandal is that Tea Party groups arenΓÇÖt scrutinized enoughΓÇª by anybody.

The 501(c)(4) scam means that the Koch brothers arenΓÇÖt just using the Tea Party idiots that they dupeΓÇötheyΓÇÖre using every American taxpayer. As Frank Rich said, ΓÇ£The Koch brothers must be laughing all the way to the bank knowing that working Americans are aiding and abetting their selfish interests.ΓÇ¥ And theyΓÇÖre really laughing when they fill out their tax exempt status forms. The Koch brothers are ripping off every American who pays taxesΓÇöwhich is basically everybody except for their billionaire pals. We shouldnΓÇÖt be investigating what was done to the Tea Party, we should be investigating what the Tea Party has done.

Just how crazy can conservatives get in their reactions to the IRS story? As always, the answer to that question is ΓÇ£What is Michele Bachmann saying?ΓÇ¥ Michele thinks that recent developments on the IRS mean that Christians will be denied healthcare. If you wonder how she got there, rememberΓÇöMichele isnΓÇÖt starting at the same place as the rest of us. Michele said that after this weekΓÇÖs IRS hearings ΓÇ£Now it is reasonable to ask could there potentially be political implications regarding healthcare, access to healthcare, denial of healthcare?ΓÇ¥ First of all, Michele, you are no authority on what is reasonable in any situation. And she adds ΓÇ£Will that happen based upon a personΓÇÖs political beliefs or their religiously held beliefs?ΓÇ¥ Michele is that what you took away from this weekΓÇÖs hearings? All I took away was ΓÇ£Louie Gohmert is a lunatic.ΓÇ¥
