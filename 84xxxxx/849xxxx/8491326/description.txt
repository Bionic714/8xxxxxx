Live at Piacenza Theatre with the Italian Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir of Piacenza performing music by Marcel Khalife. 

Conductor: Karl Martin, Chorus Master: Corado Casati. 

The live recording of Marcel Khalife's latest composition "Sharq". A fusion of East and West, old and new, Sharq (Orient) is the placement of Eastern melody and its unique expressiveness in a new context that propels it forward as a complete medium of expression. Combining elements of mawwal, tarab, muwashah, samai, qadd, longa, and sufi, this concert recording is a unique musical biography."
