,dipdinger,2013-05-20T17:21Z,"I don't get what the point in spoiling the movie for everyone is? you're just being a douche

ANYWAYS..this is a sexy version of the movie. Close to dvd with some noticeable dips in quality, however the up-loader should be given HUGE props for the amount of work involved. This is the best version out there. 

1 being a giant turnd nugget and 10 being a dvd rip:

V/10: 8.7
A/10: 7.5"

,MrSmartyPants,2013-05-20T23:28Z,What's a spoiler?
,NerdLife,2013-05-20T23:57Z,"This was without a doubt, the worst Iron Man of the series. A damn shame...

Also

Audio: 5/10 has crackling and sounds like someone is masturbating to some BBW pr0n

Video: 4.5/10 great quality in some areas, but lacks good quality during action sequences. 

Overall: Worst Iron Man of series + Crap quality = Wait for DVD/Blu-Ray"

,jadawgkss,2013-05-23T06:52Z,"Thank you so much guys! This is a really great copy. I'm not so sure it's that much different from a DVDRip. It begins where the DVD track would begin, ends after all the credits, and there is no laughing at funny parts like you'd hear in a cam. This is the real deal. 10/10 for your effort! 

Now, if we could only get the same treatment for Star Trek and The Great Gatsby, I'd be a changed man! (That sounds ungrateful, so let me clarify: thanks a million!)"
,Xenirina,2013-05-23T08:16Z,"Seems the dude from CM8 did a whole lot of work on this... and it shows.

Great quality for what it is. As pointed out previously, there's a few sketchy bits of audio at some points, but it only lasts for an average of 10 seconds, then it passes.

V: 7/10
A: 6.5/10

Nothing like seeing a hero have repeated panic attacks, cry, whine, piss and moan for 2 hours..

Definitely awesome to watch one of Iron Man's greatest villians be turned into some drunken drugged up retard ""actor.""  (yes, that was sarcasm.)

This was a 2 hour turd, and completely shits all over the canon already laid out.. fucking waste of space "
,radiotryne,2013-05-30T03:53Z,"Seriously, I don't get why people hate on this cam version.

i understand that there is no problem regarding expressing your opinion about the quality, but please put it in nice words. have you ever heard the word ""Constructive criticism"" 

the author clearly stated that it is an R6 HDScr. so think of it as HD among R6 category of videos. so how come you expect to watch a theaterLike video? thats why video classifications are made.  and above all, it's FREE. 

BTW, if you doesnt like it, i have pieces of unsolicited advice for you. that is.you can either wait.for BluRay to come out nextyear or.watch it in theaters!

You little shitheads think it's your right to have these free movies, it aint! Shutup, download, seed and then bugger off. I think I will have some supporters. If you don't want to end up in tears over a few photo spoilers, don't look at pictures, I have been using TPB for many years and have never looked at one image... the simple reason being, it's too easy to post nice pictures or take shots from good parts of the movie so I wouldn't bother trusting what you see. How many of you little snotty nosed school kids will actually appreciate the free movie anyway? You've grown up getting all this stuff for free and now you expect it. You also grew up being able to say whatever you want to anyone you like because you are in the safety of your bedroom, how lame is that, tough guys eh!  I don't like you and neither does the rest of the normal downloaders here, that's obvious.

,rublazin12,2013-06-11T04:12Z,You can tell a lot of work went into getting this out in such clarity. It is in no way close to Blueray quality - so if this is a must see movie for you in 1080 HD with the Dolby Surround and all that biz - then wait for the Blueray file to come (usually shortly after the public release). Or just flat out go to see it at the theatre. I am usually a stickler for seeing movies like this in full quality. In this case I just was too cheap to pay and could not wait lol! It was surprisingly very enjoyable and didnt miss a scene or a line. Id honestly give it  A/6.5    V/7
