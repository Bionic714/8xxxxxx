The Prisoners s01e1-e3 - criminal heroin and crack users


Series following offenders in prison, their release and, if they re-offend, their return behind prison doors. Filmed over a year, this first episode follows a group of repeat offenders from Holloway prison, which holds over four hundred female prisoners. Jayde is just 18 but has already been in jail six times. Stuck in a cycle of reoffending, she manages just two weeks outside before returning to Holloway. Crystal feels at home in prison; now 23, she has been a regular inmate at Holloway prison since she was 17. On release she returns to her estate but, fearing this environment will cause her to relapse, she leaves in order to address her problems. While each journey is different, nearly all share a shocking truth that many offenders feel more at home in prison than out
