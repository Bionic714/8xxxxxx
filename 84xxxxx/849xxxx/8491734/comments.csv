(1) change the ""cbz"" extension to ""zip""
(2) extract the individual images
(3) relabel pages ""(1) - (9)"" to ""(01) - (09)""
(4) re-compress the individual images to a ""zip"" file
(5) change the ""zip"" extension to ""cbz""

Really sorry about this; I was still getting the hang of making these."
