,kattgamble,2013-05-20T04:36Z,Thank you ettv.  I got the download from eztv first and he made it password protected due to hacker activity.  I was pretty bummed; you had to do surveys to download password.  My husband was pretty angry.  Thanks to you we won't have to depend on ez.....you are awesome.  Thanks again!!!

,lolly_h,2013-05-20T07:53Z,"@carfoil - maybe they're ""easing into it"" and up until the last couple of eps they were sticking pretty close to the books so they're just working with what they've got - but now with the whole kidnapping Gendry thing who knows…"
,hrector,2013-05-20T08:04Z,"since our savior darkizzle has decided to take a leave of absence, I'll try to replicate the majestic beauty behind his comments:

It's a shame that Sansa decided to turn to Rh'lorr to bring her father back to life, seems weird to see Ned with his head decapitated. Also, it's a nice surprise to see Benjen come back as a whitewalker. Though a shame he had to kill Samwell "

,waldorfx,2013-05-20T13:58Z,"@lucifertenebrae, Oh, and btw. Game Of Thrones is following the Third book so far. Season 3 is supposed to cover about half the third book. And there are six.. and a seventh to come. Jah bless, ettv"

Tiny audio issue, though, the end title music breaks off after a second or so, followed by the HBO sound. Not a big deal, just thought I'd mention it."
,tdurden83,2013-05-20T21:00Z,"thx for the ul. the show is great, and has stayed true to the books for the most part, but this season has definitely taken more liberties. I heard they were going to spend 2 seasons on the third book too, but seeing the way they skip some parts, and take short-cuts with others, make it seem like they are in a hurry to get through it. I try not to be that guy who bitches if everything isn't just like the book, and I give them credit for doing an awesome job fitting in as much as they do. there are just some things that I don't understand the reason behind leaving out or changing. I just hope they don't rush through so much that they eventually end up stuck waiting for grrm to finish another book  "

,RufusChainsaw,2013-05-22T03:27Z,"(my comment has nothing to do with the torrent)

@tdurden83
 I was really upset that they cut the big Tyrion battle scene from Season 1 Episode 9. This was supposed to be a defining moment for everyone's favourite dwarf and changes the character ever so slightly in the TV show. The producers apparently ran out of money towards the end of the season and could not afford the battle choosing to instead add filler content which created certain deviations in the story line that are now becoming apparent. 

I heard that the overall story arcs will be solid though and there is no real way for them to stay true to such epic books so a pretty decent effort overall I think. Keep in mind this is an entire universe they have had to make from scratch! Maybe one day they will remake stories like this exactly as described in books."
,Damien74,2013-05-23T12:22Z,axo666: thank you for the info on the bad audio in the end! I will download another release. Thank you!!!
,mh505,2013-05-23T21:47Z,"yeah, with every episode they are getting further away from the original. What a pity .."
