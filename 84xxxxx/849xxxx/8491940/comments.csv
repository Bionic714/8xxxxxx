,ChocoROID,2013-05-20T11:45Z,"@Bring_Back_Demonoid

Seeders are people who have the full file and are seeding.

Leechers are people who don't yet have the full file, they are still seeding what parts of the file they have.


AKA leechers are a good thing, more the merrier. Shut your face and stop complaining, it's free.
There is no better place to download than TBP."
,loginsignup,2013-05-20T12:30Z,"Nice torrent, but it takes time because no one is seeding, but everyone is leeching ! 

Thanks for upload :) / Dk"
