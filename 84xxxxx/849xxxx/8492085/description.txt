The Complete Discography Of Jay Electronica. Jay Elect has a much larger catalog than even a lot of his biggest fans recognize. This is because he has no official mixtapes or albums, so it can be tough to gather all of his loose tracks. This collection includes EVERY track and verse that has ever been released by Jay Electronica to this point, as well as exclusive abridged (shortened) versions of some of his featured tracks that you wonΓÇÖt find anywhere else. Find the details of JayΓÇÖs Discography and the tracklist below.

It consists of 93 total tracks, including 68 solo tracks and 25 features. The 68 solo tracks also include some rough quality releases, a couple freestyles, and abridged versions of Act I, broken down in several ways as you will see in the tracklist. The 25 features also includes abridged versions of many tracks, where IΓÇÖve cut the song to only have Jay ElectronicaΓÇÖs verse and the chorus to the track, for people like me who only want to hear Jay Elect. These were exclusively created for this release.
