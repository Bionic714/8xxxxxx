With Castle Dark now back in the hands of the Fables, mysteries both young and old begin to challenge the residents of Fabletown.  Bigsby and Stinky set off from Fabletown in Rose Red's blood-fueled sports car to track down the two abducted cubs.  Unfortunately for Snow White, besides suffering the trauma of having two of her cubs go missing, a long forgotten secret uncovered in Castle Dark threatens to sabotage her and Bigsby's marriage.
