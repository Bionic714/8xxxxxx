,phattyhope,2013-05-25T20:54Z,"both of these videos, part 1 and 2 have some very annoying clipping in the video, hd is great, but its very unwatchable in my opinion. sucks, cause this series rocks!"
,phattyhope,2013-05-25T21:10Z,is there a way to adjust VLC player to play these HD videos without the clipping? or is there another player that would be better for this format?
