Don Byas - 2000 - Laura (1950-52)

Don Byas was a giant of the tenor sax, though his accomplishments were all but overlooked in his native land once he moved to Europe for good. This CD from Universal Music's Jazz in Paris series compiles three separate studio sessions from the early '50s, all with different rhythm sections. Most of the tracks are standard ballads, featuring the leader throughout. His expressive take of "Laura" shows off a big tone with a bit of vibrato much like Ben Webster in his later years. The one original is his snappy "Riviera Blues," a lively number likely improvised on the spot. Had he remained in the U.S., it is possible that Don Byas might have been ranked along with Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, and Ben Webster in the top echelon of tenor saxophonists, so anyone unfamiliar with his work should seek out this very affordable collection.
