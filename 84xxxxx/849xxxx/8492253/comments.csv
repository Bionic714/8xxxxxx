i may need to mention that you need to uninstall any previous versions of driver genius you have had on your pc. That would be the issue why it isn't working same thing happens to a friend of mine.. he had to uninstall the version he had, and run advanced registry def rag to clean the system, then worked perfect :) So to anyone having issues that should fix the issue, if not let me know :)"
