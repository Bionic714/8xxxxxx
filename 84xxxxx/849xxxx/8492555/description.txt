Bringing the Summer
By Julia Green



It's the lazy end of summer and Freya is about to start her A levels. Her brother Joe died a year ago, but she is slowly coming to terms with his death. She is beginning to feel ready for something new - a change. And then a railway accident brings her by chance into contact with the gorgeous Gabes. Freya is drawn not just to Gabes himself and his blond good looks, but everything about him, including his large, shambolic, warm and loving family, which seems to Freya so different to her own family of three.

 And then Gabes' clearly troubled older brother makes it clear he is interested in Freya - and Freya has some decisions to make about what she really wants.
