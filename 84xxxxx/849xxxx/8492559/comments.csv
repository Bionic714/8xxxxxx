Total time for installation including unpacking of files - 20 minutes

NOTE : Game EXE File version - 1.0.447.0 (latest as of May 29th 2013)

1) Ran EXE and tried to do a benchmark - crashed to desktop

2) Ran EXE and tried to start the game directly - crashed to desktop again

3) Right clicked the desktop shortcut and under ""compatibility"" tab, chose option ""Run as administrator"". Clicked ""Apply"" & ""OK"" and tried to start the game again - SUCCESS !!! :)

Works beautifully on Windows 8 64 Bit. Benchmark gives me 45 FPS average on a Core i3 system with an NVIDIA 660 Ti card at ""MEDIUM"" graphic settings. Game looks quite stunning ! 

Thanks uploader !! "

,netter2k,2013-06-09T08:14Z,"Hey everyone... I've been so focused on the game after i downloaded it that i never came back to check the comments after leaving my initial ones. It's working fine on Windows 8 64-Bit and i have now upped the graphics settings to ""ULTRA"". Get around 40 FPS with Texture Filter kept at ""2X"". The game looks gorgeous indeed!

To answer some questions above:

@rayhdp : That looks like a messed up installation. Uninstall. Restart. Make sure all your DirectX and other OS files are up-to-date and then reinstall. Should work fine.

@b3spirit :  I believe in this version of the game, the save game location is different then in the regualr ""Skidrow"" versions. In this game, I'm pretty certain the file is called ""HM5"" without any extension and it is located at : ""C:Program Files (x86)Hitman Absolution""   (I have Windows 8 64-Bit)"
,netter2k,2013-06-09T08:17Z,"Oh and add the ""  "" backslash signs between ""Program Files (x86)"" and ""Hitman Absolution"". Don't know why PirateBay won't allow the path to show correctly in the comments... but i guess you understand what i mean"
,eskimper,2013-06-13T12:20Z,"Friendly reminder: If you get the game in Russian, simply uninstall and re-install. When you start installation again click Next > Components. Switch to English. Great torrent!"
