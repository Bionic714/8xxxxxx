its a old series after all.. recorded on production tapes and non widescreen.. "
[V],psspss,2013-05-20T09:21Z,"the Disc has 2 extras as well..

1 special and 1 called Heroine.. I guess it was unaired? and perhaps going to make a new series with the girl being the super hero?"
[V],psspss,2013-05-20T09:23Z,Note I seed it a little but will have to come back in 5 hours sorry about that.. waiting for a isp reset!

you can get the missing Season 2 and 3 here but they are tvrips not dvd Sources and not many seeding either
just untick for download the Season 1 in the utorrent add panel or in the files table right click and say dont download.. note they called the heroine special Season 3 special wrongly as was on dvd 3 for season 1
