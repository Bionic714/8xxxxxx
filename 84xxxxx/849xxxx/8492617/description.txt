All Xvids 400mb range from true DVD source unlike the TV ripos floating about

Note! I will add now and Seed in 5 hours.. when I have more DATA cap
sorry for the wait but we can see how many want this OLD CLASSIC SciFI crime
series still

Episode one He gets a suit of special powers when they get contacted by
a UFO


I dont have S02 or S03 DVDa though.

one episode think it was Ep4 had some bad sectors and a few seconds of corruption
in a car chase seen.. nothing major seems to play in VLC and streamed to xbmc on pc



ENJOY and HELP SEED its a big 4.5gb so I cant do it alone.. if a fan or want
to share this Scifi then HELP dont leech.
