Book Description:


No longer on the outermost fringe of the food world, the raw food diet is becoming increasingly mainstream as its health benefits have become clearer and celebrities such as Demi Moore become enthusiastic converts.

Eager to show that a diet that includes a high percentage of raw foods is not difficult to achieve, chefs Peter and Beryn Daniel created this beautiful, accessible cookbook and guide to raw kitchen basics. Rawlicious introduces readers to a lifestyle that marries long-term health benefits and higher energy levels with delicious and simple raw recipes.

Rawlicious covers a broad spectrum of recipes and raw principles, from basics like stocking your raw kitchen, juicing, salad preparation, and making smoothies, to more advanced, gourmet dishes. Stunning full-color photos throughout will inspire readers to get into their kitchen, and clear, easy instructions to 144 recipes will encourage them to stay.

In South Africa, where Rawlicious was published in August 2009, readers have enthusiastically embraced the book as their ΓÇ£kitchen bible,ΓÇ¥ their primary raw food resource above all others. Clean design and clear explanations of raw food principles and recipes make this one of the most inviting raw recipe books on the market. The new edition offers both U.S. and metric measurements for an international audience.
