The objective of FUNDAMENTALS OF MECHATRONICS is to cover both hardware and software aspects of mechatronics systems in a single text, giving a complete treatment to the subject matter. The text focuses on application considerations and relevant practical issues that arise in the selection and design of mechatronics components and systems. The text uses several programming languages to illustrate the key topics. Different programming platforms are presented to give instructors the choice to select the programming language most suited to their course objectives. A separate laboratory book, with additional exercises is provided to give guided hands-on experience with many of the topics covered in the text.
