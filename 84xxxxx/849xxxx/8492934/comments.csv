I have been trying to get this movie in the English version for years and was delighted to see someone finally uploaded it, however after burning it to disc it seems that the English audio track dosen't line up with the video. The 3 stories play correct audio when playing the Italian audio but when switching tracks to English, the 3 stories play in different order than the English audio. The Italian audio plays stories 1-2 and then 3 like it should but the English audio plays stories 3-2 and then 1. Could someone please please please figure out how to fix this keeping the quality the same and let me know? Or maybe fix it and upload it again? Thanks sooo much!"
,Gritzen,2013-05-22T05:05Z,Well there are two different cuts of this film. 1 is an Italian cut and the other is the US AIP cut. There are quite a few differences including order re-arrangement between the two cuts so there is no way that the English and Italian audio can be applied to just one cut or this upload. There needs to be a completely separate upload of the US AIP cut. If the Italian audio in syncing up with this upload than this must be the Italian cut. Maybe Rovers can upload the AIP version too.
,jafojeff,2013-05-22T07:00Z,That would be great! Do you think they might read this post? If there were a DVDR available do you think the English audio would match then? I have the original API VHS video of this that's in English but of course the picture quality isn't good. Thanks for your help.
,TheLathe,2013-05-23T03:29Z,"Yep, I just noticed this too; probably the poster didn't realize the sequence difference in the two versions.

The reviews that I read about the Blu-ray seem to suggest that the soundtrack that goes with the Italian version in more 'Goth & Jazzy', so fortunately that sounds like just watching the Italian version with the English subs is likely the better choice anyway  : )

Thanks!"
