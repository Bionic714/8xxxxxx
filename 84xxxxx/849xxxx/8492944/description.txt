Tennessee Home Brew [1947-1953] Bear Family CD (2010)


This generously full collection of painstakingly restored original masters includes all 18 songs issued by Big Jeff between 1947 and 1952, eight songs from live WLAC radio broadcasts in the mid-1950s, three unissued demos, and more! Plus an 88-page booklet by Martin Hawkins telling the fascinating story of Big Jeff Bess for the very first time, featuring unpublished interviews with seven of The Radio Playboys, and many rare photographs from the 1940s and '50s. 

Back before Nashville was Nashville, Big Jeff Bess was a Nashville legend. He sold beer, cure-all tonics, and baby chicks on local radio and made some of the purest hillbilly, swingin'est honky tonk, rockin'est country music of all time. Now the story is told in words and fabulously rare music. Jeff also owned a number of clubs, the most famous of which was Tootsie's Orchid Lounge. A legendary musicians' hangout, Tootsie's is still in business and still a Nashville landmark!
