,So_NY,2013-05-21T05:55Z,Thanks! Can you upload Outkast & Dungeon Family discography?
[T],gotfw,2013-05-21T13:40Z,No I'm not doing the dungeon family stuff. That's way too much and you should really search for stuff online before posting a request on every torrent I post. I know it's you Slow_Jamzz you didn't have to create a new account. I will only do outkast's discography.
