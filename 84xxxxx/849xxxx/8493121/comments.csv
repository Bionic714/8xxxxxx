Second, am after a program titled

Atomic Whois Explorer

Trying to get ahold of a reg'ed version, if you might be able to have a search with your contacts would be much appreciated my friend, thankyou"

I greatly admire your work and your astonishing dedication to Scene releasing!

My only observation is that could you please consider not unpacking or repacking the Scene releases - release them ""as is"" in the format they were released in by the release groups themselves.

The downloaders/co-seeders will just have to work out how to use 7-Zip, WinZip or WinRAR on multi-part archives - it's not rocket science.

Suck it up princesses or die hard trying. :-)

And it would be far less work for you as well!

Best regards,

Core"
