,issacweirdo,2013-05-31T12:00Z,"The first two episodes did not work for me. Got 11 seconds into the first video before it crashed. Tried it with VLC and Freesmith player. PC is pretty good and can definitely handle HD playback, so my PC is not the problem.

Otherwise the rest of the episodes played without any error."
