That's right, Warner Bros. finally released Animaniacs Volume 4 with the 25 missing episodes that fans have been demanding for years. It took a long time, but I finally compiled every episode of my favorite cartoon growing up into one collection. 

Season 1 (1993-1994)
Season 2 (1994)
Season 3 (1995-1997)
Season 4 (1996)
Season 5 (1997-1998)

All 100 episodes including the 1999 direct-to-video movie 'Wakko's Wish' are here. There are even special DVD features from the first three volumes included. 
Episodes 1-74 are in .mkv format meaning you'll probably need VLC Media Player to watch them. 
Episodes 75-99 are in .mp4 format, which may or may not be a problem, but VLC is always the way to go.
