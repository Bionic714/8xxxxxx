Island Records released a remastered and redesigned version of Maladjusted on 4 May 2009. It included a new sleeve and track listing, several rare B-sides, and the first UK release of "Sorrow Will Come in the End". However, two songs ("Roy's Keen" and "Papa Jack") were left off the new track list. In the initial press release, "Ambitious Outsiders" was incorrectly listed as "Ambitious Lovers". It was released on the Polydor label.
