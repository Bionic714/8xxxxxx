Sweet-tart lime. Bright cherry. Creamy vanilla.
Natural sodas are vibrantly flavored with the zing of just-squeezed citrus juice, the sweetness of ripe berries, or the subtle perfume of fresh herbs. And with the popularity of countertop appliances that turn tap water into sparkling water, itΓÇÖs easier than ever to make the real thing in your own kitchen: simply mix a fresh soda syrup with bubbly water for a drink thatΓÇÖs as sweet (or not) as you likeΓÇöminus any artificial colors, flavors, or sweeteners.
In Make Your Own Soda, youΓÇÖll find 70 recipes for all-natural syrups with unique, artisanal flavors like pineapple, lemongrass, and hibiscus, as well as old-time favorites like ginger, sarsaparilla, and grape. YouΓÇÖll also find great ways to use homemade syrups to create soda fountain classics (Chocolate Egg Cream), great cocktails (Lovage Gin Fizz), and hot drinks (Hot Apple Spice Cup), all as delicious as they are distinctive.
