I merged 3 files totaling 22 minutes in about 6 minutes, oh yes, and the quality was spot on, love it, cheers."
,djpurity0,2013-05-22T05:59Z,"Holy shit the conversion is fast. The cheap or free ones you get take like an hour to convert one 5 minute video. Converted a video from FLV to MP4 that was 30 minutes long in one minute. Thought this torrent would be crap but it worked perfectly. Make sure you all go into the cracked folder after unzipping it and installing it and copy and paste the crack file into program files/iskysoft and click ""Copy and Replace"" for it to work. Thanks dude!"
