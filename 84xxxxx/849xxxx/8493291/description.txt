Monday 05-20-2013: Sir Alan Parker - Film director

Sir Alan Parker is one of Britain's most experienced and successful film directors. His work ranges from the stomach-churning realism of Midnight Express to the feel-good entertainment of Bugsy Malone and Fame. He has never cared much for film critics and has always held strong views on the future of the film industry. In this digital age, are movies as central to our culture as they used to be?
