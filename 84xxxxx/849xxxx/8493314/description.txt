Want to listen to your gods at work? Well, here you can, as the
fourth part of this recording is from the soundcheck, blessed
be me! (No, not me actually, because I wasn't the one standing
about with the Walkman unconspicuously hidden somewhere under
his T-shirt. But I might have been, so I graciously receive your
blessings.)

Technically, what you get here is ripped as-is from two cassettes,
one of them a CrO2, the other a somewhat. Somewhere on its way to
my tapes the recording got clipped, and sometimes you can clearly
hear what a worn-out tape sounds like. But that's live, isn't it?
No noise reduction or any other post processing have been applied
on my side, and you may want to adjust the balance a little, though
the difference between the two channels is hardly recognizable.
