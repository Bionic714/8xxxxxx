The second series about the Untouchables aired in 1993-1994 features Tom Amandes as Eliot Ness and William Forsythe as Al Capone.

This is a combination of dTVrip (excellent quality, and no logo) from German dub found on Usenet (thanks to Usenet Revolution), and English audio from unofficial American TV record. 

Audio synchronization completely made by me and my friends.
