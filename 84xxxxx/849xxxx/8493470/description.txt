Jim Hall - 1975 - Concierto (vinyl 24 96)
24 bit, 96 KHz vinyl rip.

Jim Hall's Concierto was arguably the greatest LP in the history of CTI; now that it has been reissued (for a second time as a CD), the improved sound and packaging plus three more new tracks eclipse the earlier CD reissue on CBS Associated. With Chet Baker, Roland Hanna and Paul Desmond, Hall is perfectly complemented. A master of melody who never wastes notes, the centerpiece for this release is Hall's interpretation of one movement from Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo's "Guitar Concerto," arranged by Don Sebesky. New tracks include alternate takes of "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "Rock Skippin'," plus "Unfinished Business," an incomplete track that fades following Desmond's solo just as Hall starts to play (This song is actually "La Paloma Azul," a Mexican folk tune played by Paul Desmond with the Dave Brubeck Quartet about a decade earlier, also known as "The Blue Dove").
