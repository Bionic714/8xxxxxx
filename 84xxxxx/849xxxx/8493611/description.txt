PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION
In the fourth edition of Basic Electrical Engineering, two more chapters have been added.
Chapter i on DC circuits explains the International System of Units and gives clear concepts of electrical circuits, current, voltage or potential, resistance, power and energy. Also, Ohm's law and Kirchoffs laws have been explained with a solution of series and parallel circuits using these laws.
Chapter ii on electromagnetic induction explains Faraday's laws of electromagnetic induction and Lenz's law. Laws of electromagnetic forces, dynamically and statically induced e.m.f. 's have also been explained. Further, concepts of mutual and self-inductances, and hysteresis losses and eddy current losses have been discussed.
Under AC circuits, in chapter 1, the concepts of leakage flux, fringing flux, magnetostatic potential, m.m.f. and reluctance have been included.
With these additions, the utility of this book has been greatly enhanced.
Any constructive suggestion for further improvement of this book will be gratefully acknowledged.
