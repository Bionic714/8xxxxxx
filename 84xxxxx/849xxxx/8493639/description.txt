To all intents, Wiltshire's Gabrielle Aplin came out of nowhere ΓÇô at the start of 2012, she was self-releasing feathery relationship ballads; by December, she was at No 1 with a cover of The Power of Love, as heard in the John Lewis Christmas ad. But before her breakthrough, this 20-year-old had spent years making her music market-ready. Thus, while her debut album tips its hat to her heroes (Joni Mitchell, Nick Drake et al), Aplin has funnelled most of her energies into pretty, pastel melodies and lyrics that will ping their way into the hearts of poetic 14-year-olds. At its best, English Rain (note that Drakeian title) works up a decent head of acoustic steam while dispensing perceptive relationship wisdom (the country-rocking Please Don't Say You Love Me counsels against saying the L-word too early because "under pressure precious things can break"). Sometimes, too, the purity of her voice carries the song; she's lovely when offset by a four-man gospel "choir" on Ready to Question. You do wade through a lot of blandness to get to the gems, though.
