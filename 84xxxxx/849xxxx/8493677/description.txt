 : Arduino Adventures: Escape from Gemini Station provides a fun introduction :
 : to the Arduino microcontroller by putting you (the reader) into the action :
 : of a science fiction adventure story.  You'll find yourself following along:
 : as Cade and Elle explore Gemini StationΓÇöan orbiting museum dedicated to    :
 : preserving and sharing technology throughout the centuries.                :
 :                                                                            :
 : Trouble ensues. The station is evacuated, including Cade and Elle's class  :
 : that was visiting the station on a field trip. Cade and Elle donΓÇÖt make it :
 : aboard their shuttle and are trapped on the station along with a friendly  :
 : artificial intelligence named Andrew who wants to help them get off the    :
 : damaged station. Using some old hardware, a laptop, and some toolboxes full:
 : of electronics parts, you will follow along and build eight gizmos with    :
 : Cade and Elle that will help them escape from Gemini Station.              :
 :                                                                            :
 : The hardware is Arduino. Each new challenge opens a new area of Arduino and:
 : basic electronics knowledge. YouΓÇÖll be taken incrementally from a simple   :
 : task such as turning on a light through to a complex combination of        :
 : microcontroller, electronic components, and software programming. By the   :
 : end of the book youΓÇÖll be well on your way towards being able to create and:
 : implement any sort of electronically controlled device you can imagine,    :
 : using the stunningly popular Arduino microcontroller.                      :
