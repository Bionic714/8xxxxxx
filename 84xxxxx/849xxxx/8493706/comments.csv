Why do you have to use a 4MB piece size?
Please make it smaller!"
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-05-20T19:18Z,@DaBorgQueen It's just the default setting for this size. I'll try to remember to change on the next.

Thanks also in advance for decreasing the piece size on next week's uploads!"

,glemi,2013-05-20T22:59Z,"hi thanks for providing this torrent. 
I have been wondering what does ""YFN"" at the end of the file name stand for? What's the difference between this one and the NTb one?"
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-05-21T01:59Z,"@glemi, YFN is the acronym for Your Friendly Neighbourhood, the release ""group"".

Basically it is the same file bought on iTunes, the difference in the size is because NTb removes the stereo track, keeping only the Dolby Digital 5.1."
