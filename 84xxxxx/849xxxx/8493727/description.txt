The Case Against Christianity by Michael Martin- pdf.

"It is a wonder that nobody has done a book like ┬╖this before as well as this book
is done. It is a thorough, logical examination of the major tenants of
Christianity by a professional philosopher (not a theologian). Martin brings his
cool, logical mind to each of the major doctrines of Christianity .... What
results is the best book for the intelligent reader that examines the case for and
against Christianity .... The book is must reading for all who discuss (or
defend) Christianity from a critical point of view." -American Rationalist

"Martin offers an insightful and provocative rational analysis of the major doctrinal claims of Christianity . .. . Because of its clarity and general scholarship, as well as the position it presents, this book belongs in all libraries with holdings in religious studies and philosophy of religion." - Choice

"His book is nothing less than astoundingly insightful and carefully reasoned.
Every page is strewn with gems worth examining with infinite patience .. . .
Every serious student of Christian doctrine would do well to spend time on
Martin's insightful chapters." - Free Inquiry

"This book is a joy to read. It brings together not only Martin's thoughts about
Christianity, but important views, pro and con, from important writers in the
field from Russell to Aquinas, Kaufmann to Augustine, Robertson to
Kierkegaard .... "- Peter A. Angeles, Santa Barbara City College

"Martin is one of the very few first-rate philosophers who have had the fortitude
and patience to carefully read much of the truly staggering amount of nonphilosophical literature on Christian topics."
