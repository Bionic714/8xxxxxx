WWE Jake The Snake Roberts - Pick Your Poison





Disc One

Documentary and insight to the life of Jake 'The Snake Roberts

Matches:

Vs. Ricky Steamboat - This was dubbed a "Snake Pit" match which was another name for a "no rules" bout! This happened on the
undercard of THE BIG EVENT and which probably would've been match of the night if not for the
Hulk Hogan/"Mr. Wonderful" Paul Orndorff showdown in the main event!

Vs. The Honky Tonk Man - This was at WrestleMania III and still stands as Roberts most memorable match only because it took
place in front of the record setting crowd of 93,173 in the Pontiac Silverdome! SIDENOTE: While this is Roberts' most
memorable, his best WrestleMania showdown was at number 6 when he took on Ted DiBiase for the "Million Dollar Belt."

Vs. "Ravishing" Rick Rude - This was the DDT Vs. The Rude Awakening match from MSG. The only stip was that the pinfall could
only come after one man applied his finisher! Made for great drama and strategy.
