cFosSpeed is a network driver, which attaches itself to existing Internet connections. It then optimizes data transfer by means of Traffic Shaping. Traffic Shaping is a method for optimizing the Internet traffic. It allows maximum speed while ensuring minimal Ping. You can use cFosSpeed with a router and/or a DSL-modem or cable-modem. You can also use cFosSpeed with other types of Internet access, ie. whenever you already have an existing Internet connection. cFosSpeed supports a wide variety of connections, like DSL, cable, ISDN, UMTS, etc. 

cFosSpeed 9.04 build 2051 -- 19-Apr-2013

* New skin in Metro style. Have fun! :-)
+ Tweaked behaviour of auto hide on fullscreen, so it respects manual window closing and auto-open/hide settings better.
+ After the status windows was closed 3 times, cFosSpeed will now ask you if you want to disable auto-open/auto-hide.
+ RWIN expansion now opens the window more eagerly.
+ Completely new russian translation.  Thanks to Armor Darks.
