There is a 1.73 GiB file of this episode..I think its this one..that sadly..has been ""Ego Stamped"" with encoder Graffiti..okay..not a Big Deal..but annoying to me..possibly to others..big bright Pink and Yellow ""Tagging"" over the credits etc..

Your decision..just a heads up..might want to go a little higher/lower gig and avoid the ego trippers."
