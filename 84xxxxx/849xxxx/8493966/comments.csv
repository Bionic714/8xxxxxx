Im with you on that.... Must be to complicated for everyone else."
,BitBro,2013-05-21T21:24Z,"I gave it a try and it needs some improvement, like when checking a big torrent youre trying to seed.It took longer than utorrent and kept getting file access errors when utorrent never got any.

When loading torrents that save to the same folder it instead creates a folder named (1)FolderName instead of just using the same folder as the other torrent.

I liked the client but it doesnt suit my needs."
,js99912,2013-05-22T08:18Z,"this is great.  it seems you have deliberately made easy, the stupid shit that utorrent either leaves out or a pain to setup.  I had no issues caching while seeding or checking even after I hit it with a massive xfiles torrent.

the only nit-picky thing, a real dark theme would be the ballz, i like the black bg, much better than ut which blinds you.

I'll help seed it! thank you
