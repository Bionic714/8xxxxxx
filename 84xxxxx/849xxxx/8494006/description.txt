1975 World Series Interviews between the Boston Red Sox and 

the Cincinnati Reds. These are the interviews between the retired players 

about the game on both sides. It is neat to see what they look like today.

Ripped from the DVD's that were recorded in VHS quality and aged over time.

Well worth download if you are into classic baseball games. This compliments

the 1975 World Series I uploaded a few weeks ago. I hope you like it. You won't

find it anywhere else...
