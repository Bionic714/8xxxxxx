"It took all of human history until the year 1804 for our population to reach its first billion. Now a billion new people are added every dozen years. In the industrialized world--Japan, Europe, and the United States--birthrates are falling steeply while the senior citizen population is booming. In this two-hour Earth Day special, NOVA explores these and other trends in the relationship between people and the planet."

Notes:

- Wikipedia calls this episode S31E08 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)

- The aspect ratio and resolution of the original DVD source were non-standard/letterboxed. I cropped out most of the letterboxing. The black bar at the bottom isn't erroneous; it is due to the program's overlays extending into the letterboxing so enough was left that they were not lost. The end credits' letters are slightly clipped at the top as the image goes to 4:3 fullscreen then.

- Please seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent stays alive. My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.
If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
