,Killher,2013-05-21T18:29Z,@chafar that's what you're SUPPOSED to do you dirty fucking leech. Why would you complain about helping the community. You literally bitch that people aren't seeding because you don't want to seed. Go play in traffic you cockwallet. My bad. Your dirty ass country barely has internet. Much less traffic.

,wheresalltheseedersgone,2013-05-23T06:26Z,"@Juggs99 - cheers for the up! Great copy!

To the people saying ""seed"" if you fucking seeded then people like us (appreciative of the free movies and happy to repay the favor by sharing) wouldn't have to seed to cover for all the people who don't just to keep a good file that someone has put hard work into circulating for free. Don't bitch and moan, just download the movie and seed and be sure to say thanks to the uploader who actually made it possible for you to have the movie. Peace"

,Aussiestyle1975,2013-05-25T16:50Z,For fuck sake u wingers about the fucking 2 part files the reason why is that cock sucking assholes at Cina-avia your playstation and xboxers  are fucked for playing the movies while they are still at the cinemas !!!!!! the sound files are uploaded to a website and downloaded to your system updates its fucked . the only way around it is 2 part files vcd not avi or mp4 and shit like that . if ya cluey about it you can downgrade your system version but u cantplay ya games online so ya screwed there i gave up on the shit and bought a media centre player for $60 aud and network the fucker to play the filesover the network hehe fuckem

,eldon907,2013-05-27T21:39Z,Thank you I will never understand the babies that cry over anything and everything. Give the a lollypop and they will cry because the stick's paper is twisted to the right instead of to the left. Guess if they were on fire and you put out the fire with bottled water instead of tap water they would find something to bitch about with the brand of the bottled water. WAHHHH WAHHH
,funseeker521,2013-05-31T06:03Z,"Please seed I don't have all hour! WTF it's in 2 files! My girlfriend told me this movie sucks so I'm repeating that to insure I don't get cut off (sexually). Where are the subs? This is a fake DL. Every month my pussy hurts. My Player doesnt know how to play this type of file.

,Gargamel77,2013-05-31T23:15Z,"This was a nice action movie. However, the whole war on drugs on which this movie is premised is a joke. I highly recommend watching the doc The House I Live In which exposes the war on drugs for what it really is. Here's the link:

First- consider the source. It's a movie with Dwayne Johnson. Set your standards from that point as to what you should expect. It's a totally watchable, weeknight dinner flick.  Not great, not horrible, extremely predictable.  There are definitely much worse movies out there you could watch.  "
,Rotty_Weiller,2013-06-10T18:40Z,Just drag both files into a playlist and they will switch seamlessly....STOP WHINING AND CRYING!!!!
