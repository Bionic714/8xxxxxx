Battlescars: A Rock & Roll Romance (Battlescars #1) by Sophie Monroe (March 12th 2013)

Aubrey Thompson is a twenty-three year old flight attendant for her dadâ™s small commercial fleet. Sheâ™s a sarcastic smartass that has no problem telling you where to go. She also despises rock stars…but thatâ™s all part of the story. Her Granny Jean is spy and will have you laughing out loud.

In comes Jake Parker, the twenty-five year old lead singer of Battlescars. His reputation is the untamable bad-boy. Heâ™s completely “balls to the wall” in everything that he does. Two days after returning home from a month long tour across Europe he gets a visit from Bruce, an executive from the record label. He informs Jake that Battlescars is going back on tour for three months. What everyone doesnâ™t know is that Jake is worn down and sick of the same old shit.

His record label hires Aubreyâ™s dads company to fly him around for the last minute tour. In order to keep her dad's company afloat they will have to learn to play nice. When Jake first meets Aubrey she refuses to even acknowledge his existence. He sees her as refreshing and a challenge.

Both of them have some pretty heavy scars from their pasts holding them back. Can Jake get Aubrey to let him in? Or will she shoot him down based on his outlandish reputation? Will her fear of getting hurt again keep him out for good?

Are the two of them a match in heaven or hell?
