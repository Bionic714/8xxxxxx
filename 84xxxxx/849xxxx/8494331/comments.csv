,montorpelieou,2013-05-25T15:13Z,"Its working, MSSE isnt complaining about the program.

BUT the .exe should not be password protected (when you open the .exe as an archive) to allow the user to not use the ""menu like"" interface and extract the files where he wants (also preventing malware execution).

Seriously what is the need to put a f*ckin password for manually extracting files ..."
