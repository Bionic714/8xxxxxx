This one is 1080. 280 pixels just happen to be black bars. Don't blame the uploader. Blame the movie director. "

,kiwij,2013-05-25T12:46Z,@ps7825 - show me a 1080P display that can display more than 1920 horizontal pixels???
,dvdgeek,2013-05-26T05:38Z,"1080p is 1920x1080 (1920-Vertical X 1080-Horizonal Lines) Black bars are there because the actual aspect in which the movie was filmed is not exactly the same ratio, the original is scaled to fit within the 1920 Vertical scans and preserving the ratio, the black bars are added. Please understand all this before posting comments."
