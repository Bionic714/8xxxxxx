The BLOODLINES Summer Annual crossover continues from Action Comics Annual #5. In an attempt to retrieve Timber Wolf from the 20th century, Brainiac unwittingly brings the parasite Angon and his victim - a young surfer dude named Jamm - into the 30th century. They rid themselves of the parasite, but the greater monster has been left behind in the form of Jamm, who Angon has imbued with the power of suggestion. Now, anything Jamm wants, Jamm gets...including having Valor, Tasmia Mallor and Lydda Krin as his personal tour guides of the 30th century, and Legionnaires Andromeda and Apparition as part of his "band." The BLOODLINES saga continues in Green Arrow Annual #6.
