Impossible. All works fine."
,arditjaha,2013-06-01T15:20Z,First I got css v1718178 which was working pretty fine . Then I joined a server and it said that the gaming is running in a differet version so I started css updater and updated files than I started the game but it was not oppening . It does not load at all . So I downloaded this version right now and istalled still the same proble. If i try to install v1718178 it works just fine but when i update or install this the game won't open and I never haded this problem
,arditjaha,2013-06-01T19:41Z,Never mind . I just tested now and it works like a charm
