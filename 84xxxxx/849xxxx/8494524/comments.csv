2 - Open ableton_live_suite_9.0.1_64.dmg and drag it onto your applications
3 - Open LivePatch.[io].dmg
4 - Go to your Applications folder, find ""Ableton Live 9 Suite"", drag and drop the application onto the LivePatch window
5 - Go back to your desktop and open ""Authorize.auz""
6 - NOW you can open Ableton and it is now authorized"

Thanks Future-Dada, you guys are amazing."
,wallpaprr,2013-05-31T06:03Z,Any chance of upping the 32bit version? Most VSTs are unusable without buying additional software to bridge.
