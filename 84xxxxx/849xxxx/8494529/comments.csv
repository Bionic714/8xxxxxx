The uploader downloads a program, prepares a torrent and uploads it, waiting patiently to share it with others using his own Bandwidth and time ( = Money and care of sharing), instead of Thanking the uploader for his / her efforts you have the idiocy of posting stupid comments."
,UltraCat,2013-05-21T21:03Z,"Uploader : You may do a big effort sharing these files, but they are FREEWARE and so easy to find.  What if you do the same effort but UPLOADING hard-2-find files? .... The net is full of sites to download freeware (safe sites with higher bandwidth), so you are not helping the community as you think."
[T],prodallasosoft,2013-05-21T21:59Z,"so when and where did you last find Java 8,"
[T],allal123,2013-05-21T23:56Z,"@ promodsharma & prodallasosoft
do not give importance to unnecessary comments !
the dogs bark but the caravan moves !

thx for all your hard work ."
,UltraCat,2013-05-22T03:47Z,"Well , when & where is not a problem since in the next 24 hours 10.000 users will find it for US.  I do the same question to you, but replace ""java""  for  a hard-2-find app... + crack... and all with make sense.

For now, avoid re-re-re-share  java, ccleaner, winrar... etc."
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-22T06:56Z,"@ 'seppmoser55' and ' UltraCat' - So you want ""Hard to Find Programs"" and there are 10,000 users out there who can find it out there  Well, when did you last share even a simple free program with others ? or are you just suckers ?"
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-22T23:54Z,"@'seppmoser55' - You are a just comment spammer and I like comment spammers, because they entertain and amuse the TPB community like roadside clowns ""...muahahahahaha "" !

Now, if you haven't noticed all softwares (free and licensed) have an auto update which in some cases can be turned on/off by the user. 

The seeder / Leecher number increases / decreases as per the downloaders in different timezones.

You can definitely assume that there are TPB members who have downloaded this software (Total 150 in all as of now) are in need of it inspite of it being 'Free'. 

Now I eagerly await your next comment. Please scream on. I am enjoying it."
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-23T05:40Z,"@ 'seppmoser55' - I observe that you have also started comment spamming my pages also @

Note : I am awaiting your next comment with great anticipation. "
,UltraCat,2013-05-23T16:27Z,Sharing FREEWARE only feeds leeches and lazy guys. Bandwidth & Hosting-Service is an expensive pain and using that precious resourses for freeware is a sin.
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-23T20:26Z,"@'UltraCat' - Sharing freeware is valid on TPB. It brings to focus numerous useful freeware to new members who were not aware of such softwares. As a matter of fact there are numerous portals on WWW that host third party Free Software, Updates etc. Why not TPB ? Your logic is not valid."
,UltraCat,2013-05-25T00:50Z,"You have said it for me... ""there are more sites in the WWW for freeware sharing"" ... So my POV is valid at 100%.

I never said ""freeware sharing is forbbiden here"" , I have said ""It is a sin to waste bandwidth & hosting costs with freeware that you can download somewhere else"" . Sharing freeware in a torrent's place is like posting SPAM in your email... heheh."
[V],promodsharma,2013-05-25T06:10Z,"@'... heheh' (aka UltraCat) By your logic, TPB should only upload Cracks / Patches / Keygens / serials as the exe of most of the softwares are available for free download as trials. So it's a sin to upload entire softwares the bulk of which is available for free download ?"
