PLEASE SUPPORT THESE AMAZING ARTISTS!
I am a hardcore Lindsey Stirling fan "Stirlingite" and really want her to be supported. It is time consuming putting something like this together. I just want to save you time. So, please purchase her songs on iTunes and/or get the CD.

KSLL!

All the tracks that were available on iTunes were purchased then converted to 320kbps mp3.
The others are from other torrents on The Pirate Bay or downloaded off of YouTube. (YouTube is 192kbps)
Lindsey Stirling is under contributing artist on all songs in the tags, excluding Stomp on Melvin and the Christmas songs, so it is easier to play on devices. The tracks are in folders based on who else is on the track.
If there are any problems or questions let me know.
