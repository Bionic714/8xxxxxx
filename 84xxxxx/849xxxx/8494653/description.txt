NOTES
Source had a lot of camera movement. Was able to improve it but there is
still some movement a couple times here and there. The video quality itself
was good for a cam and audio is decent too. And now this has the post
credit scene at end included in one avi file for those that want it :)

Sample included. Enjoy!
