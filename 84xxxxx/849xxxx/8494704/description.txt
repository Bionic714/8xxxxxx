The first upload with my TPB green skull! I'm honored, though I just can't upload much at all now. (But no captcha to enter... wooohooo!)

This new issue of the new Superman digital comic is a great way to share my never-ending enjoyment of great comics. If you aren't reading Adventures of Superman, give it a try. So far, every issue has had a self-contained story starring the classic, red-trunks Supes. And DeMatteis & Buscema (although he's inking Camuncoli) are a flashback to a great run on Spectacular Spider-Man!
