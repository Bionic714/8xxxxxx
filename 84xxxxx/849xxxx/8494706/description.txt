
Do you have 10-15 minutes to kill? Alpha Wave was made for just such an occasion! A nicely crafted, high-speed, intense arcade space shooter with it's roots firmly planted in the old-school arcade classics such as AstroSmash, Galaga and Asteroids.

Plenty of non-stop, progressive action with a variety of different enemies each with their own unique behaviors along with final bosses to bring it all to an intense finish. Coupled with amazing special effects and original musical score, Alpha Wave delivers the best quality for the lowest price we could set.

Xperia Play optimized! If you are fortunate enough to own one of these fine devices then you will be happy to know Alpha Wave is fully intractable with just the gamepad and buttons!

Alpha Wave is now MOGA Enhanced! Available at major retailers, carrier stores and online at http://www.MOGAanywhere.com
