The Lone Ranger and Tonto ride once again in this classic western tale set against the cruel backdrop of winter on the badlands of North Texas. Acting alone, the Ranger takes it upon himself to stand in the way of Kiowa war parties who have broken from their reservation in Oklahoma. If the renegades make it far enough into Texas and meet up with their Comanche brothers then the entire Lone Star State will become a battlefield. The masked rider of the plains and Silver follow the stories of a mythical spirit horse, an animal of legend that's been sighted by the tribes and incited them to ride the warpath. The Ranger believes that this spirit horse is real and is determined to find it to bring peace to the land once again.
