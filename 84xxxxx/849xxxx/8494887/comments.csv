,markall44,2013-05-21T08:42Z,No seeders connecting...
,majo0007,2013-05-21T10:58Z,AYFucking Kidding Me!!! Whats with the Subtitles - from another movie!!! - another mistake from crap group!!!
,Adam_OSFP,2013-05-21T12:27Z,"@majo0007

It's NOT a mistake. They used to state in the description there are subtitles, but there was no file. After a while people start checking for subtitles file before downloading, so now they put a fake file with subtitles from another movie. So lame."
,CrysisHawk,2013-05-21T13:55Z,Thanks :) so much
,ashura889,2013-05-21T14:12Z,yify what program do you use to compres the videos
,alveolate,2013-05-21T14:34Z,so can a good guy post a link to some actual subs then? my subs sites almost always screw me over :(
,chicagotarsier,2013-05-21T16:21Z,"Thank you for the movie.  Thank you for the effort.  Thank you for allowing me to live a better life without having to pay 20 USD for a blueray disk....each.

Watched 2000 of your movies so far. That is 40K usd saved.

Thank you again."
,Vingogh,2013-05-21T17:27Z,Great Torrent as usual
,brakkoli,2013-05-21T18:05Z,god this torrent is moving slow.. like an old grandma
,ArGyTV,2013-05-21T18:37Z,Yify use the handbrake to make small size movies
,Amafule10,2013-05-21T20:11Z,ΕΧΩ 3 ΑΡΧΙΔΙΑ !!
,hdbrazzer,2013-05-21T20:30Z,subtitles are not proper
,flipendo,2013-05-21T20:43Z,sort out the subtitles you piece of shit
,djaooo,2013-05-22T05:07Z,"lol @ faggots complaining about subtitles. Be grateful, YIFY are amazing"
,obvious2me,2013-05-22T09:03Z,"Feel free to leave out subtitles in future movies... I don't give a shit; If I wanted them as badly as the few angry people that have spoken out I would simply go get them elsewhere.

Thanks for another great torrent, and remember for every 1 hater there are thousands of people who thoroughly enjoy what you do."
,Bachathon,2013-05-22T20:22Z,"YIFY!!! My God, my Lord. I have just created an account so that I could thank you for your wonderful torrents. But I have a SERIOUS request. Please, please, please, please expand your fan base by uploading blu-ray Operas!! They can't be found anywhere (I mean, anywhere!) on Torrentz. And they are hideously expensive to buy. May be, you can begin with some Mozart/Verdi staples such as Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, La Traviata. If you have read this comment, please do reply to it and explain if you can upload blu-ray operas. It may be wishful thinking on my part. But, anyway, thanks ever so much for your amazing torrents.

This is amazing. This copy looks and sounds like a blu-ray, and it's ONLY 818mb!! TERRIFIC JOB ON THIS ONE, YIFY! Thank you yet again :)"
,akapr40,2013-05-23T01:51Z,yify ur the best thanks
,firexninja,2013-05-23T04:59Z,thank you!
,tpboss,2013-05-23T05:05Z,"Yea, as stated before the subs are really off but if you need them it only takes a second to find another one. Kinda weak though, YIFY torrents usually come with the right subs, idk why this one didn't. But lol jeez, relax haters it's not that big of a deal. Why is it that YIFY's torrents are all over the top 100 torrents and there's always tons of seeders? Cus his are always the best. "
,Makb1,2013-05-23T05:52Z,"@tpboss Yes, YIFY's subs are usually good but these same ones that are for a different movie are what you find in any search - some can't watch a movie without subs. But you are right, hating is a poor show and YIFY probably just picked what was available without checking.

A quick look says there are over 25,000 DL's of the bad subs so it's no wonder some are pissed off.

The latest best is to be found here : http://subscene.com/subtitles/snitch-2013/english/734834 

They need work but are better than nothing for poor hearing or poor sound reproduction."

,deku333,2013-06-01T18:39Z,22 minutes in: at least the rock is trying to show real emotions. counts for me! ;)
,pissandfeces,2013-06-06T01:10Z,Thanks YIFY!
,sirbow2,2013-06-06T16:00Z,"fleshknight, that is technically impossible. a properly made release that is twice the size = twice the bitrate and therefor should be better."
