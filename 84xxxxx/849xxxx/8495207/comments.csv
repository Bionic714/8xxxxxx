,BluntzNzigzags,2013-05-21T07:58Z,thank you hero master. Been looking forward to this. Downloading now and will seed when done. 
,googleLT,2013-05-21T08:04Z,"thanks HeroMaster , you are da best!!!"
,blazebuny,2013-05-21T10:10Z,didnt work and it found virus/. it makes the screen go black for a second and then nothing
,thedeadpool1,2013-05-21T10:58Z,I get the same thing as blazebuny. Tried Compatibility Mode with Win7 and that didn't work. 
,anab0lix,2013-05-21T13:14Z,"It works for me and game play is smooth.

Windows 7 64bit
Intel core i7 2.2ghz
4gb ram
geforce gt 540m

However, game is not able to save.  Every time the auto save tries to save it says it fails during game play...

I'm going to try to play around but if anyone knows why let me know please.

Thanks"
,anab0lix,2013-05-21T14:37Z,"Tried pretty much everything and still a no go for the game save problem.

Downloading other rips as we speak.  Hope they work."

,runwhen_useeme,2013-05-21T17:49Z,"Doesn't save. 

Don't download this version. "
,onsecrethunt,2013-05-21T20:06Z,Thanks for this awesome Game :) http://www.onsecrethunt.com/
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-05-21T21:01Z,it seems the voice files are messed up in this version...sometimes people talk and sometimes it cuts off right as there speaking...very annoying.
,kennedy3x,2013-05-21T21:15Z,"I don't know what you guys are talking about. I followed the instructions and I'm saving with no problem. 
btw, I changed the installation directory to a new one, and then copied the files from the nodvd folder in it. "
,maernoud,2013-05-21T22:50Z,Black screen and close itself rightaway... doesn't work... any solution so far? 
,anab0lix,2013-05-21T23:44Z,"Heromaster's upload of the FLT rip works better than this version.

That one does not have game save problems and is an easier installation with mounting program.

Download other rips and don't waste time with this one.

Good luck"
,jdc2389,2013-05-22T03:15Z,"This Torrent works FINE, I scanned it with malware-bytes latest updated database 0 malicious files detected. The game is saving fine. Misinformation/bullshit lies and flat out stupidity going on here. This torrent is all good and I downloaded it at 5megs per second once it really got going my upload speed was at 450kbps. Thanks HM!"
,jdc2389,2013-05-22T03:18Z,"Oh I'm running on Win 8 64-bit, and heres a tip. Infernal mode is retarded don't try it."
,anab0lix,2013-05-22T05:33Z,"Must work fine on windows 8.  There's obviously some compatibility problem or some other issue if more than one person is getting save issues.  NOT what I would call misinformation or bullshit.   This was like the first release on TPB alone and now there are over 10 better ones you can choose from..mmmk?

,Ayetu,2013-05-22T15:24Z,"For anyone Having problems with black screen or save issues, try to download FLT Crack.

Thanks for the upload works great :)"
,luanbra,2013-05-25T13:24Z,this game can be played in the Portuguese Brazil?
