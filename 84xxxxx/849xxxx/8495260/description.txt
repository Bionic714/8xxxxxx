Raw and rocking collaboration between Jack Rose and the Black Twigs with some of the most swinging, hard-hitting string music waxed in many a decade. RoseΓÇÖs solo playing has always had a tough edge, with his prodigious technique often employed in the service of dropping right-hand bombs ΓÇô his use of a thumbpick originates from his years of duets with Twig Mike Gangloff, struggling to make his guitar heard over GangloffΓÇÖs crashing banjo. The front line of Rose and GangloffΓÇÖs strings are joined by Isak HowellΓÇÖs no-nonsense guitar and harmonica and Nate BowlesΓÇÖ variety of expert percussion. The four players lock together with a sure-footedness honed by frequent touring and a singularity of intent to rock. Gangloff takes the vocals, howling out standards like ΓÇ£Little SadieΓÇ¥ firmly in the old-time tradition ΓÇô without reserve. A few of the tracks here are updates of Rose & family classics, with the group turning the stately ΓÇ£Kensington BluesΓÇ¥ upbeat and an issuing an assured take on ΓÇ£Bright Sunny South,ΓÇ¥ first recorded by Pelt (w/Rose and Gangloff) back in 2001 on their gonzo classic double ΓÇ£Ayahuasca.ΓÇ¥
