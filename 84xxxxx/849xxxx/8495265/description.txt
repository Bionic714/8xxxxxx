Collection D'Arnell-Andréa is a French darkwave band founded by Jean-Christophe d'Arnell (main composer, writer, piano/keyboards), Pascal Andréa, and Chloé St Liphard in 1986. Andréa left the band shortly after its founding, before its first performance. However, d'Arnell left Andréa's name in the band name. Their music features proeminently keyboards, cello, and Chloé's vocals. The band is known for including a large collection or ensemble of musicians in its live performances and has performed at numerous international music festivals including Germany's Wave-Gotik-Treffen. Many of their albums have focused on late 19th and early 20th century themes.

When the band signed with Prikosnovénie in 2002, the label re-edited and re-released many of the previous New Rose Records albums that had previously been out of print. Signing with Prikosnovénie also resulted in three new albums and a new tour schedule through Europe.
