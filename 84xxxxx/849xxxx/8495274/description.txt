Filling itlivz request to make a tutorial vid on how to crack Project Zomboid.

cracking project zomboid, in this case was rather simple, so the tutorial is mainly on creating SFX archives with WinRAR, and how I made the pre-cracked installer for release.

If you don't want to watch all 30 minutes here are some important times in the video:

start to 3:22 - Explains cracking of Project Zomboid.
3:22 to 7:13 - Shows you how to create your own crack.exe.
7:13 to 9:39 - Shows you how to create a SFX archive like the previous release.
9:39 to end - Advanced SFX and compression options.
