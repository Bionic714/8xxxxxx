,tdunkc,2013-05-26T04:31Z,"Those trying to get an activated copy of Office 2010 and or 2013 just download  Windows.7.Loader.eXtreme.Edition.v3.503-NAPALUM - This loader will activate any version of windows 7/server 2008/ and MS Office.  Also, just a heads up, your virus protection might detect it, but it is a false positive.  There are a couple you can download, but not through me.  Let me know if you want to DL it from me and i'll upload."
