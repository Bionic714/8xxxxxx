[V],murphy78,2013-05-21T10:23Z,"Yes, this is win7 with updates... If you want a win7 without updates, go download the digital river iso."
[H],Devastat0r36,2013-05-21T10:29Z,Hi murphy78 just wanna say im a big fan of your work ! Do you think you could ever make an up to date Windows 8/Sever 2012 Super AIO ?
,nj98110,2013-05-21T10:36Z,Can we use this on UEFI boot systems?
[V],murphy78,2013-05-21T12:03Z,"I didn't use a special boot sector for UEFI, but I haven't tested it on dvd mode, so I don't know on that one.

If you use USB, then yes, it should work for UEFI."
[V],murphy78,2013-05-21T12:09Z,"Thx for the compliment dev. I'm not sure... I guess it depends how much ppl seed... I can't integrate while seeding because it causes hard disk read/write errors rarely while running a torrent program. It also depends on whether or not the indexes are compatible with win8's sources files like win7 is. I couldn't get vista to work using win8's files, and trying to install them from vista's boot.wim is just backward. It would cause more problems than it would solve...

I'll think about it if I have time...
I still gotta crank out the 4 office versions, 2 updated win8+office2013 versions, and I'd like to get some non-office syspreps done since it's been like 3 months..."
[H],Devastat0r36,2013-05-21T12:48Z,Ah Okay I see man but thanx for the reply i appreciate it.But i think you would get right im gonna give it a try as soon as my studies are done and i have more time. But keep up the grate work :). I was also thinking an up to date standalone Sever 2012 would also be grate....
,slav2012,2013-05-21T13:45Z,thx... very
,ahmedmahdy20,2013-05-21T14:50Z,"Murphy if possible make Windows 7 ultimate 32 with updates and Internet Explorer10 only without adding the net frame work and USB3, and Network DriversAnd also the same version for the 64-bit versionAnd Murphy not add this update 971033 thank you Murphy"
,ahmedmahdy20,2013-05-21T17:19Z,"Thanks Murphy for the reply
can you show me the way and the progam to add ubdates to win7 image"
[V],murphy78,2013-05-22T00:11Z,"ahmed, that's a 2hr conversation... You could start with rt7lite and look thru MDL forum about integrating IE10 and the pre-requisites...
It's really rather involved to explain everything..."
,cacce,2013-05-23T07:30Z,"Thank you for this Murphy78.
Been trying for a while to find a compatible version for bootcamp and my Imac, this one worked.
Was a bit tweaking and working around, but thats all bootcamps faults.
In the end it works perfectly."
[V],murphy78,2013-05-23T16:48Z,I'd be interested to find out if you tried the digital river retail download isos cacce or if there was some sort of usb driver you needed that I've included. I say that because I don't really do anything that would enable it to run on one machine over another. Theoretically this should work on any machine that could install the digital river retail isos.
,fulronge,2013-05-24T00:09Z,"Thanks for this massive upload murphy, quick question though im downloading this on my macbook pro to make a bootable usb.. in uTorrent the iso file says clearly it's 3.8 gig but once downloaded on my mac the iso file size became 4.17 gigs.. and i cant put it on my 4gb flash drive.. any clues ?"
,LOQUILLO_,2013-05-24T06:06Z,"Thanks mate.
All is OK."
,LOQUILLO_,2013-05-24T06:07Z,"Thanks mate, all is working OK."
,saulius31,2013-05-24T10:09Z,"Hi murphy78,

great share, but I'm not sure if this copy of Windows is really activated. Under Pystem Properties I still get a message ""2 days until activation. Activate Windows now"" and the number of days of days is going down... If I click on that, it just says that activationkey is invalid. Am I missing something? "
,mibmib007,2013-05-24T11:30Z,is it just use this and copy iso content to usb and install as usually? my 7 enterprise got out of date =( so will try this one if its the same install options.. and is activator included auto?
,manzy3000,2013-05-24T20:42Z,"Thank you buddy. your works is awesome in every way...installed, activated and running like a charm. :)"
,rehansiddiq,2013-05-25T11:30Z,"thanks dear   ;)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,Dante9898,2013-05-26T00:16Z,"Hey murphy, just discovered your torrents today, was kinda curious to know if you have a blog or something where you explain a little about these isos (What do they include, how to install, etc)

Also what do you mean when you say ""No Programs are added to Windows""?"
,Dooshbag,2013-05-26T05:07Z,Works perfectly!  Easy install.  Been flawless for over two months now.  Thanks a million
,cacce,2013-05-28T23:23Z,"Hey Murph 
I have used this for a week no problem, but today I got ""you must activate windows within 24 days to use all of bla.bla.bla.bla""
Any tips ? 
I hope I dont have to re-install .. was a hoot thru bootcamp the first time around ;)

Any update that might have caused this im not aware of or something they released the past days ?
Thx
Cacce"
[V],murphy78,2013-05-30T05:03Z,"cacce, windows loader is probably not compatible with bootcamp...

You might try using a kms-activated index from my AIO I'm about to release..."
,badikdik,2013-06-01T15:33Z,"can i use this for a current version of ultimate to upgrade?
i want to thumbs up for murphy works..."
,mahes3426,2013-06-02T08:36Z,thanks man
,Soynagera,2013-06-02T10:38Z,"Does this version comes with boot? I got fresh new pc , and i got asus P8Z77-m motherboard , so i only win7 and win8 would work with my ram (8gb)"
,dr.potato,2013-06-02T23:55Z,"So, if I burn this to a disc I can use this as a regular boot install disc? I saw the comment about uefi... any further word on this?"
,dist2,2013-06-04T09:52Z,"Hello,
Installed perfctly and runs great BUT, as Cacce, i'm asked to activate.... bummer...

You talked bout a kms-activated index in your reply but where could it be found ? it's a separate release ?
tx in advance"
,Gabarito,2013-06-05T23:09Z,"This file has no .iso to burn on a DVD. And if I try to burn them directly, the software doesn't accept some files."
,Gabarito,2013-06-05T23:48Z,"sorry, nevermind. RAR tricked me!
All working. Thanks!"
,AirheadOz,2013-06-08T18:39Z,"After installing this as a fresh install, Windows may say that this copy is not genuine and that you should ask for a refund. However, after setup is fully completed, you won't see a message informing you that this version of Windows isn't genuine and in ""System"" Windows will be fully activated. Success!

P.S. As a precaution, I would probably disable Windows Update. Who needs it anyway?"
,Ronade,2013-06-09T14:19Z,"Hey murphy!

Can you give a short info how to install it? Normal boot iso on dvd and go in? I can on windows update or disable it? Its activaded and only i need to install it ?
Thx for info!"
,cojon,2013-06-10T22:54Z,"Wow, excellent writeup. Complete and useful. Fast DL, great install, one small problem--my bad-- and fixed. I sincerely thank you for your excellent offering and all the intelligent work you provided. 

Murph, you is absolutely da MAN! "
,SirScoops,2013-06-11T00:23Z,"Hilarious that so many of these torrents boast ""IE10"" as if anyone gave a flying fuck.... I'd love it if IE was removed!"
,SirScoops,2013-06-11T00:24Z,"oh, not to sound like a douche... bro im gonna be running the shit out of this for a while... might even name my computer murphy"
,TheAslan,2013-06-12T21:32Z,When June release is coming?
