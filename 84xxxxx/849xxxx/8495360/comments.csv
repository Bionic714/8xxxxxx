,johnny614,2013-05-21T23:41Z,"How do I fix this?!? When I try to run the game, it opens Steam and tells me I should buy it :("
,Dunge,2013-05-22T00:11Z,"cagunosu : This is ported from DS, I doubt requirement are relevant for anyone.

p9o1p : This is not the place to ask.

johnny614 : Copy the crack?"
,majuaraan,2013-05-22T04:33Z,"@ Dunge the game was not 'ported' to PC it was completely remade if you think just cuz it was for the ds originally means that it runs on a computer with as low end cpu/gpu as a ds, that's just insane"
,cagunosu,2013-05-22T07:49Z,"@majuaraan +1 , exactly what i was going to say.."

,chrispi777,2013-05-24T17:32Z,would like to know if this includes DLC?
,StealthDragoon,2013-05-24T23:20Z,"Don't follow SeedboxMirror's link, it's full of fail and aids."
,WonderPirate24,2013-05-25T09:14Z,"Hey! Does anybody knows, the location where
Resident Evil Revelations stored the save games,
I need to back them up right away, corrupted OS is failing fast! OS failure is imminent! Had No luck finding answers to this question on the web, hope someone can help. Thanks  advance."
,WonderPirate24,2013-05-25T09:57Z,"I doubt if this release includes the DLC your looking for, Assuming your looking for the three special weapons DLC pack, release in Japan, with the special guns like the Samurai Edge Jill Model,
Government Parker Model, and G18 Jessica Model. The only release that fit this description might be the ""Resident Evil Revelations PC full game + DLC ^^nosTEAM^^."""
