[V],psspss,2013-05-21T15:25Z,"web ripped opps.. and thnx

they have some other interesting docus from UFOs and Paranormal on their tv web channel from the promos"
,leander3932,2013-05-21T18:01Z,thank you soo much. love you. xoxo
[T],trialNerror,2013-05-22T01:39Z,"1. You're welcome
2. No need to download a downgraded version of the promos.
Just watch them on AGHtelevision.com or on YouTube.
3. Maybe in the coming months we'll get Sky Wide Lies and A Blood Red Sky. Maybe.
4. Shame on you for pirating this and not supporting independent film making."
[T],trialNerror,2013-05-22T02:15Z,"5. Last but definitely not least... That guy pisspan can't even say thanks. Instead he tries to promote his own poorly made videos anyone can find on the original AGH website or youtube. Hah. Bloody hell, truly classic, man. :D

Personally I wouldn't follow a user like that. Their character is clearly of no respect, egotistical, down-talking those who actually release the original copies, and don't forget to mention unknowledgeable when it comes to video conversions. Why people follow someone like that is beyond me. *shrugs*"
,Gingasnapz,2013-05-22T15:31Z,"ty so much , i have been waiting for this to come out and all the documentaries filmmaker Chad Calek has released the past year. Are you going to be able to get the others. ty or this download , ur the best. :)"
[V],psspss,2013-05-22T16:05Z,"tne always talking the dirt.. cant even read thanx in above LOL 
whats it with you man..


if people choose not to following then they miss out big time of stuff no other ripper does

scene wont do web rips for starters

and iv ebeen doing parnormal stuff since 2005

lots of people follow me.. read the comments at tpb cant tell you that"
[V],psspss,2013-05-22T16:07Z,"the compilation I did 2 years of the promos and other back stories is better then the fragmented
clips on youtube as well

dont listen to tne.. he once wa s xvid lover now just spits everywhere"
[T],trialNerror,2013-05-22T22:54Z,"thx is the lazy ass not really thankful version. Pss, even with that choppy English, should be giving a real THANK YOU. And not to me, but to GoW. Also to all those whose sources he uses that if not for them he wouldn't have jack. Even the scene he despises so much. FYI, scene does do WEB-DL's if the video is of the groups interest. Scene does not do WEBRiP's because scene is about quality. Something you seem to not give 2 shites about or have no clue what it is.

Okay, so this guy has been converting online stuff to XviD for 8 years and still does it wrong? Heh! Damn, man. So is it you really don't know what quality is? Or just don't give a shite about it? I can't tell. A little of both?

People don't miss out on big time stuff if they don't follow you. Sounds like that ego of yours flaring up again. You should put some cream on that to settle it down. Majority of your releases are duplicates. Is C2CAM radio talk shows and misidentified UFO clips from openminds.tv a must have? Nope. Are the conspiracy clips about how the world is out to get you a must have? Nope. Besides, smart people watch and listen from their respective sites or download the original source, not from some over-sized poorly made re-encode. I must admit it was hilarious to see you release a 1GB slide show at 1000kbs CBR. Only the most foolish of fools do that, but it is satisfying to know you waste so much bandwidth with your monthly limit.

Comments?  ..of other users? ..on your torrents? Hmmm. Those are extremely hard to find in the massive piles of your own. That's no joke or exaggeration, either. Everyone in torrents can attest to that. Those who thank you for an XviD released a week after the original x264 was released don't count. Anybody that waits that long for a degraded version I truly feel sorry for.

I'm a once XviD lover? Maybe you're not aware of it, but a few years ago XviD was the best for compression to quality ratio at the time. That's history. x264 blows XviD out of the water and has so much device support now. This ""xvid for old gear"" excuse is getting too old. Let it go. Don't be afraid of the future. You'll save tons of data. Wait. Why am I trying to lend you advice? Psh. Hell with it. Stick to that outdated format, continue with your silly CBR, proceed to put that nonsense note about optimized headers because of whatever junkware you use to convert doesn't mux well so you have to use AVI-Mux GUI to mux again, and by all means feel free to repeatedly go over your limit every 3 weeks.

I just have to say that I am not bashing an individuals character. My opinion is based on a long-term observation and is clearly visible by many others. If I am an asshole, I'll admit it. If I'm wrong, I'll learn from it. One thing I am not is a dumbass dillhole in denial like some people seem to be. lol as entertaining as you are, please do Legend and I a favor and keep all further comments to yourself. Don't even mention either of us in one of your own torrent comments. This is probably asking far too much of you, though. Oh well.

Now with that all out of the way I Hate to be a spoiler, but aside from Ryan Buell and his paranormal professionalism this docu kinda sucked. I highly doubt the other docus of Chad's are going to be leaked any time soon."
[V],psspss,2013-05-23T04:15Z,"your such a nice dude 

yeh it was 4am in morning and had 5 hours sleep been busy converting and sorting out the media server with new drives after a rebuild.. so expect english to be choppy at times.. try reading and typing small font with fog and floaters in your eyes its no fun when your health is affected"
[V],psspss,2013-05-23T04:17Z,and I agree the docu did suck.. it didnt flow nicely and I kinda thought his mom was a nutter and wasnt paranormal didnt see much paranormal evidence of such no wall bangs or mom talking tongues or levitating
,ToneZone,2013-05-24T03:04Z,"I haven't watched this yet but I'm a bit bummed that you guys say it sucks.  :

I'll admit to downloading Xvid's but that's if no x264 is available.  Easy to see that x264 provides better quality with smaller size.  I made the change a few years ago so the support for older device excuse is played out by now.  For those who play videos through their PS3's & XBox's... get a wireless BluRay or DVD player that handles these file types and save the wear and tear on those soon to be outdated gaming consoles.
My 2 cents."
[V],psspss,2013-05-24T03:36Z,"its just our opinions.. its still worth a watch if never seen it and make up own mind. I think if your religious you like it more.. its funny how its seems religious people seem to have these demons and take overs.

as for xvid.. the main reason i do it is it will play on more gear so has a greater audience im not debating xvid as better then mp4s etc.. we already know this

im about finding content I love (and want to share, nothing to do with egos or rippping of people) and getting it out there and in a way people can watch on the road. without being tied to a big screen or internet connect"
,trxxxpr,2013-05-26T03:35Z,"thankyou. looking forward to watching this,, thanks for you time and share"
