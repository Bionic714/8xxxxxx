Paranormal investigator and documentary filmmaker Chad Calek (Guest Star
and Director of A&E's Paranormal State and The Ghost Prophecies) returns
to his hometown of Persia, Iowa in hopes to put an end to the 20 year
reign of suffering that his family has endured due to an overwhelming
amount of intense negative paranormal activity. Armed with the support
and paranormal knowledge of best friend and paranormal investigator Ryan
Buell (Star and Executive Producer of A&E's Paranormal State), as well
as world renown psychic Lorraine Warren, who's also known for her work
as the primary investigator in the Amityville and Enfield Poltergeist
cases, Calek is determined to not only solve the mysteries as to why the
paranormal phenomena initially began, but also to finally bring an end
to the activity that has been tormenting his family for over two decades.
