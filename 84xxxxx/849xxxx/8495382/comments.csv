,anab0lix,2013-05-21T23:42Z,"Very easy installation and NO game save problems with this rip!!

Saves fine during game play and runs smooth!

Thank you!"
,enos_one,2013-05-22T00:17Z,"thanks for returning with the information, anab0lix. I'll download this now. Love the 3DS version (which I still play), but god damn my hands get so cramped. No cramping with an Xbox controller."
,enos_one,2013-05-22T00:17Z,"Forgot to mention, I'll test out the 3D on this version with my Nvidia 3d vision kit."

""Failed to open file. DVD1nativePCsystemshaderShaderPackage.mfx3""

Any help on this please? "
,anab0lix,2013-05-23T08:40Z,"Just finished the game and I have to say, wished this game came out sooner for other consoles!

Very good game considering it was ported from the DS.  Pretty good graphics, good game play, great story, lots of fun.
8.5/10!

Loved the ending and the intro to ""Lost in Nightmare"" DLC part.

Thanks for the upload!

P.S.  Now I believe ""Lost into Nightmare"" DLC will surely be released for PC.  Hopefully.."
