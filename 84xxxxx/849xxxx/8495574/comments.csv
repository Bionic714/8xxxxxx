,tomboboogie,2013-05-23T19:24Z,A heads up for those interested: At least Vol. 33 is missing several tracks not sure about any of the others. Vol. 10 & 33 are also 192kbps. This flawed torrent has been floating around for several years now.
,pmp317,2013-05-30T09:05Z,"This is a torrent I put together after receiving these from a friend on Soulseek and after closer inspection found that tomboboogie is correct in that there are a handful of missing tracks and a few of the discs are in 128 and 196 kb/s. This being said I vowe to search out the missing tracks and re-upload the discs below 320 kb/s and include the link to the revised version below shortly just as soon as I do but this torrent will download quickly and should be more than 90+% of the material to get you started if you want to take it upon yourself to fill in the blanks, Sorry I uploaded it without thoroughly inspecting it before hand as it probably was dl'ed by him from the incomplete torrent source the the previous commentator was referring to but not where I got it as I don't re-pack incomplete torrents knowingly I must make clear!"
