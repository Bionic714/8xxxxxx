The one hour show plays like a long infomercial, showcasing Egyptian architecture, as a voice-over narrates different facts that have little or nothing to do with what we're seeing.

Sadly, the cameraman and editor made a pretty sloppy effort, and you'll probably catch yourself wondering why the heck they kept a shot of a man looking questioningly into the camera for 10 seconds, or why they constantly cut into pictures that have nothing to do with the voice-over. The disassociated experience makes it seem they haphazardly edited together a bunch of scenes first, and then slapped some music and the voice without making any adjustments to the images.

Seeing the pyramids is always nice, but this film shows nothing you haven't seen on hundreds of travel shows before. The presentation is severely lacking a host who talks to some locals or tries some strange food, and the 3D is utterly wasted."
