After a car wreck on the winding Mulholland Drive renders a woman amnesic, she and a perky Hollywood-hopeful search for clues and answers across Los Angeles in a twisting venture beyond dreams and reality.

Mulholland Drive makes little sense, even for a Lynch film, but its dreamlike imagery is mesmerizing, and Watts delivers a great performance.
