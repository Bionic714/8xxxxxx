NOTE FOR x86 USERS : for some reason x86-patch.exe patches the original pdexpl.exe which wasn't installed on any of my machines (XP Pro/Win7 x86/Win7 x64)
it now uses PDExploNXP.exe
to fix this extract the original " pdexplo.exe " from " pdexplo.rar " into your install folder BEFORE you run the patch
