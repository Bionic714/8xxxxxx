[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-21T14:47Z,"Ed's radio show time slot certainly hasn't changed.

When he used to be on here in San Diego years ago and I was at work, he came on from 12 to 3 Pacific time.  I was able to hear him while working!"
[T],480v,2013-05-23T02:09Z,"Didn't San Diego lose its progressive station a couple years ago? I'm sure show times changed since then or perhaps they just didn't broadcast Ed live. Anyway you're right, Ed's show is @ 12pm, but for the west coast, it's 9am."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-23T19:21Z,"I don't even remember what our progressive station was -- it was in 2004 when I heard Big Eddie off-air! 

But yes, we lost him here.  Not sure if Randi aired here or not, but it's possible."
