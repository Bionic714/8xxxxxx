This is the complete 'Beyond the Frontier' series of 3 books, the sequel to the 'Lost Fleet' series, a space opera by Jack Campbell.

From Wikipedia:
Admiral Black Jack Geary is given command of the "First Fleet" and sent to the far side of space. The series follows Geary as he leads the fleet through previously unexplored star systems, and to explore the threat of the previously encountered non-human "Enigma" race.

There are 3 aubiobooks in this series. I suggest reading or listening to the 'Lost Fleet' series first. I have already posted the audiobooks here:
