se tiver portugues o mais certo é ser PT-BR.

mas duvido que tenha,deve ser só em inglês e nas linguas habituais neste tipo de jogos."

,CADETbrazil,2013-05-25T05:36Z,Not able to set video to 1440x900. Any tip ? Thanks
,virtualmatrix258,2013-05-27T13:28Z,"@chriscrash Where's your proof? I need sources to believe that statement. Actually, the real problem is that the U.S. ISP infrastructure is shit and the U.S. has the worst speeds in the world. So don't blame people for blocking their upload, blame the big businesses not updating their infrastructure and keeping us in the 1960's."
