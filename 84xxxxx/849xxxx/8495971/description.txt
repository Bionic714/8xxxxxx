Game information:
 
Resident Evil Revelations returns redefined  for  PC  complete  with  high
quality HD visuals, enhanced  lighting  effects  and  an  immersive  sound
experience. This latest version of Resident  Evil  Revelations  will  also
deliver  additional  content  including  a  terrifying  new  enemy,  extra
difficulty mode, integration with  ResidentEvil.net  and  improvements  to
Raid Mode. Raid Mode, which was first introduced  to  the  series  in  the
original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online  in
co-op mode or alone in single player  taking  on  the  hordes  of  enemies
across a variety of missions whilst leveling  up  characters  and  earning
weapon  upgrades.  New  weapons,  skill  sets,  and  playable   characters
including  Hunk,  take  the  Raid   Mode   experience   to   new   depths.
 
The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back  to  the
events that took place between  Resident  Evil  4  and  Resident  Evil  5,
revealing the truth about the T-Abyss  virus.  Resident  Evil  Revelations
features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris  Redfield,  plus  their
respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action
begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the  'Queen  Zenobia',
where horrors lurk around  every  corner,  before  players  head  for  the
mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia.  With  limited  ammo  and
weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of  Resident  Evil
Revelations.
 
 
Features:

* Enhanced visual and aural fidelity - Resident Evil Revelations brings
  spine-chilling fear complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced
  lighting effects and an immersive sound experience.
* Classic survival horror gameplay returns - the campaign mode's single
  player experience sees gamers investigating a range of different
  locations including the dark confined spaces of a cruise ship and the
  treacherous snow covered mountains. With limited ammo and weapons, fight
  off infected enemies that lurk around every corner.
* Hell just got hotter - Infernal Mode, a new difficulty mode for the
  re-mastered HD edition, is not just more challenging than Easy and
  Normal modes but also remixes enemy and item placement, so even those
  familiar with the game will discover new terrors.
* Meet the Wall Blister - A brand new enemy, the Wall Blister is a mutated
  creature borne from the T-Abyss virus that spreads through water, adding
  to the horrors that lurk around every corner.
* Residentevil.net support - Resident Evil Revelations will take full
  advantage of Residentevil.net with content available to users once the
  game launches. Earn weapons and custom parts and use them in-game,
  collect figures that can be used in dioramas and check your stats
  through the online web service.
* Improved Raid Mode - New weapons, skill sets, playable characters
  including Rachel and Hunk and enemies exclusive to this mode are added
  for the this latest version.
* Use your equipment - Analyze enemies and investigate areas with the
  Genesis scanner to reveal hidden items.
