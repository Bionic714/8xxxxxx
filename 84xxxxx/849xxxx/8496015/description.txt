Tuesday 05-21-2013: Joe Glenton - Former British Soldier

In the military, following orders isn't a choice, it's an obligation. So what happens when a soldier says no? Joe Glenton was that soldier. When ordered to re-join the British army deployment in Afghanistan he fled. When he eventually returned he spent time in a military prison. He emerged a convinced anti-war campaigner. So is his a story of cowardice or bravery?
