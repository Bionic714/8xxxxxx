The complete issues of The Entheogen review are sold on CD for $40 here: 
http://www.entheogenreview.com/subscribe.html

The PDFs on that CD are separated per issue and without an OCR layer for the years 92-97 (the PDFs for those years are scanned, i.e. raster).

The idea behind this torrent is to provide the collection as a single file with an OCR layer for the raster years, so all issues are now searchable. 

If you like this PDF, please consider buying the CD or at least donating to the Entheogen Review. If you don't feel the importance of supporting these people, you haven't been listening to your shrooms. This can be remedied as follows: ingest a larger amount, lay in silent darkness (to quote the Irish bard), and think about reality for a while. 

Then donate to The Entheogen Review, and if you have some time left, try to help save the world.
