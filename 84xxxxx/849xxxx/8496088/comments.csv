,Tiga1234,2013-05-21T18:33Z,"stuck at 19%, please seed"
,Jailroll,2013-05-21T18:57Z,I suppose you haven't found that purified album yet Torrents?
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-21T20:59Z,"Tiga1234, the torrent is only a couple hours old.  Please give me some time to reach 100% before you complain you're stuck at 19%.  You're stuck at 19% because EVERYONE only has 19% so far."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-21T21:00Z,"Jailroll, not yet my friend.  But it remains on my mind."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-21T21:00Z,"Nathan.S, glad you're able to benefit from these torrents.  God bless ya my brother!"
,Weston0175,2013-05-21T21:04Z,"Hey TT, Do you have a discography of A Hope For Home? They are awesome! Look 'em up!"
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-21T21:09Z,"Weston0175, the name doesn't sound familiar but that doesn't mean I don't have it.  I'll have to check my collection later for you."
,freakforyeshua2,2013-05-22T04:55Z,Another great one TT. Tnxs so much alot of good ones on this one folks. Just keep seeding to spread the word.
,Weston0175,2013-05-24T00:01Z,Did you ever have a discography of Bethany Dillon?
,Weston0175,2013-05-24T03:49Z,Ashley Cleveland? Bean Bag? Both are very good. Do you have them?
,Weston0175,2013-05-24T04:12Z,And TT...you may kill me for asking this...but could you reboost some of your big tent revival torrents? :)
,PaleoPirate,2013-05-24T07:34Z,"Hey TT, thanks for all the awesome music! Couple quick requests: Knock Down Drag Outs by House of Heroes would be epic, and if you could put together a Smalltown Poets discography, you would win the internet for at least a month and a half. "
,Tiga1234,2013-05-24T16:03Z,"Can you find the Veggie Rocks album by Various Artists for Bundle 18 for me. 

It is a VeggieTales CD that was released in 2004. The CD consists of covers of VeggieTales songs by christian bands like Skillet and Newsboys. "
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-24T23:52Z,"Weston0175, I'll put together, and torrent discographies for Bethany Dillon, Beanbag, and Ashley Cleveland shortly.  Lord willing, I'll also try to boost along those Big Tent Revivals for you."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-24T23:53Z,"PaleoPirate, I've been keeping an eye open for that new House Of Heroes release.  I'll be sure to share it when it comes my way.  In the mean while, I have 18 other House of Heroes titles which I'll post shortly.  You may or may not have some of them."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-24T23:56Z,"Tiga1234, it is very clear that you are ""totally"" missing the point of these bundles.  And that baffles me.  It's called ""2013 - The Year In Christian Music"" for a reason ... I only share newly released 2013 music in these bundles.  To ask me to break that trend and toss in a 2004 Veggie Tales would be mindless.  But I do have what you're looking for, so I will share a Veggie Tales discography here shortly."
,freakforyeshua2,2013-05-28T19:32Z,busy day for you today I see (lots of bundles - sweet). As A request would you be posting the new Adelaine - Currents soon? Tnx & PTL
,freakforyeshua2,2013-05-28T20:56Z,P.S. Also looking for Foreverlin - Long Lost :)
,rjisnumber1,2013-06-03T21:26Z,Great torrents!!  Thanks so much.  Do you think you could upload an Elevation Worship Discography torrent?
