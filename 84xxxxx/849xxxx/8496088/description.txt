2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've been following any of my torrents here on The Pirate Bay, you'll know that I am often asked to share discographies.  And although I certainly don't mind investing the effort to gather and create the discography, it is a little disheartening when, in some cases after only 24 hours or less, the discography dies because nobody who downloaded it bothered to stay around to seed/support it.

To anyone wanting to rejuvenate an old discography of mine, but perhaps don't know how, here's a quick walk through...  (1) find the torrent you want to share (2) make a copy of your previously downloaded folder.  I suggest making a duplicate copy to ensure nothing happens to your original.  (3) click on, and download the dot torrent file  (4) rename the copied folder to the same file name as the dot torrent file you just downloaded.  So, for example, your copied folder might simply be called "33 Miles", where as the dot torrent file was called "33 Miles Discography 2007-2010 (3 Releases)"  (5) open your torrent client  (6) within your client, now open that dot torrent file you downloaded in Step #3 above  (7) your client will think you are a downloader so it will ask you where you want to save the music to.  Point it to the location where you performed Step #2.  Your client will then realize you already have the songs, and you will become a seeder.

Thank you for helping.  :)
