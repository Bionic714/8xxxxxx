,templefugate,2013-05-31T23:19Z,I watched an aqos dl my neighbor got here. It was on a 65 inch Sharp Aquos and the set said the rez was 1080. The vid was great looking and the sixe was around 800 megs. So I thought I should get over here and see if I could track this great uploader down. Most of these say 720 so I'm can't figure out which one it was. Has anyone played this or one of the others and gotten a 1080 on you screen?
