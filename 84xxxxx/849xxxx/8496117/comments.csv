,Kingsanx,2013-05-21T19:22Z,Nice. Thanks Nt!  Btw Why don't you have a skull? :/ You're content is good. Been posting awhile now.
,carmitaccd,2013-05-22T00:53Z,they got demoted because all the release groups are jelous
,2.5Kburn,2013-05-22T02:56Z,"No, he's already said exactly why he got 'demoted'.
And it makes perfect sense.
I still support his releases, but those skulls have meaning and certain criteria.
He doesn't need a skull, we know his releases are reliable.
Anyways, keep up your solid work, nos.
A great release, as always."

,2.5Kburn,2013-05-23T02:35Z,"@shadowgamer1992:
So, to be clear, you added the torrent on your torrent software, started the torrent from within the software, and nothing happened?
Because otherwise, you just need to start the download, as is usually the case."
,NakanoSan,2013-05-24T12:50Z,"I know you guys repack, but do we have any news on the Rachel Ooze and Lady HUNK Raid Mode DLC unlocking? They're already in the ingame files, accessible through memory editing, but it resets everytime you're done with a stage."
