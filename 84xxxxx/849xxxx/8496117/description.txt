About the Game:

Resident Evil: Revelations returns to the survival horror gameplay of earlier series installments, with returning elements such as a limited supply of ammunition, and more emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving.
The game's camera keeps an over-the-shoulder view from behind the playable character.
The player may move the protagonist while aiming a weapon, and has the option to switch between a first-person and third-person perspective.
A new device, the Genesis, detects items hidden throughout the game's environments.
In 2005, BSAA head Clive R. O'Brian sends out Jill Valentine and her new partner, Parker Luciani, to search for Chris Redfield and his new partner, Jessica Sherawat. 
They have reportedly gone missing and lost contact with HQ during their mission to investigate Veltro's possible reappearance. 
Jill and Parker are sent to search for them at their last known location, the cruise ship SS Queen Zenobia. 
During their search, they encounter several B.O.W.s on the ship infected with the T-Abyss virus, a marine virus derived from the deadly T-Virus.....
