ΓÇó Contemplating a loving God rather than a punitive God reduces anxiety and depression and increases feelings of security, compassion, and love.
ΓÇó Fundamentalism, in and of itself, can be personally beneficial, but the prejudice generated by extreme beliefs can permanently damage your brain.
ΓÇó Intense prayer and meditation permanently change numerous structures and functions in the brain, altering your values and the way you perceive reality.
