,js99912,2013-05-21T20:22Z,"Nothing special needed, no requirements really, just run Setup.exe

Of course the speed of your PC will dictate how well this runs, the Setup script makes a lot of tweaks.

Recommend Windows 7 x86 or x64
Ability to Support OpenGL 2.0 graphics
Most do today, Intel drivers are usually the big problem.  And you need 4GB free hard disk.

This also worsk on Windows 8, just ensure to Run Setup.exe as administrator


**One installed and running, go into task manager and set priority of HD-Frontend.exe to above normal.  You can play around with other settings, but setting just this gives it a solid 20 percent performance boost!"
,pirutluva,2013-05-21T22:00Z,Ok Thanks For Quick Response. Almost Done Downloading. Will Leave A Response When Finished With Install And Let Fellow Users How It Went. Thanx Again...

Flash Player is as touchy in this as any other Android device as Google has moved away from Flash in favor of HTML 5.

To use Flash Player, you MUST use the Opera Mobile Browser that is included, then MOST flash items play fine so long as User Agent is set to Desktop
http://bayimg.com/aAMIcAaeN

This Opera is not the same as the play store Opera at all, I do not recommend you remove it.  I will notify here of updates.

Many Devs use this as a tool ,in addition to Eclipse, to test their Apps.  Every time I put out a release, a bunch of updates have seem to come.

goto

hkey_local_machine/software/bluestacks/android/config
set GlMode to 0

That will get you running, but don't expect the video to be awesome until you get video drivers working in GlMode

BlueStacks decided to push updates, and they don't work to well, and they unroot, and they choose to unistall certain apps from you even if you paid for them.

So for that, run regedit and delete the following

Total Space only 2.00gb.?
how I would like to add another Space for my internal storage to 32gb or 64gb? 

Regards.
"
,js99912,2013-06-03T22:55Z,"thank you!  one of this issues I am currently working on is expanding the file system.  Adding space is not an issue, but distributing it is.  the sparse system expands then doesn't release free space even if you delete.  Thus my torrent could end up being 20+gb even tho most of that space is empty. 

 It's a challenge I am actively working on, but I can give you something to tinker with
http://www.hostfile.nl/files/ijse4572ms/1919/sd8data4.zip

this will give you 4GB data an 8GB SD, BUT if you overwrite without doing a backup, you will be at ""factory default"" conditions.  I wouldn't overwrite the /data.just the SD or you will be stuck in Google initialization limbo and it becomes difficult to get everything back running.

ultimately, I am trying to add a second mount that is ntfs and completely readable in the windows environment for ease of copying and solving the space concerns.

Comments, questions, lemme know,

,cuntoicai,2013-06-04T13:38Z,"Yes. you are correct. I've tried this before using the ""Block Device Tool"". so, I hope you prosper produce something interesting about this ""Android for Windows for Android addiction"". :)
