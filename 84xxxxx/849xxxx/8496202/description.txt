Welcome to Android for Windows 2.1
----------------------------------

This is a complete Android 2.3.4 running environment that runs on Microsoft Windows.  We have taken the hard work of the developers, simplified things and implemented all of tips and tricks in one robust, powerful and fully 
functional operating system.  We at Trip9d0zen are proud to pass on all of that development to the end-user.

-----------------------------------------
This Android revision is by far the most
complete and most compatible, hands down
-----------------------------------------


2.1 Changes
----------------------------
MUCH MORE THAN A x.1 UPDATE!
----------------------------
-Improved video support
-Flash player support
-240DPI graphics
-No more SD, this will install on anything.
-Much improved SETUP script

Installation
------------
run the included Setup.exe


I am very proud of this build.  Install it, and you will now see what Trip9d0zen is going for.  The 2.1 build is a quality build, I promise you, you will not be disappointed!


And some of you actually had the nerve to call me a hack.... yawn
