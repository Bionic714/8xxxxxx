,reeferwarrior420,2013-05-23T17:31Z,Gonna try this since the other link is SLOWWWWW. Plus i prefer torrents over all. Why someone can't upload the patches here is what im wondering -____- I will post back if this works.
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-05-30T22:03Z,It works! Thank youu
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-05-31T22:53Z,are the servers down? cause I haven't been able to log on all morning or afternoon. Help?
,reeferwarrior420,2013-06-04T19:28Z,Confirmed. This works 100% just download and let the game update itself. If you get the CDN error just keep trying until it starts updating. Remember to seed. Enjoy.
