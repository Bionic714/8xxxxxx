,xentrar,2013-05-21T23:57Z,5/5 HQ
,AvidJumper,2013-05-22T07:42Z,5/5 Beautiful quality. Would be better with metadata though.
,AvidJumper,2013-05-23T08:44Z,"Hmm, so WAV can't retain the metadata. Learn something new everyday."

,audiounit,2013-05-31T17:43Z,aiff is same quality as wav and can retain metadata just for your info.  Cheers for the up.
