Elements for Windows machines.

Thank you very much for downloading our newest addition called ELEMENTS!
Elements is a sound looping application just like Comfeo OpenSky although
This app uses visualization to relax not only your mind with eyes closed, but
Now with eyes opened as well.

This will be the only free version available so as of Elements 1.1 update we will
Ask a small fee for it and the app itself will only be available on your favorite appstore/market.

Please do NOT redistribute this app in any way. All its content is copyrighted by Soundgasm-E. Did you find this particular version (V1.0) for sale on the net then please send us an Email to; Comfeo@ymail.com with the link.

Elements uses maximum Bass-Output so its strongly recommended to set your Bass output volume the lowest possible and work your way up for the perfect set Up.
