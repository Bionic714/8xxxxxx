,sid.OafTobark,2013-05-21T18:43Z,It is more of a DVD Screener. Check the sample and screens.
,ClockKing,2013-05-21T19:24Z,Iron Man 3 will be released on Blu-ray and DVD on the 27th of August. 2013.  This is the worst news in the history of bad news!!!!!
,vlane424,2013-05-22T03:58Z,"For the first 15-20 it was telling me that the download would take weeks but I waited to see if it would change and it dropped down to about 4 hours so if it does this to you guys be patient, will post about quality when it finishes :)"
,cajunTroy504,2013-05-22T04:09Z,Why is that release date bad news? This was by far the worst in the Iron Man series. On another note this does not look like a DVD screener rip...looks like a pretty good cam
,maddog7777,2013-05-22T05:20Z,"Edges are too dark for a screener or DVDrip. This is a HDCam version and that is all. It is better than most, but this is not a DVDrip, Screener but rather a Good quality cam. The screen shots were edited in photoshop by the looks of it but over all just a cam version with good audio. I will DL it and post my comments shortly with what this is exactly, but I doubt it is what the title describes it as."
,JeffCC,2013-05-22T05:23Z,A10 V10. Fuck Yeah. Finally
,maddog7777,2013-05-22T06:55Z,"Okay it is an HDcam version and not a DVDrip. However I will give the audio 6 and video 7. The only reason I give it these, are because I do not like Camrips.. HD or not! I do not care how much they cleaned it up. The video is still pretty dark in a lot of scenes, but this is the best Camrip out on TPB. The audio is a bit low! Again I would appreciate it if you guys label the torrents correctly. I do not care if you got them offline from some place else and they labeled it wrong. If you personally watch this and you would have known it is a camrip. I will still give you credit for uploading a somewhat good camrip, but to warn the people is only fair. NOT DVDrip!!!!!!! It is and HDcam rip only. I gave my ratings in this description. Sorry if it low for some of you, I just do not like Camrips and also being mislead...."
,Mike_Bottigheimer,2013-05-22T18:48Z,"same as R6, hd cam."
,maddog7777,2013-05-22T20:24Z,"R6 does not mean HD Cam! It means it came from region 6 China! Camera sources should be broken down into two groups PAL and NTSC! An R6 line would mean it came from a DVD source from China. BlueRay etc.etc.. This should be labeled Camrip and it should not have DVDrip, Scr. or anything to do with R5 R6 (lines) in the title. It should read Camrip or HD camrip and the title of the movie. Nothing more should be included. "
,TruWING,2013-05-23T16:06Z,"Based on the available screen grabs... I'd probably wait for a better copy, people."
,ashwani318,2013-05-23T16:13Z,please up-lode Hindi Pokemon series.please please 
,notgaym82,2013-05-24T18:55Z,"man the screens look shit, only a noob download this thinking its a dvdrip....
wait 4 better copy, realy..."
,blugoo,2013-05-26T04:27Z,'DvDrip' = LOL; '720p' = (LOL)²
,MFINN23,2013-05-26T07:04Z,"Come on uploaders, if it's recorded in a theater just put CAM somewhere in the title please."
,auditor86,2013-05-26T23:35Z,"Keep in mind that you are downloading for free before commenting.
A=7 V=6"
,mustikonika,2013-05-28T15:15Z,cool
,St.City,2013-05-29T16:09Z,"Yes, its HDCam but most perfect!"
,nbmatt,2013-05-31T22:39Z,A 720p DVDrip? Where I can I learn how to harness such dark magic?
,pennknig,2013-06-01T18:38Z,"Lousy, out of sink, boxy, monoish audio.....
Crappy picture......NOT HD in any form!,,,,720/1080.....CAM IS A CAM!!!
a/4
v/4
m/only watched 5 min then deleted.

For me, not watchable., I will wait till a dvd rip is available.

I hate cams, uploader could of stated 'CAM' in the description.......... "
,Polyblendz,2013-06-02T11:07Z,Why put on dvdrip??!!! NOWHERE NEAR AS CLOSE! I dont care If I downloaded this for free nor would I come back to even read anyone's response to my comment. Misleading us by using dvdrip was the first mistake!
,jalucian,2013-06-07T08:16Z,"Why is that a VIP can get away with dishonest labeling? This kind of thing should be grounds for losing the skull. 

1) It's not a DVDRip, and
2) Even if it was, DVDs are 480p or at best 576p. 720p is an HD/blu-ray resolution. 

Who is this supposed to fool?"
,ManuelRivero,2013-06-11T20:16Z,"Looks like an upscaled CAM. Pretty good for a CAM, but no need to fake resolution by upscaling it."
