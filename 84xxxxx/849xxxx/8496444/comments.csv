When latebyte.nl gets the following, would you post them as well? Thanks!
Jay.Leno.2013.05.20
Jimmy.Fallon.2013.05.20

I would also ask for Jimmy.Kimmel.2013.05.20, but I know latebyte.nl doesn't carry Kimmel."
,LateByte2,2013-05-22T19:11Z,"Of course my friend. However, I rip them for latebyte and then post them on here. So I'm never waiting on anyone other than myself. But I have limited seed capacity and because scene are being particularly bad at capping at the moment, there's only so much I can make available. "
,LateByte2,2013-05-22T19:22Z,"But were are currently discussing adding Kimmel, considering his increased presence in the late night landscape."
,LateByte2,2013-05-22T19:43Z,"Plus the NBC based shows are very difficult to rip, it's a bit pot luck if I can keep the stream stable enough."
