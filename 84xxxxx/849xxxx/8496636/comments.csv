Dude, I do appreciate the post...

BUT, what is it with you and AC3 @640 these days?

The DTS takes up maybe, what, another few hundred Gigs and sounds a HELL of a LOT better!  I mean, why not just make a little more space for it?

Don't you think that there is a LOT more of a quality jump in the sound from AC3 to DTS then merely allowing a bit more space for the video, especially since your encodes are so good...?

Sorry, I truly don't mean to complain, but for the little space involved and the HUGE jump in sound quality, I just don't understand it.

Thanks sincerely though!"
