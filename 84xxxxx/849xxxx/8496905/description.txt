Overview
ΓÇ£Either the Constitution means what it says, or it doesnΓÇÖt.ΓÇ¥

AmericaΓÇÖs founding fathers saw freedom as a part of our nature to be protectedΓÇönot to be usurped by the federal governmentΓÇöand so enshrined separation of powers and guarantees of freedom in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. But a little over a hundred years after AmericaΓÇÖs founding, those God-given rights were laid siege by two presidents caring more about the advancement of progressive, redistributionist ideology than the principles on which America was founded.

Theodore and Woodrow is Judge Andrew P. NapolitanoΓÇÖs shocking historical account of how a Republican and a Democratic president oversaw the greatest shift in power in American history, from a land built on the belief that authority should be left to the individuals and the states to a bloated, far-reaching federal bureaucracy, continuing to grow and consume power each day.

With lessons rooted in history, Judge Napolitano shows the intellectually arrogant, anti-personal freedom, even racist progressive philosophy driving these men to poison the American system of government.

And Americans still pay for their legacyΓÇöin the federal income, in state-prescribed compulsory education, in the Federal Reserve, in perpetual wars, and in the constant encroachment of a government that coddles special interests and discourages true competition in the marketplace.

With his attention to detail, deep constitutional knowledge, and unwavering adherence to truth telling, Judge Napolitano moves through the history of these men and their times in office to show how American values and the Constitution were sadly set aside, leaving personal freedom as a shadow of its former self, in the grip of an insidious, Nanny state, progressive ideology.

Fox News regular and former New Jersey judge Napolitano (Constitutional Chaos) seeks to prove that presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were not heroes but A-list bad guys.. Napolitano claims that Roosevelt and Wilson ΓÇ£pushed aside the traditionally accepted and constitutionally mandated restrictions on the federal government and used it as an instrument to redistribute wealth, regulate personal behavior, enrich the government, and enhance the governmentΓÇÖs health with wars.ΓÇ¥ With the draft, instituted by Wilson in WWI, the U.S. instituted ΓÇ£a form of slavery and therefore tyranny.ΓÇ¥ Napolitano repeatedly links what he views as RooseveltΓÇÖs and WilsonΓÇÖs Progressive era folly and perfidy to the present, claiming that Wilson instituted the federal income tax we know today, which the authors calls ΓÇ£theftΓÇ¥ and that, thanks to RooseveltΓÇÖs foreign meddling, the U.S. is the ΓÇ£most imperialistic country in the history of the world.ΓÇ¥ This hit job takes on the Federal Reserve, compulsory education, industrial regulation, and race with equal lack of subtlety. Roosevelt and Wilson, according to Napolitano, were agents of central economic planning. Whatever political points Napolitano is trying to score, he doesn't accomplish
