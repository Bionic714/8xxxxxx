,Timbo6669,2013-05-22T03:58Z,"Most logitech hardware comes with software to run and modify control inputs...This can be wrongly prioritized in your cpu, therefore reading that whilst trying to read the game...can jitter and lag cause of it..."
,micnor14,2013-05-26T23:17Z,@Timbo6669 Not that it was an issue with me; but god bless your kind soul for explaining that so well. I've seen this issue with a few friends of mine. 
,micnor14,2013-05-26T23:20Z,Also; why is this update 17mb as opposed to Reloaded's update by Mr.Stifmeister? Maybe this is assuming you already have the updated 1.01 main files or something?
