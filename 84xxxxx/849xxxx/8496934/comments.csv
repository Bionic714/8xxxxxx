,hatepig,2013-05-23T05:14Z,Really? Someone can complain about having THIS movie spoiled for them?
,drcat123,2013-05-23T13:03Z,did anybody actually think he is lying about it? duh
,ratina,2013-05-23T22:25Z,@drcat123 - he wasn't lying.
,7thSense,2013-05-24T06:12Z,"somebody ban ratina and the other spoiler. And they were lying anyways, idiots"
,11western,2013-05-24T06:25Z,"PyreRage....REALLY...spam , nobody here clicks on that shit."
,11western,2013-05-24T06:28Z,"@ 7thSense, Bummer I hate his character on WWE so would love to see him die in a movie. Hell of a wrestler though....and yeah I know it's fake but you can;t fall from a 30' cage and not feel it!"
,bitshlap,2013-05-25T09:16Z,so if the spolier is true... then playing the movie backwards makes this guy like jesus......as he is resurrected.. and we have a religious show on our hands. or not..
,lilbehr,2013-05-26T07:45Z,@hatepig  If you didn't like the movie in the first place why did you go and download it ?  And when when something is for FREE stop complaining about it !!! 
,kidwyfli,2013-05-30T11:33Z,hahaha. bitshlap I thought ive heard it all. haha
,templefugate,2013-05-31T23:21Z,I watched an aqos dl my neighbor got here. It was on a 65 inch Sharp Aquos and the set said the rez was 1080. The vid was great looking and the sixe was around 800 megs. So I thought I should get over here and see if I could track this great uploader down. Most of these say 720 so I'm can't figure out which one it was. Has anyone played this or one of the others and gotten a 1080 on you screen?
,markmathisonMN,2013-06-09T22:59Z,The video and audio are fine; the movie isn't so hot.  SPOILER: The villain goes through all this work just to ''make things right'' with his wife? So we are supposed to believe that some bloke can get immediate access to all CCTVs in the city? Thanks to the uploader.
