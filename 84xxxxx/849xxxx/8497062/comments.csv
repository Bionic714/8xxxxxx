,bonnibel,2013-05-26T06:26Z,"What kind of advanced techniques are we talking about here? I'm kind of hoping you haven't gone down the blurring route, I remember HBO Canada did blurring on some Borgias episodes. Personally I'm all about the freeze frame method that was used earlier by Flame just because it added a bit of lols for expressions and whatnot.

I've been downloading what you've put up so far and I gotta say either way thanks a lot for the time and effort you've put into censoring the useless bits. Really appreciate it!"
,bonnibel,2013-05-26T06:28Z,"I forgot to add that with the blurring, it seems pointless. But that's just my take on it."
,Flame_Leg,2013-05-27T03:01Z,"What he's doing is actually cropping the picture, so you have no black bars, but the still see the people. I didn't even notice a big drop in quality. I'm suspecting you started with a 1080p file, so even after cropping, it was still 720p, or close. Great idea, it would be great if this could work for all the episodes. Seamlessly censor it, so no one will even notice it's censored.

Only complaint, which I'm not even sure about, is that I'm not sure if your adding traditions to the audio where you cut or not. If you don't, it's obvious where you cut, since the music cuts as well. Adding transitions makes it seem as if the cut was originally there. 

Other than that, and maybe the cropping getting a a little closer to showing things than I would have done, this is a perfect edit."
,Flame_Leg,2013-06-03T14:52Z,"Hey guys, FYI, episode 9 is clean, no need for edits.

Not sure if you plan to release the 10th episode separately or not, but I have a few requests for the bulk season 3 torrent.

1. Do you plan to redo the other episodes using cropping, versus black bars? That would be great, since it's almost as if it isn't censored.

2. Although your video quality doesn't seem to suffer from the small file size, the sound quality has a noticeable drop in quality. Perhaps you could uop the quality of the sound. I don't think people would mind it being 20-30mb bigger if it had better sound quality.

3. As I said in my previous post, it would be great if you added transitions to the audio(not video) when you cut. This makes it seem more natural, and not obvious that you cut it.

Thanks so much for all the hard work!"

,Iluivatar,2013-06-04T05:12Z,"Wow! The cropping thing works really, really well. I hate it when I know the show is being censored or if something is skipped. I feel like I am missing something even if it isn't important. When it's like this it's so seamless... If you I have time it would be nice to have it for every episode (in every season)."

,LifeTheHound,2013-06-04T10:11Z,"Thanks! Yep, it's an adaptive AR-preserving ""floating"" crop, along with straight crops and some extremely subtle body-blurs. Betcha can't spot 'em unless you watch the original and compare! Some audio transitions were used, but you seem to have caught the places they weren't. You're too good, as expected of my mentor-in-spirit. 

I have plans to censor a painting in episode 3 (non-intrusive), and some rear ends in episode 5 (bath). All new censors will be of this more advanced type. I may re-censor some earlier cuts as well (a good suggestion). 

As for the audio quality, I used some dynamic range compression and reduced channels from 5.1 to 2.0. I did both to optimize for playback on all systems (including laptops, portable systems, 2-speaker TV's, etc). I personally do not notice any reduction of quality on casual watching -- this is probably because I do both of these things (dynamic range compression and channel reduction) by default on all such content including Blurays. 

Or was there a different type of quality reduction you're talking about? Some PC's have special filters and enhancements that only activate when AC3 audio is detected -- nothing I can do about that short of muxing in the original 5.1 channel AC3, which is quite problematic in MP4 (and many other devices/systems). Cranking up the bitrate will not change any of these three realities (dynamic range compression, 2.0 channel playback, no AC3 triggering). I can make it uniformly louder though, if desired! (Though I doubt that's the issue.)

Amazing episode 9 is clean. That makes 3 episodes in one season (so far) that do not need censoring. Happy times!"

,Flame_Leg,2013-06-04T15:51Z,"I actually must be the sound level. It is much lower compared to other releases, and if your watching it on a compute with headphones, this isn't a problem, but on a television this means that if you higher the television, and computer all the way, it still can be too low to hear.

There are workarounds, such as using players that allow over 100% volume, but some people might not mess with those. I think it would be better if you raises the overall volume to be something closer to the originals."
,LifeTheHound,2013-06-06T02:27Z,"Aha! Thanks for testing. 

The reason the original was so loud on your system is because of the third reason I mentioned above -- the system detects the AC3 and auto-levels it. The volume on my releases is actually about 250% of the original, but I'll raise it to something like 400% from now on (this is closer to what Dolby Digital's ""medium"" DRC does, although I've seen theirs go as high as 500%). 

Will definitely do this for the batch!"
,Iluivatar,2013-06-10T05:44Z,I'm not positive but it looks like episode 10 is clean too.
,Myraje,2013-06-10T11:22Z,Can someone please verify is episode 10 is clean or not? Dying to find out what happens!
,Myraje,2013-06-10T11:27Z,Could anyone verify if Episode 10 is clean? Thanks.
,sailerfan,2013-06-10T13:07Z,"Ep 10 *seems* clean... skimmed through it and didn't see any. Bring on the full season 3 release!

LifeTheHound, will you be redoing any of the previous seasons?  I like your crop+zoom technique better than the black bars.
"
,Flame_Leg,2013-06-10T16:23Z,"I just watched episode 10, no nudity or cussing. I guess they realized they didn't have to have as much nudity this season to keep peoples interest, since they have a large fan-base now."
,wanted93,2013-06-11T20:55Z,thanQ for this....
,LifeTheHound,2013-06-12T20:32Z,"Wint--I mean, a batch is coming. I am doing some audio volume tweaks, censoring tweaks in episode 3, and including the episodes I skipped (the ones which didn't need censoring). 

All in all, forty percent of this season's episodes did not need censoring. This is a huge difference from the previous seasons, as flame_leg can attest. "
,Flame_Leg,2013-06-13T06:03Z,"Yeah, every single episode of the other seasons had nudity.

So you decided not to re-censor the other episodes in the new cropped way? I think it would be great for increasing the overall quality of the torrent.

Also, did you plan on re-censoring episode 5 bath scene, since you left all the rear end nudity in."
