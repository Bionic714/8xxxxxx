This is round 2 of the most exciting tag match this season. 4 of U/S's elite wrestlers on the mat. It's non-stop back and forth action. There was a lot of use of the legs in this round. The Wrestlers realized that trapping their opponents head with their legs allows them to score points even if they are on the bottom. There are moments when there is double control where both wrestlers had leg scissors around each others head. It was do or die. The wrestler to give up the position first may cost her time the win.
