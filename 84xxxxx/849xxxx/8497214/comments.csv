On a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is unwatchable and 10 is DVD, I'll give this a solid 6.5. Video and audio is ok.
It's still a cam, but I've rarely seen better encodes, and this is infinitely better than the other crappy encodes of the same source.
Below is the info.

Star Trek Into Darkness 2013 CAM NEW AUDiO XViD - JUSTiCE



SOURCE : YouTube 2mins 30 secs and PSO  AUDIO : A Good Friend.


Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....


Ok first off took the youtube first 10mins clip and cut what was needed,so no repeated
scenes on this one.
From there i had to clean the PSO release up ...opted to resize it aswell,but the AR does dift
from the work PSO did.
Will pre warn those that don't already know....this video does have a scrolling pluse/flicker that
comes and goes and also has several blur marks throughout the video ...mostly in the bottom left
and right corners.
Flicker does look worse on a pc/lappy ....i've viewed this on my small 23"" tv before releasing this and
for a cam its not too bad both video and audio.
Audio as been syncd and pretty sure is dam close throughout ...might slip a little where the video was cut
by pso also there was a few little glitches in the video that also through the sync out but fixed most if not
all of them.

Anyway ....there is line but heard its waiting for a better video,so until then....
