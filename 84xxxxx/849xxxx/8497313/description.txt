winNC 5

Looking for a filemanager for Windows 7?

WinNc 5 is a tabbed file manager especially developed for Windows 7. It also works on the older versions of Windows. This NC clone file manager is inspired on the dual panel idea of the old file manager Norton Commander.

It has shortcuts to all the Windows 7 special folders and the tabbed interface allows you to organize your data by project. Projects can include files and folders from all over the disk that are somehow connected to that project tab.

With a new Windows 7 interface WinNc can do all the basic tasks you expect from a file manager like copy, move, delete, compress, uncompress and create links.

But WinNc also converts audio, burns files on dvd and cd, create iso files and you are able to synchronize your files. From zip files it allows the creation of self extraction .exe files 

Supported OS:

Windows 7/vista/xp
