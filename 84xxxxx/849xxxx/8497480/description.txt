Conviction (Club Destiny #1) by Nicole Edwards (July 29th 2012)

Samantha Kielty only thought she knew who she was and what she was made of. Until she was offered a position that would take her from her small office in San Antonio, Texas to that of her companyâ™s larger, more upscale headquarters in Dallas, Texas, Sam hadnâ™t seen anything. Her new boss was not only intensely sexy, he was also about to show her things she had only read in books.

Logan McCoyâ™s life was steady going until he set his sights on his new Vice President of Project Operations. The woman makes his blood boil and makes him want things he hadnâ™t realized he was in search of. Logan only hopes that Samantha is capable of handling his dominating, controlling ways… especially between the sheets, or in the shower.

When Logan and Sam get together, sparks fly and they bring out each otherâ™s deepest, darkest desires. He will push Sam past her sexual boundaries, and she will bring out his need to possess her in every way. But, can they find love within the inferno that burns between them?

When he unleashes her deepest, darkest fantasies, she finds herself in a position she doesn't want to get out of.

Luke McCoy has run fast and hard from the demons that chase him. The hot, fierce need that pushed him beyond the boundaries he hadn't realized heâ™d erected resulted in a two month hiatus from the world heâ™d built for himself. A world concreted in lust and forbidden fantasies. So when his twin brother Logan introduces him to Sierra, Luke finds himself up against another temptation that he canâ™t resist.

Cole Ackerley never backs down from a challenge, but that was before heâ™d been intimately introduced to Luke McCoy. Throw in the black haired vixen with the glowing blue eyes, and Cole finds himself engulfed in a menage hot enough to rival the sun. When his feelings for both of them ignite, Cole learns the true meaning of self-restraint.

The deep, soul scorching hunger that ignites between the three of them turns into a firestorm of sensuality and lust that only burns brighter and hotter with every encounter.
