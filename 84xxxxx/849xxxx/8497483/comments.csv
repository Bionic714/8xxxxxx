Then I happened across your torrent, popped that claud.sim into audio filter and main directory, BANG, it is working, THANK YOU, LEGENDARY."

You're most welcome."
,slamm6,2013-05-23T01:23Z,"Yes, I too tried all the versions out there with no luck.  This sounds promising.  Before I go through all the hassle of uninstalling 12, is this the only file I'll need to replace in the retail version of 13 ?  Thanks in advance."
,samax92,2013-05-23T19:57Z,"1. Install CL PDVD13
2. Use any crack you find
3. Put CLAud.sim in:
    CyberLinkPowerDVD12
                 and
    CyberLinkPowerDVD12CommoAudioFilter

Bongoo..."
,pirate_pacman,2013-05-24T21:24Z,"Not on Windows 8 x64. First of all, there is no such thing as a ""CyberLinkPowerDVD12"" catalogue in the PDVD13 installation. Secondly, following those prescriptions closely in a CyberLinkPowerDVD13 context does not yield the desired result.

Conclusion, gentlemen: This shit doesn't work on Windows 8 x64."
,samax92,2013-05-25T00:12Z,"Sorry pirate_pacman,

Look for: CyberLinkPowerDVD13
and
CyberLinkPowerDVD13CommoAudioFilter  instead of CyberLinkPowerDVD12
and
CyberLinkPowerDVD12CommoAudioFilter   after installing CL-PDVD13

It was my mistake of typing,, surely it will work.. "
,erdi85,2013-06-05T15:49Z,"thanks, works :)"
,k00lf11re,2013-06-05T18:25Z,Tested this in exact same way as mentioned and also tried many other permutations/combinations of CLAud.sim / SE_CLAud.sim and PowerDVD.sim but this doesnt work for Windows 8 x64.
,sdsucks,2013-06-08T09:11Z,"audio works alright, but dvd/blu-ray playback still don't work. tried on win7x64 with so-called retail version of pdvd."
