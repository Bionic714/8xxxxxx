Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, May 21 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex gives his analysis of radio host and political prisoner Adam Kokesh's incarceration, relaying key intel regarding the charges leveled against him. 

Alex continues to break down the scandals impacting the White House that have left Obama with nearly half of Americans wanting him impeached, according to some polls, and also touches on the tragedy in Oklahoma after devastating tornadoes touched down leaving dozens dead in its wake. 

On today's show, Alex welcomes author of The Octopus Deception: A Novel and veteran Bilderberg investigative reporter Daniel Estulin to fill us in on the latest details he has received from inside sources at the secretive globalist confab set to take place June 6-9.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
