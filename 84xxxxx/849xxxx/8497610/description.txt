Sante Dental CT

The aim of the program is to create one or more Curved Multi-planar Reconstructions from a volume of Dental CT slices. Curved Multi-planar Reconstruction (Curved MPR) is a very useful tool in Dental CT. A volume is built by stacking the axial slices one behind the other. Curved Multi-planar Reconstruction involves generating perspectives to the stack of axial slices so that panoramic images and images from paraxial cuts can be generated.

Sante Dental CT's main features:

- The program allows the user to insert many panoramic lines 
- The program can generate automatically paraxial lines perpendicular to segments of a panoramic line. The user can add paraxial lines manually as well 
- The program allows the user to perform measurements (length, angle) in the panoramic and paraxial images 
- The program allows the user to annotate the panoramic and paraxial images with texts and arrows 
- The program can print a synthesis of a panoramic image and its paraxial images 
- The paraxial images are printed in 1:1 scale (full scale)
