Hi guys! Butcherpete bringing you this time the newest electronic version of the comic book made by "Dark Horse Comics": The Last Of Us - American dreams (Issue 1).

For the fans excited with the prequel, you're lucky, because I just got my hands on the first issue :D

The second issue is being released on the 29th of May 2013.

The third issue is being released on the 26th of June 2013.

The fourth and last issue will be released around 20th July 2013, but yet with no official date.


 I'll try to upload all these issues ASAP.


In the same folder there is a software that will let you read the comic book in .cbf format.


Have fun!
