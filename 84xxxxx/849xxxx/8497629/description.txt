Hey,

As I wanted to get a nice FF compilation, there wasn't with best versions easily findable.
So I made one myself, and here it is.

I only included games available on GBA, NDS and PSP.

I did not compress to allow people to download just the ones they want.

Each version is the most complete that was produced (Except for 012 I guess).
I did not include (yet) some spin off.

Don't hesitate to send me a message if anything is wrong or missing.
