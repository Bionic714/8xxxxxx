,nignug,2013-05-22T03:50Z,"fucking hilarious how a lot of people who bought this game are having a better time running it with no cd. seems that the pirated version is running better than the real one, lol."
,spyderx810,2013-05-22T04:34Z,"This a cumulative update/patch. You only need this one to be up to date. 

This patch fixed all the issues I was having. Sure runs better than 2033.

Run the exe in update folder, point it to your installation, then copy over files in the crack folder."

,vis-maior,2013-05-22T23:15Z,"Hi, maybye I'm just retarded, but how the hell am I supposed to install this? Please, step by step! :C

What I'm doing:
1. I have Metro,
2. I start MetroLL.exe
3. Steam launches itself.
4. I'm choosing ""offline""
5. It responds ""game is not ready to be played offline"".

I have to copy whole folder to Metro? Or should I first copy crack, than launch update?

HALP PLOX :p"

,skaterx4707,2013-05-23T17:31Z,"This patch is great, it really improved my performance with my HD5730. Before in DX11 i was getting between 25 and 40 on normal and 20-35 on high. Now it's pretty much 30 FPS. I'm playing again on Ranger Hardcore, so I'm just starting and haven't been to the bigger areas yet, but I'll update."

Only 8 out of 47 antivirus programs identified it as malicious."
,regular6,2013-05-23T21:35Z,"@vis-maior

1. ""Run Metro Last Light Update 3"" inside Update folder.
2. Extract to Game's installation directory.
3. Copy all the files inside the Crack folder.
4. Play and next time read .nfo files (open with notepad, etc.)

Crack is clean according to ESET SS 6"
,segamon,2013-05-24T01:39Z,"i'm having the same problem advait is having. the game boots and few seconds later it lists the configuration settings and stays there. I have to alt-f4.

,Nivekpro,2013-05-27T06:04Z,Whenever I try and continue from my game it says DLC has been removed or corrupted. Anyway to get it back? I'm assuming it was because I was playing with Ranger mode.

,BakUpAllYouCan,2013-05-31T13:50Z,"Started up a-ok! like was said b4 just follow the directions.  the usual steps.  No Problem.

the Benchmark Launcher was wierd.  But yea get use to it.  Meaning there is not a lot of settings.  I used this with a combo of HDPRO to custom the visual sets for the game.
  HINT: 4 benchmark: Runs=how many run threw the benchmark test sequence to see if your FPS and other info.
  DEFAULT=3. I recommend you change to 1. but now im ranting.

Though wish it had more settings.  Will have to ggl an ini file location.
