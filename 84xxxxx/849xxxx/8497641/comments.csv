and then copy all the content from db_a and db_b (sb1 and store from both, db_a and db_b) and paste it in:
//JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database

Can you confirm what software did you use, Im using DiskAid and iTools and I have the same problema that @kenabek.

,V1RotateV2,2013-05-24T10:48Z,"TermCharts work perfectly under JeppTC.

Awaiting JeppView for PC to enable VFR and see if it works the same under JeppFD v.2.0.0."
,twinpics,2013-05-24T20:17Z,"if any of you copied all the content with the app loaded it may not let you rewrite its content, thats why no charts nor routes will show.. so make sure you kill jeppFD before pasting all the content..."
,twinpics,2013-05-24T22:50Z,"it seems that if you use ios 6.3 without JAilbreak it will only let you copy files to any folder Named ""documents"" but wont let you create new ones outside of it.. so thats why yo can use mobileTC, it stores its data inside a folder named Documents but in mobile FD its called differently and it prevents you from writting anything to the ipad, but you can extract info.."
,twinpics,2013-05-24T23:05Z,some Findings: iOS 6 prevents any 3rd party software having write access to the folder “[app_name].app” in all App sandbox from PC/Mac. Other folders like “Documents” and “Library” are still open for write access. No way to fix it shortly.
,kastacas,2013-05-25T03:12Z,anyone who still have v2.00 could share original itune ipa v2.00 not the cracked one thx in advance

,yboubeke,2013-06-01T17:10Z,"hello everyone , to those having trouble in using the enroute charts here is the solution that works only in jepp fd 2.0.0 , the problem is 4 missing files , let's fix them step by step 
1- go to enroute folder in your pc then db_a then store folder 
2- select the file named appedoc_store_1.dat , right click copy and paste , 
3 now you have a new file called appedoc_store_1 copy.dat , rename it as follow appedoc_store_1.lock and ignore the message of changing extention just click ok 
4- in the same folder select the file appenr_store_1.dat , right click copy and paste then rename the copied file to appenr_store_1.lock , and ignore the message of changing extention just click ok 
5 - now go to db_b folder then store and do the same procedure as with db_a folder , 
6 once done you can now copy from your pc to your ipad , go to enroute , db_a , db_1 select all the files then copy them to jeppfd/data-enroute/db_demo/db1 and do the same with db_b/db_1 select all files then copy them to jeppfd/data/enroute/db_demo/db1 and do the same with db_b/db_1 , then go to db_a folder in pc , then store folder select all the files then copy them to jeppfd/data/enroute/db_demo/store and the same with db_b/store folder , copy all the contents to jepp_fd/data/enroute/db_demo/store and the work is done

,jeromepp,2013-06-06T22:11Z,"Hi yboubeke
Any idea how to revert to 2.0.0?
I've iPad4 with iOs 6.1.3, and FD 2.0.6
I deleted FD, and reinstalled 2.0.0. But it asks me for an Apple login, doesn't accept mine and closes...
I can't jailbreak it, as jailbreak doesn't work (yet) with 6.1.3...
Any idea?"
,jeromepp,2013-06-06T22:16Z,"Hi yboubeke,
How to install it on an iPad which already runs iOs 6.1.3. Jailbreak doesn't exists for 6.1.3...
Any idea?
I removed FD 2.0.6 and I tried to reinstall 2.0.0, but it asks me an apple login and closes...
Thanks"
