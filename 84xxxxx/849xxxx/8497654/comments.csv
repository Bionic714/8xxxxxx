You can actually see our bright pink sign in pic 388.jpg!! LOL Paul acknowledged us after ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" with a big smile and a finger waggle. We died. haha"
,owsleysbear,2013-05-23T23:59Z,Awesome!  Glad I could put a smile on your face.  :)
,3rdrocker,2013-05-24T01:50Z,"Definitely! It's awesome to relive through pics and vids. You wouldn't by chance among the photos that didn't make the cut have any pics of us holding up our lighted sign? It said ""Such a Beautiful Knight"" and was between Maybe I'm Amazed and I've Just Seen a Face, if that helps. :)"
,owsleysbear,2013-05-24T03:51Z,I don't have that one.  The only lit sign I took a pic of was the P-A-U-L one.  That's the only one I could see.  I checked them again and nothing unfortunately.  :(
,3rdrocker,2013-05-24T05:24Z,"Awww. Well, I appreciate you checking. :) Still looking for videos on YouTube of it, but everyone cuts off his walk down the stairs except for one. lol"
