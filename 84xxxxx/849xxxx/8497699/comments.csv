The book was called ""explicitly racist and anti-Semitic"" by The New York Times and has been labeled a ""bible of the racist right"" by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
So...unless you are a hatemonger, ya might want to pass on this one."

,kjhgviyvoiyoi,2013-05-23T01:22Z,"I liked this book. It's an action packed pulp fiction. Those who call this ""bible of the racist right"" hasn't read it. There's nothing ""biblical"" or even lecturing about it. Just fiction with racist protagonists, which makes it very entertaining and unusual. It won't turn anyone racist who isn't allready.

I recomend it if you wan't to have some accessible fun and suspense for a couple of hours."

I'm gonna read it to see what's all about. Some say it's  something like ""Nazi bible"" other say it's some bad written fiction.  

The best way to exercise your freedom of speech is after all to get all the info and get your own point of view instead of letting others tell you what to think. "
