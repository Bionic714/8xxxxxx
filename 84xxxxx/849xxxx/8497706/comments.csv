,evildog1,2013-05-27T21:26Z,can you copy a protected dvd?
,Amatyi1,2013-05-28T09:18Z,"Thanks for the upload. The camera moves a little when this big headed dude sits in front of the camera so he re adjusts the camera a little. The audio is a little low, but it's definitely watchable. Video is pretty good for a cam. Great movie. "

,covacsVR,2013-06-02T11:03Z,Audio is missing in between scenes .. (using vlc)..HELP
,covacsVR,2013-06-02T11:18Z,"Audio is missing in most.of.the scenes ..(playing using VLC )
.. please HELP asap"
,TranslucidHorror,2013-06-02T13:11Z,"overall decent cam, a4/v5/m8, enjoyed the movie there were a couple of scenes where the jackass with the cam wouldnt leave it alone, dark scenes are quite dark in a few different scenes. Audio has an echo and is pretty low making some scenes hard to understand but definitely a watchable copy for a cam if you can handle the guy with the camera."
,amper54,2013-06-06T10:48Z,"If audio don't work then switch your player (vlc, winamp, WMV etc etc) to mono sound playback."
