Greetings Internets,

    We are Lulz Security. It has been a while since our last release, long overdue in our opinion. With the recent sentencing of our fellow lulzsec brothers *moment of silence* we have decided to drop some data in their honour. We want to remind internet users, hackers, and officials everywhere that though some may be arrested, you can't arrest us all.....you can't arrest an idea. What we have for you tonight is just a little something.....over 23,500 emails for the internationally known Fortune 500 Companies. You may ask yourself why, why this many emails? Why Fortune 500?
    
        Well....fuck you, that's why. Also, lulz.....never forget the lulz. Oh and no worries....this is just the beginning, we have only just begun. Enjoy ^_^

"This is the Internet, where we screw each other over for a jolt of satisfaction. There are peons and lulz lizards; trolls and victims. There's losers that post shit they think matters, and other losers telling them their shit does not matter. In this situation, we are both of these parties, because we're fully aware that every single person that reached this final sentence just wasted a few moments of their time. (6-17-2011)"
