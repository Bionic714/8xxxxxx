[V],politux,2013-05-22T11:32Z,"Not sure what you mean by ""image"" in this context. 

These are .flac files which means you need to use a media player that supports open formats. (Winamp or VLC Media Player). 

If you are attempting to import the files into iTunes you would need to convert to MP3 or ALAC (Apple Lossless) first.  "
,venerated,2013-05-22T20:10Z,This is real. Thank you so much!
,mickyvocalextremist,2013-05-23T06:27Z,"My mistake, sorry."
,mickyvocalextremist,2013-05-23T06:31Z,The problem i had is that when i attempted to extract the files it asked for a password and took me to a spam dodgy website
,mickyvocalextremist,2013-05-23T06:37Z,"It took me to a survey Apple website which i wasn't interested in to get the password, never mind. I've found another copy of this now on here anyway. Thanks."
[V],politux,2013-05-23T13:59Z,None of the files are an archive so why would you try to extract them? 
,JeanRenoirJR,2013-06-06T03:56Z,Oh what a ful jacket writer. Thank you politux and of course my very best regards to the TPB Team. Truly. /JR
