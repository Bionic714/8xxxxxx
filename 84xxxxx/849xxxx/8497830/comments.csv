I have a doubt
as ur source is bd why do you write BrRip instead of BDRip ?"

@dhjudasx:

Did you noticed that some of your movies are not playing on TV."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-22T04:13Z,"Because most people will never pick on it, and there isn't a world wide consensus on the whole ""bd rip"" vs ""br rip"" Most will just assume they mean the same. There is even arguments still over the term ""BD vs BR""... Does BD refer to Bluray Disk and BR strickly to Bluray, or bluray rip, which is it?

What do they apply to? Would a BDRip mean an ISO of the physical bluray untouched... and BR rip mean strickly using that iso as a source?

I think the overall confusion has left a mess in the uploading world where no one entirely sure of anything, specially with people making Claims that they are using a physical source but aren't. So what is worse?

Either way, I use BrRip simply because it simplistic. I've seen some people with heavily compressed x264 encodings of blurays complain even when the source is physical disc, saying that BDRIP is strickly raw bluray only, no mkv or compression or anything.

Anywho, in my description I list the source as a physical bluray. That is what I use. It's up to the downloader to decide if i'm lying or not, and if they think I am lying, that is there problem as I don't have the time/bandwidth and resources to wait ages to download physical ISO rips of the blurays launched.. I don't trust them, I prefer to do it right and not have to waste all that time.

Thanks for the comments ;)"

if it's lg.... it's likely not up to the task... a common problem with many of the lg smart tvs..."
