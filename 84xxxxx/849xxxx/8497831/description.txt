Jimi Hendrix: The Guitar Hero 


Classic Artists could not claim to have a complete series on rock legends and their mark on the world of music without this film, the final word on guitar virtuoso Jimi Hendrix. Rather than drudging up scandal and outworn hypothesis about Jimi's lifestyle and ultimate death, this Classic Artists film looks at Hendrix the master of electric guitar, as told by a selection of the world's greatest musicians Jimi Hendrix: The Guitar Hero includes all new and exclusive interviews with Dave Mason (Traffic), Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Eric Burdon (The Animals), Paul Rodgers (Bad Company), Ginger Baker (Cream), Bev Bevan (ELO), Crosby, Stills and Nash and others. Some of these musicians were his mentors, some his contemporaries and some admirers of his incredible talent. Countless musicians have emerged as new talent as a result of his influence, explaining why Hendrix's work remains at the zenith of rock music to this day. Moving beyond the icon and the myth, Classic Artists brings alive the image and music that Jimi Hendrix evoked from his very soul, using the instrument, as, he put it, as his "personal diary." This style evoked a home-grown and raw, uncensored sensuality, which indeed was his nature and that of his music, as if he were his own muse. Narrated by Slash (Guns N Roses, Velvet Revolver) a longtime Hendrix acolyte, this film is less a biography than the first film ever to focus on the music itself and the impetus of the master who created it.
