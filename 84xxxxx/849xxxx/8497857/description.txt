With the long-forgotten rock band The Seeds in the roles of The Warts. 
This is easily one of the worst episodes, which is why NBC aired it 
as the last show of the season.

The late Sky Saxon actually re-started The Seeds in the 1990s with 
a different line-up of musicians. Their last CD in 2004 "Red Planet"
wasn't bad but they were largely going for the band's 1960s retro sound
with 21st century instrumentation.
