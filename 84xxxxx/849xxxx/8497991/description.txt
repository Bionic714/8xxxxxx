Fashionably Late, the second single from 

Ripped from official video on Youtube by Epitaph Records

Encoded as 320kbps MP3

HOWEVER the Youtube sound quality creates a falloff at about 16khz, reducing the effective quality of this song to be about 128kbps. I encoded at 320 simply to make sure everything that could be salvaged from the original rip was.

Just hope to tide some people over until the full album comes out!
