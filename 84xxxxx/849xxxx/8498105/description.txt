A Very Potter Musical (originally titled Harry Potter: The Musical) is a musical with music and lyrics by Darren Criss and A.J. Holmes, and a book by Matt Lang, Nick Lang and Brian Holden. The story is a parody based on several of the Harry Potter novels, and tells the story of Harry Potter's return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the trials and tribulations of adolescence, his participation in the House Cup Championship, and the return of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort to power.
The musical was performed in April 9ΓÇô11, 2009, on the University of Michigan campus and is currently available to watch online. It was produced by StarKid Productions and directed by Matt Lang. The musical starred Darren Criss as Harry Potter, Joey Richter as Ron Weasley, Bonnie Grueson as Hermione Granger, Lauren Lopez as Draco Malfoy, Brian Rosenthal as Quirinus Quirrell, and Joe Walker as Lord Voldemort. In late June 2009, the group put the entire musical up on YouTube, and it became a viral video, obtaining millions of views.

While reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Nick Lang and a few others attending the University of Michigan discussed the possibility of Draco Malfoy having a crush on Hermione Granger because of him constantly bullying her, and created the concept of a song "Granger Danger," which led to the idea of making a Harry Potter musical.[4] When the script was being written, they asked Darren Criss if they could use his songs "Sami," which was originally written for the web series Little White Lie, and "Not Alone" which they ended up using as a model for the show.
