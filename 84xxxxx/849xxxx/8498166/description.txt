Comprehensive collection of excerpts from the full range of Rahner's theology.


description:

No single anthology could hope to capture the full scope of Karl Rahner's thought - his publications numbering over 3,500 separate works in the years between 1924 and 1979 - but this collection is the best that could possibly be devised, containing 174 selections which reflect the best of Rahner's thought from the early 1950s to 1980.

about Karl Rahner:

Karl Rahner, SJ (March 5, 1904 – March 30, 1984) was a German Jesuit and theologian who, alongside Henri de Lubac, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Yves Congar, is considered one of the most influential Roman Catholic theologians of the 20th century. He was the brother of Hugo Rahner.

He was born in Freiburg, Germany, and died in Innsbruck, Austria.

Before the Second Vatican Council, Rahner had worked alongside Yves Congar, Henri de Lubac and Marie-Dominique Chenu, theologians associated with an emerging school of thought called the Nouvelle Théologie, elements of which had been condemned in the encyclical Humani Generis of Pope Pius XII. Subsequently, however, the Second Vatican Council was much influenced by his theology and his ground-breaking understanding of Catholic faith.
