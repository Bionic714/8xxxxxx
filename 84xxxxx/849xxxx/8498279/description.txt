I've compiled these from various Russian sites and removed the Russian audio track. The source files I believe are from iTunes, and even though they are somewhat less sharp compared with other 720p WEB-DLs, these are the best available versions. A fine series, and not widely available, so I hope you keep it alive by seeding after you download!
