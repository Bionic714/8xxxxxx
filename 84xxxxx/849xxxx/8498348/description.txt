History of May '68 and leftist critique of the traditional left.


description:

In May 68 a student protest spread to other universities, to Paris factories and in a few weeks to most of France. A million Parisians marched; ten million workers went out on strike. At the center of the fray was Daniel Cohn-Bendit. Obsolete Communism was written in 5 weeks immediately after the state regained control, and no account of May 68 can match its immediacy or urgency.

The book combines an account of the events of May 1968 with a critique of Stalinism, the French Communist Party and the trade union establishment. It remains available today and has had some lasting influence on anarchist and socialist thought.
