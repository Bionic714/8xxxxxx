From the guy who created the torrent:

I'm missing Pony Swag Too and Equestrian Lover. I tried to find them for free somewhere, but couldn't find them, and I really don't like them much at all. Certainly not enough to merit buying them.

What's left is all of his pony albums that are CC licensed, which only excludes Bass Cannon and Hideyoshi (which are both amazing and I bought and you should too). I also threw in all his album-less songs that I had. Those are definitely not all of his, but are all the ones I like.

I'm sharing these under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike CC license that Silva Hound released them under. If you share these albums, you are required to do so under the same license.

And please seed when you're done. I intend to stop seeding in a week or so's time, and I'd like the torrent to stay alive.
