
For those of you who canΓÇÖt wait for Galaxy S4, you can already get some Galaxy S4 features like the S Translator app on your rooted Galaxy S3 or Galaxy Note 2.

Galaxy S4 S Translator app indeed works pretty well, allows users to translate languages in real-time while traveling.  I can see myself using it if I do travel to countries that the app supports to get around.

S Translator app currently supports 10 languages:  Chinese, UK English, US English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.

So, whatΓÇÖs different from GoogleΓÇÖs own Google Translator app?

The S Translator app is more geared towards using it in real life as it will translate two languages back and forth, with ability to translate spoken language and also ability to speak translated language.

The S Translator interface is certainly a lot better than Google Translator app, allowing you to actually use it in real life, very easy to translate two languages in real-time.
