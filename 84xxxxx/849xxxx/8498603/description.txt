While audible's edition is technically abridged (5 mins missing from chapter 2, footnotes missing and two chapters, 54 & 56, weren't recorded), this is the best full cast recording of the book you'll ever get.

TO MAKE THIS LESS ABRIDGED -- THE MISSING MINUTES/CHAPTERS HAVE BEEN ADDED FROM A DIFFERENT VERSION (read by Jim Zeiger).
The only part missing now are the footnotes. ;)
