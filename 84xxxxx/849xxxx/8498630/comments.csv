After that nothing works anymore, not even trying to re-install from the beginning."

...and why did you try to update Avid Pro Tools...?

Congratulations. Reformat your Hd..."
,Svenson44,2013-05-26T01:35Z,"@mac.the.ripper: my hd is fine, the pro tools updater fails and the original pro tools installation won't work anymore, just did what the instructions said. Also without the update pro tools does not work on 10.7.5."

I am sure your hd is ok and I may be wrong when I adviced you to format your hd. 

But Avid might have uploaded a file on your hd to denie any attemt to reinstall this version of PT. 

If Adobe detects you are using a non legit version of CS - same shit may happen.

I hope the uploder have a better solution. 

My advice is - never update warez if not the uploader tell you its ok."

And your comment is as usual stinking diarrhea. Wipe your oral ass, cocksucker. You are just full of shit."

The may be a problem installing for Svenson44, but the main issue with early versions of Pro Tools (which is anything before 9.0.5) is that they do not run on Lion or Mountain Lion.  The cracks only work on Snow Leopard, and even if the cracks did work on above 10.6.8, when you tried to start pro tools it would force an update. At which point, the crack would no longer be functional. If we really want to see something bragging about, get a version of Pro Tools 9 (9.0.5 or higher) or Pro Tools 10 working for OSX 10.7 or 10.8. Until then, the majority of this is useless.  If you are still running Snow Leopard, then this along with most of the other pro tools 9 torrents for mac will work on your machine."
