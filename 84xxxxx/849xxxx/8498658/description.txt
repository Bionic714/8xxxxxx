It's high adventure, triumph and tragedy as we journey around the world in the wake of one of the greatest explorers of all time - James Cook.
A hero to some, a curse to others, this son of an English farm labourer described more of the globe than any other man in three incredible voyages.
Cook expert and bestselling British author Vanessa Collingridge searches for the man behind the legend as she traces his story in a series that is part biography,
part travelogue - and completely enthralling
