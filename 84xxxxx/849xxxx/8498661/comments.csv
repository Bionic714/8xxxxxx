Ella is still great =)"
,terrenmcconn,2013-05-22T18:39Z,"Sad news!!  I hope you do what soanti said, and continue uploading FG, Ella at least!!  "
,-darkangl-,2013-05-22T21:21Z,The new girl is really cute too.  Looking forward to seeing her.  I'm really sad Virginia retired.  She was wonderful.

Won't know for sure till her sets come up but if she does favor them I am sure it was on purpose lol. I hope she has nipples like Virginia, she could cut glass with those :)"
