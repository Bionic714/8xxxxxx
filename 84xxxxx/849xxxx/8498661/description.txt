"And now the end of near, and so I face the final curtain..."


Beginning next month no more Ginny! She QUITS! So curtains down for me?


Even though a new girl name Keith(!?!?!) will replace Ginny but no Sandra, no Ginny? 

It's not the same anymore... 


Do enjoy Virginia for the next week or so. I did, I do and I will. Sigh...
