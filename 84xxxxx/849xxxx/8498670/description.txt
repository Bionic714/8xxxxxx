Information
------------------------------

Described as "the greatest woman rifle shot the world has ever produced," Annie Oakley thrilled audiences of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show with her daring shooting feats. Over time she became an American legend. But that legend had little to do with the real Annie Oakley. This probing AMERICAN EXPERIENCE production examines the dramatic life of a uniquely American icon whose complex character manifested many of the paradoxes of the nation.
