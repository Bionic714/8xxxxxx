Release Notes:

Beginning with their 1979 Life In A Day album, Glasgow's Simple Minds recorded
some of the most beguiling, inventive, adventurous music of the post-punk period
and set the standard for the British alternative scene with the albums Real to
Real Cacophony (also 1979), Empires and Dance (1980), and the pioneering 'twin'
releases Sons and Fascination / Sister Feelings Call (1981). In 1982, they
recorded the landmark New Gold Dream (81 82 83 84), which served as the template
for U2's The Unforgettable Fire two years later

In 1985, Simple Minds went stratospheric in the U.S. with their No. 1 Billboard
Hot 100 and Mainstream Rock single 'Don't You (Forget About Me),' memorably
featured as the theme to the John Hughes film The Breakfast Club. Later that
year, the band released its most successful album, Once Upon a Time, which
reached the Billboard 200's Top 10 and went gold, fueled by Top 5 Modern Rock
hits 'Alive And Kicking' and 'Sanctify Yourself,' and the Top 10 'All The Things
She Said,' all of which are included on the new ICON collection, as well as a
new song, 'Broken Glass Park.'
