,valaki8,2013-05-23T09:33Z,"It's real. I've been playing since yesterday, lvl 13 so far. Dunno which build tho, and how this will be updated. The exe is just a rar or zip file, you need to extract it and run the grim dawn.exe file afterwards."

,drdoodoo,2013-05-25T07:32Z,"Yes, this is real. FYI, it isn't very exciting at first and the interface is very blah, but the game does get more exciting when the monsters get tougher. The first few levels are a snorefest."
,Delia666,2013-05-25T23:45Z,"Can you please upload Build 10 ?
this is build 9 , 10 is out now >.<

,rewar001,2013-05-26T21:47Z,FAKE! winrar exe that winrar cannot extract lol dumbass
,rewar001,2013-05-26T21:55Z,fake! if it's just a rar archive why can't winrar extract? hmmmmmm
,irishpride1960,2013-05-28T19:22Z,"Thanks LotosYar, works perfectly. AFAIK this is only 1/3 of the actual game, for anyoe interested, as for people saying its fake, they're full of crap.

If you like this alpha build, please consider pre-ordering or buying it here :

,Daorue,2013-05-30T23:10Z,Game works great thanks. Its pretty decent for an alpha. Wish someone could upload some updates though.
,drdoodoo,2013-05-31T00:28Z,"Anyone have the latest patch? I paid for the beta, not the alpha. Is there anyway to convert if I kick in the $20 difference? LOL!"
,shoted45,2013-06-02T09:50Z,"@rewar001 You are the biggest retard I have seen on the internet in a long time. I made an account just to inform you, you should delete utorrent and never try to use another torrent in your life. The program is not a fucking winrar archive. It is a self extracting exe which means its a compressed folder that doesnt need a program to help extract it. It was invented a long time ago so people could share compressed files and not have to worry about the person who receives said file having a program to unzip it."

,washlappen,2013-06-04T02:27Z,"Works great, thx!"
,fish_fingers,2013-06-10T01:44Z,"I bought this game... on kickstarter, in what seems like eons ago. I got a game key for the full release, but this alpha requires a Steam key purchased from the Humble store. So I guess that leaves me out."
