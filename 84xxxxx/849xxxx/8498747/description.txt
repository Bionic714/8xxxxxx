ARPG from Crate Entertainment (Alpha)

Grim Dawn is an action-RPG for the PC currently being developed by veterans of Iron Lore Entertainment, the creators of Titan Quest. The game is set in a thematically-dark fictional world loosely inspired by the Victorian Era on earth. Grim Dawn is being developed with the same tools and technology used to create Titan Quest. As a spiritual successor to Titan Quest, Grim Dawn will carry forward the best gameplay of this genre while bringing a few focused innovations and improvements of our own to the table.
