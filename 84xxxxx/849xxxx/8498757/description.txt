SYNOPSIS

In a small cabin on the edge of a park, a group of friends gather for fun. But when they come across a mysterious book, and of course despite all warnings read aloud from it, they unwittingly unleash a ghostly evil. The book resurrects whacked out redneck Leo DeChamp, a serial killer who used to strangle kids with skunk tails in the 1960's. Leo has returned to terrorize all with his unique brand of ""redneckian"" villainy, and to claim more young, nubile (and downright not so nubile) victims.
