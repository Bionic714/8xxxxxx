,Lalaz4,2013-05-23T04:31Z,Wow! Pretty quick to get here. Thanks!
,Andrezado,2013-05-26T04:27Z,1.2.1 came out. Release a patch please.
,Andrezado,2013-05-27T02:50Z,Please an update? There is a glitch in-game that makes it almost unplayable in long-term game time!
,Catwalker86,2013-06-08T13:00Z,"Hope someone gets the 1.2.1 soon.
1.2 - The archers won't fire from walls/towers, disappointment -.- 

I will pay for the game when it's ""more playable"" for now i wait and see where the game is heading with the updates. I did my mistake to buy Minecraft in the early stages. It was great with survival-skills, i hopped factors like ""thirst"", ""overheat"", ""sickness"" medical plants etc. was going to come but NO!!! Let's make an Oblivion copy instead with scrolls, magic and enchantments... -.- Then i stopped play the game..."
