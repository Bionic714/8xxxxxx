Delta Force: A Memoir by the Founder of the Military's Most Secretive Special-Operations Unit
by Charlie A. Beckwith, Donald Knox

DESCRIPTION:

A word of caution to people who are considering reading this book. The book tells of how Delta Force was formed...from its beginnings as a US version of the British SAS to its failed first mission freeing the hostages in the Iran. If you're looking for something on what Delta Force currently does and how its operators are currently trained or selected, this isn't the book for you. Beckwith tells us how the first Delta operators were trained and selected, but that selection process has probably changed some by now.
