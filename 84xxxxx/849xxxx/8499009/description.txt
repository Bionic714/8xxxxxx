Wednesday 05-22-2013: Henry Winkler - Actor (First broadcast March 5. 2013)

HARDtalk speaks to an actor whose long career will always be defined by one role. Henry Winkler was the Fonz, the cool dude at the centre of the US TV show Happy Days which was a worldwide hit in the 70s and 80s. The show portrayed an innocent, untroubled 1950s America. It was a far cry from Winkler's own childhood which was clouded by undiagnosed dyslexia. How did a troubled kid come to be a symbol of sunny optimism, and what happened to the idealised America of Happy Days?
