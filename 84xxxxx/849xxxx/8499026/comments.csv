If you want SATA Drivers, make a request, and he will make a release with your motherboards SATA Drivers and he can fix the remote desktop bugg=D He have done that private to me ;D"
,viggen6666,2013-05-23T00:28Z,I reckon this must be Ultrasaurus's ISO with Sata drivers
,viggen6666,2013-05-23T00:48Z,"But XP Home always requires activation, is not like Pro with Volume"
,Antraxy,2013-05-23T14:05Z,"Warring:
Remote Desktop Connection is not working on this Windows XP."
,edcba,2013-05-25T12:18Z,"@OnlyByTheRain - thanks for sharing, well maybe this doesn't need to activate, but in the middle of installation you are forced to enter a valid serial number - and your both serials in Serial.txt doesn't work. So I was forced to hard reboot the PC and reinstall my old xp+sp1 instead. I really like to install this, but do you know about some functional keygen?

(Btw, i really wonder how does Microsoft validate entered keys? Some CDiscs prompts you to enter a serial on a green sticker, another on a yellow one.)"

,viggen6666,2013-05-27T20:22Z,"You don't need to insert any key, just skip on the setup and run the wpa tool, anyways has Antraxy said, does this XP home has the remote desktop bug?"
,edcba,2013-06-01T21:53Z,"Thanks pals for your help, all works well! Now i tried to install it on VirtualBox and it only needed to leave all fields for product key empty, then the installer allows you to continue with the installation. Greetings :-)"
,Boujisan,2013-06-07T06:26Z,Are we sure this is an OEM? I've been using OEM versions for years now and should always allow you to use the key on the side of the case and not need to use any anti.
