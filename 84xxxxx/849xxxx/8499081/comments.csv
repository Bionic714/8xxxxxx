Yours and all of publicHDs iTunes sourced web-dls play on my media player but when I download from iTunes myself I can't get them to play. Won't play as the original mp4 file, won't play if I use mkvmerge, Handbrake loses quality so I do not know what else to try."

Sorry for being late but I rarely check back my releases. Let me know if you need help or have questions. Best thing is to post on my last uploaded torrent (eg here https://thepiratebay.sx/user/-Gabe-/ )

Would be great to share your web itunes movies here  :)"
