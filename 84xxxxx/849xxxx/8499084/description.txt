Gray Matters: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind
Sanford Goldberg (Author), Andrew Pessin (Author)



In Gray Matters Goldberg and Pessin provide a clearly written introduction to the philosophy of mind presupposing no prior knowledge of philosophy. The first two chapters introduce and examine the traditional positions on the "mind-body" problem; the middle three chapters turn to the issues which largely defined the philosophy of mind for the last several decades of the twentieth century; and the final chapter surveys the fundamental issues concerning consciousness which largely define the philosophy of mind today. The book's much needed organization and codification of work in the field will be useful to advanced students as well.
