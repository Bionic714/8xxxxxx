The Forbidden Universe: The Occult Origins of Science and the Search for the Mind of God
Lynn Picknett (Author), Clive Prince (Author)


From the bestselling and controversial writers who inspired The Da Vinci Code comes the latest in scientific and religious conspiracies.
Secret societies, famous scientists, ancient Egyptian mysticism, and a fascinating addition to the god-versus-science debate: the Catholic Church. By the bestselling authors of The Templar Revelation and Mary Magdalene, The Forbidden Universe reveals how the foundations of modern science were based around a desire to destroy the church. The great pioneering scientists of the Renaissance and the early Enlightenment (including Copernicus, Galileo, and Sir Isaac Newton) were fervent devotees of the philosophical/mystical system of Hermeticism. Many of the most important scientists of this age, including Galileo, belonged to a secret society called the Giordanisti, which had the agenda to overthrow the Church and establish a new age of Hermetic supremacy.
