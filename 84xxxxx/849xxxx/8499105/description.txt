What Can I Do?

Scout Niblett's latest album opens with a murder ballad, "Gun", which reveals its call-to-vengeance line-by-line. It begins uninnocently enough, arming up, then moving to intent, and finally motive: "Maybe you'll be holding her hand/ Or watching her shitty band," she snarls, drawing out "band" in a way that displays the full plumage of her disgust. She strums slowly, unfancily, as she recounts a lover's bed-hopping betrayal. Then there's the shot-- "HA!" and a grunge-glorious bridge with the big reveal, "She took your love away from me/ And I am thankful." She wants him back as much as she wants him gone.
