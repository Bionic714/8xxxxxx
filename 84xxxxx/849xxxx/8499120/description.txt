Liz Lawrence sings subtly effective folk music, accompanied with acoustic backing band. This album was made for putting on in bed in the morning.

She contends with the human condition; growing up, painting the future as observed from the past and falling / being in love. The tracks alternate between upbeat anthems and down-tempo moodiness. They are modestly soul searching, inspired by the plain and simple.
