,nox234558,2013-05-22T20:39Z,can u upload call of juarez gunslinger the others one are really slow speed :/
,Slayer676,2013-05-22T21:06Z,This is the full version that was released today and not the demo right ?
,LRN,2013-05-22T21:08Z,"TheTorrentter, the description states that crack is not required (as you may have guessed, the description was not in English originally, it's translated).

Can't say if that assertion is correct or not."
,Dimmis80,2013-05-22T21:55Z,Hey HeroMaster mate.Congrats for this release.I have a question.!In steam site it says that u need 20 GB to install the game and there is an another torrent that its 18 GB.!So when u install the game does it open and became 18-20 GB and stuff.?Any confirmation from u or from another person who tried this it would be fine..??
,Suenami,2013-05-22T22:55Z,"This game is 20GB big . Why dont u buy it guys ,it`s only 13.49 on Steam and its brilliant !!!!"
,s1raz1,2013-05-22T23:18Z,Thank you HeroMaster :D +1
,Slayer676,2013-05-23T09:13Z,"Thank you, it works great. Just install and play :)"
,ffhighwind,2013-05-23T22:55Z,"Installer starts in Russian but can swap to English. It asks to install to steam/common, which is a little shady. I installed somewhere else and can't get multi-player or online working, not that that's a surprise."
,christianDCC,2013-06-02T10:37Z,It crashes when warping to the old town. Did any one else encounter this?
