You have to use steam_api.dll and steam_rld.ini(!) from another game (i used from dead island riptide, from metro last light works too). Then you have to copy AppId number from steam_api.ini included in this release and paste it in proper place in steam_rld.ini (otherwise game works but only as demo). You can change language as usually. For problem with shadows quality change, use reg fix Okyra posted. Game runs for me with no problem. Hope it helped. Cheers"

You're right.  Alot of the people complaining about their slow speeds are falling victim to their own client or client settings.  Rather than ever trying to experiment and fix it..they find it more useful to post comments telling people to ""seed moar"", not even understanding fully the differences between a seed and a peer.  Thx for the info (it's not spam I checked)."
,aoxo,2013-05-25T07:28Z,"People having errors related to any file containing the letters DX....This is Direct X.  If it's missing a file called ""d3dx9..."", then you're missing Direct X 9.0c.  Windows 7 ships with DX11, not with DX9..but you can and should still install DX9 since not all games will support DX11.  Hop on the google and look for dxwebsetup.exe from microsoft, this will install 9.0c and all the updates to it."

,unreadable33,2013-05-27T16:05Z,"TO EVERYONE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH LOW FPS RATE. 

Here's a fix that brought me from 10-15 fps up to around 60. It's not your hardware, its a bug that Ubisoft is trying to patch. Until then, try this.

1. Enter the Ease of access center which can be accessed through Accessories after clicking Start.
2.Once, you are there, click ‘Make the Keyboard Easier to use’.
3. Click ‘Turn on Repeat Keys and Slow Keys’,and then on ‘Set up Repeat Keys and Slow Keys’.
4. Select the “ignore all repeated keys” option and reduce the time to 0.0 mentioned in the box. 
5. Make sure that ‘Turn on Filter Keys’ is ticked at the top of the panel.
6.Apply the changes and see if the stutter goes away with it.

Hope this helps. This fix made the game so much more enjoyable for me.
