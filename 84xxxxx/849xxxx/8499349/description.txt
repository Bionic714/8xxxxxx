Book Description:
Opening with an informative introduction to the history of Spain, Pepita Aris describes the country's food and cooking styles. She looks at the traditional eating habits, the social customs and the festivals and celebrations that have provided the inspiration for so many of Spain's regional dishes. You will find an essential guide to the ingredients used in the Spanish kitchen, including advice on buying, storing and preparation. This section also includes details about the equipment and techniques employed. The heart of the book is the recipe collection, comprising over 75 classic and regional dishes. This focuses on traditional Spanish home cooking from hearty stews to sumptuous desserts, with chapters on tasty soups, healthy salads and vegetable dishes, rice and pasta dishes, fresh fish and shellfish, and delicious regional meat and poultry dishes, including classic recipes such as Cocido from Madrid, Valencian Paella and creamy Crema Catalana. This beautifully photographed book captures the real flavour of Spain and is irresistible for anyone who loves good Mediterranean food. Pepita Atis is an authority on Spanish food and this is her sixth book on the subject. She has spent a great deal of time in Spain over the years and writes on Spain for a number of newspapers and magazines.
