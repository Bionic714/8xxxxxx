The word NURU in Japanese means "slippery".
The Nuru Massage uses a special gel which is made from deep seaweed and is 
colourless, tastless, and extremely slippery and smooth.
The masseuse will rub your entire body with the nuru nuru and slide on you from 
all imaginable angles for a perfect body to body massage.
