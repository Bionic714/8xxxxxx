These are two replacement texture files to enhance your Imaginesim KLGA scenery. Simply drop them into the texture folder. Readme for more information.

Enhancements in this version,

Taxi and Runway Sings are brightened to appear more realistic. The defaults are too dark.

Taxiway edge lights/blue lights have been modified to appear a more bright blue and the effect
is pretty good, as you get closer to them, they appear to get a brigher blue/white.

Comments welcome. Enjoy, more to come.
