a real shame ."
,Clasique,2013-05-24T22:47Z,"I installed it and done everything I need to do. Then, when I try to launch it, I get this message:  http://screenshotr.net/images/ScreenShotr519fd0949fd448.23783261.png

I have steam installed, so I don't know what the problem is. Please help."
,tfox71,2013-05-25T00:15Z,"The game crashes after 10-15 minutes of play, sometimes i get the message ""Display driver stopped responding and has recovered"". I have Geforce 9600Gt 512mb and i play all games without any problem, can someone help me? "
,Saitekman,2013-05-25T03:14Z,"First thank you extremezone.

I am not sure why so many people download things off of PB yet they never come back and post how easy it was to install and how well the download and games work. All  you ever see on here is people complaining about how people need to seed and tons of people having issues.

The download was perfect, I downloaded the torrent at 2.5mb/sec and it installed flawlessly as per instructions. The game itself is actually pretty good.

I will continue to seed over night. 

Thanks again!"
,divinedawg96,2013-05-25T04:25Z,"I cant get it to work! I keep getting ""Application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142)"".
Help?"
,CADETbrazil,2013-05-25T05:43Z,"Works well... This game is only ""shoot them all"", still missing the first game with the indian boy."

U R right, the first part was the best in my opinion. "

,zfusk,2013-05-26T01:43Z,im also having audio scratching sound. any fix?
,slasher.boy,2013-05-26T16:32Z,hey when I start the game it goes to the steam community page of the game. How do I solve this? 
,MadRevolver,2013-05-27T04:48Z,The audio scratching sound usually occurs on single core cpus with no hyperthreading. Thanks for the up! I like this game.
,Goku1503,2013-05-27T09:51Z,"I heard that when YOU are ending instalation and you are about to begin to play, you are getting an error and all is just fucked up. All games from Stiffmeister have this problem. If it will be here, people will need a help, not from others, from extreme."
,MadRevolver,2013-05-27T11:44Z,@Goku1503: all the games I tested from stiff are fine. and is different to hear things than test them yourself.
,0101neo0101,2013-05-27T13:43Z,"My game doesn't save ""history mode"" progress. Secrets keep discovered and ""arcade mode"" progress is saved, but not History one.
¿?¿?¿?
Is it because of the registri or crack issue??
Anuybody help?"
,divinedawg96,2013-05-27T14:04Z,"Anyone having the same error as me. ""Application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142)"". I cant find any solution to this problem. Please help?"
,unreadable33,2013-05-27T16:09Z,"TO EVERYONE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH LOW FPS RATE. 

 Here's a fix that brought me from 10-15 fps up to around 60. It's not your hardware, its a bug that Ubisoft is trying to patch. Until then, try this.

 1. Enter the Ease of access center which can be accessed through Accessories after clicking Start.
 2.Once, you are there, click ‘Make the Keyboard Easier to use’.
 3. Click ‘Turn on Repeat Keys and Slow Keys’,and then on ‘Set up Repeat Keys and Slow Keys’.
 4. Select the “ignore all repeated keys” option and reduce the time to 0.0 mentioned in the box. 
 5. Make sure that ‘Turn on Filter Keys’ is ticked at the top of the panel.
 6.Apply the changes and see if the stutter goes away with it.

 Hope this helps. This fix made the game so much more enjoyable for me."

,bobtiker,2013-05-29T07:04Z,"So I downloaded everything, applied the crack and the icon shows up on my desktop. When I click on it, I get a message that says ""cannot write in game folder. You don't have write permission.""

I also tried opening it through the downloaded folder and opening it from their but the same thing comes up. I then changed my permission under the security tab to full permission but the thing still comes up. Please help."
,bobtiker,2013-05-29T07:08Z,"I have a solution if anyone had the same problem. 

All you need to do is

1)Go to the spot you downloaded the game to (ie: program files/call of juarez gunslinger. etc)
2)Click on properties of that folder
3)Go to security tab
4)Hit advanced
5)Change the settings to full control
6)Play game"

,MrHaints,2013-06-03T07:42Z,"For EVERYONE getting a ""0xc0000142"" error like divinedawg96 and dayforme ...

I'm guessing you have XP like me. There is a problem with the newer steam cracks and XP in that they don't work.

The solution is to use a slightly older steam crack. I used the following files from Metro Last Light and they worked just fine with Gunslinger.

steam_api.dll
steam_api.ini
steam_appid.txt
steam_rld.ini

I haven't downloaded Metro I'm assuming you could just use one of the cracks for it ...

Good luck."
,MrHaints,2013-06-03T07:44Z,"Sorry, that last part was supposed to read: ""If you haven't downloaded Metro, I'm assuming you could just use one of the cracks for it ..."""
