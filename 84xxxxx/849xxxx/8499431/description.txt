IMD description

Near the end of the French phase of the Vietnam War, a group of mercenaries are recruited to travel through enemy territory to the Chinese border, to blow up an arms depot. A Eurasian smuggler, Lucky Legs, agrees to use her connections to help them, in return getting her bastard son into America. The racist father of the boy, Sergeant Brock, is also part of the multinational group. Lucky Legs must use the love of a Eurasian guerilla leader, Major Cham, to get access to the base.  by Peter Reiher  [edited for spoiler content]


Thanks Peter


My notes

  Another film I have not seen listed in torrents which has come into availability recently.
For Samuel Fuller 'completitists'.  Given in gratitude to the torrent community, however I am not particularly fond of war stories.  It is interesting in that Fuller chose the Indo Chinese war in Vietnam conducted by the French in their Foreign Legion.

Nat King Cole makes an unusual appearance in a featured role as one of the mercenaries in this film and sings the theme song.
