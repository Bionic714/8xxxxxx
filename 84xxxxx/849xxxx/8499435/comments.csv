,piratebuddha,2013-05-23T00:59Z,"Thank you! I actually bought this Blu-ray, it's the first physical film I've felt was worth buying in over a year, but I'm downloading this to have a HD portable copy.

This film is very ambitious, it's not perfect, but it really is worth watching and the effort made to film and release this film is very inspirational."
,ofpirate,2013-05-24T00:21Z,extremely ambitious film.. the kind of film you really need to see twice - totally worth it though!
