# # Comments: Put on your wide-brimmed hat, grab your weapons and embark on an

incredible adventure in the gothic-noir world of Borgovia, where mad science threatens the fragile peace between monster and mortal. Be Van Helsing,

monster-hunter extraordinaire and save the day with your charming and beautiful companion, Lady Katarina (who happens to be a ghost, by the way).

Explore the savage wilderness in the mountains and the soot-stained brick districts of a grim metropolis twisted by weird science, and don't forget:

you might never know who the real monsters are!
