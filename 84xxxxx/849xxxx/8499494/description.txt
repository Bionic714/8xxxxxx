Dubbed by BarronΓÇÖs as ΓÇ£The Shadow CIA,ΓÇ¥ George FriedmanΓÇÖs global intelligence company, Stratfor, has provided analysis to Fortune 500 companies, news outlets, and even the U.S. government. Now Friedman delivers the geopolitical story that the mainstream media has been unable to uncover ΓÇö the startling truth behind AmericaΓÇÖs foreign policy and war effort in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond.
