,zitorix,2013-05-23T14:41Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!

Don't bother downloading, you'll just get this error:

""The application has failed to start because the side by side configuration is incorrect please see the application event log or use the command line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail""

I tried all the solutions for this specific error, none of them work. Nor do I get this error for anything else.

DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"
,Bunnuh,2013-05-23T16:14Z,"Don't listen to Zitorix. :| Playing it right now and it works fine for me, he just has something wrong with his which he needs to solve."
,Ixshil,2013-05-23T16:23Z,"***WORKS PERFECTLY***

Zitorix, Did you install the required MISSING redistributables?

This game requires the 3rd one on this list http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26347

,Dllfile,2013-05-23T23:33Z,"@zitorix sounds like a missing runtime of some sort. Side by Side is a generic Window Vista/7/8 error that means it cannot find something required for the software to run properly. Most commonly it is usually a specific build of Visual Basic/CRT/ATL.. but could also be DX Builds, .NET etc.."
,Oracle1990,2013-05-24T10:28Z,"DIP! (I downloaded it, installed it, played it.) No problems."
,Dllfile,2013-05-24T11:25Z,"Visual C* - just woke up, realized I put VB but whatever - point made. Game works at any rate :)"
,CMS93,2013-05-25T08:24Z,"@zitorix

that's because you didn't install it correctly. you shouldn't be talking shit for nothing man."
,DaTaicho,2013-05-26T02:44Z,anybody else have trouble copying over the steam_api.dll file?
,acegikmoq,2013-05-26T23:02Z,The files in the torrent does not include a crack folder. Did this happen to anyone else?
,tketch,2013-05-28T16:56Z,"The crack is located on the image.

I downloaded from another tracker, but I'm getting a 142 error (application failed to start) even after downloading and installing all the right redistributables (which didn't require [re]installing in the first place)."
,noekk,2013-05-28T21:53Z,Reloaded's steam_api.dll is being knocked out by Windows Defender. I don't know about this group anymore.
,thraxx_capiz,2013-05-29T07:53Z,"its working but i don't like the game its kind of boring, just my opinion. works perfectly just follow instruction."
,TheRad,2013-05-31T08:26Z,"Curious what the steam files are for? Works great!
Could anyone help me with my question though"
,madroxDupe,2013-05-31T12:09Z,"good relase works greate ! Thanks RELOADED !!!

,W-olf,2013-06-06T08:20Z,"Game keeps crashing mid game, when you autoload it crashes again... Shit they need to fix this.. "
,Random20,2013-06-07T03:06Z,"This download and install works perfectly. Thanks again for the upload.

I think a patch or two for this got released on steam. I could be mixing this up with the plain old Fallen Enchantress though. Anyone got a link to a patch and crack that we can use for Legendary Heroes?"
,timrath,2013-06-13T01:03Z,Did anyone get this to run with WinXP? I keep getting a 0xc0000142 error.
,Flawlessjess,2013-06-14T09:00Z,"Hes not the only one having errors windows 7 latest drivers for everything i get  ""legendary heroes unable to start correctly 0xc00000022"" first time i have had an issue with any game from reloaded."
