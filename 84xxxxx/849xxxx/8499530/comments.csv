,11western,2013-05-26T01:57Z,"Sounds good, will d/l and report."
,11western,2013-05-26T03:26Z,Just started watching the movies so don't know how good it is but the a/v is 10/10
,11western,2013-05-26T05:27Z,"OK , decent movie, could've been a little longer to make a better ending ( kind of leaves u hanging ) but a well written movie and acting was good too.

 Dark scenes in the forest were a little pixeled but only a minute or so. Other then that good."
