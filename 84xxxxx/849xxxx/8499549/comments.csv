[T],_SnakEye,2013-05-25T12:41Z,"VoxATC is actually the best offline ATC out there, I purchased it about two years ago, used it a lot until I discovered Flying with VATSIM is better :)

VoxATC is the best (i reviewed also RC and PFE)"
[T],_SnakEye,2013-05-25T14:41Z,"* VoxATC is the only ATC program that also fully Controls your AI traffic including your plane.
all the others just control your plane taking in consideration the AI traffic that is there, but don't really control them.

*VoxATC also is the only ATC that would used SID & STAR and would assign it automatically during clearance based on your flight plan and RWY in use (based on the weather).
You don't need to file and SID / STAR, the ATC would automatically assign you one.
and the sweet part is, it uses the AIRAC by navigraph for SID/STAR and air routes, so it is always most up to date.

there are many more VoxATC is greater then the others, to long to post it here
but you could find those on AVSIM VoxATC forum.

,WCrashdiveD,2013-05-25T19:47Z,Awesome! Thanx a bunch
,xnolunchx,2013-05-31T00:24Z,Maybe someone could take a look at Radar Contact V4.3?
,PFunk499,2013-06-04T18:17Z,"There's already a torrent out there for RCv4. Its a bit of a bitch to crack, though I figured it out. You gotta read the comments carefully as thats where you get the 411 on cracking it. Harder than most.

RCv4 is good. There was supposed to be a v5 coming but the guy who's making it apparently has stopped because of illness or something. Its a shame because allegedly the new RC was gonna add things like SID/STAR assignment which RCv4 just cannot do.

I'm gonna give this a try and see how it is.

BTW anybody know how to update the AIRAC in this thing? I read on one site something about using the LevelD Airac from Navigraph. Does VoxATC not have a dedicated AIRAC file from Navigraph?"
,PFunk499,2013-06-05T21:21Z,"Okay, I haven't been able to get this program to work. I'm having a problem lots of people say they have. The controller doesn't reply to me, but does to other AI aircraft.

This was supposedly a bug from the last version, but it seems to be persisting here. I can't find any mention of a solution, so I'm not sure exactly what to do.

This would have ended up on my short list of things to buy, but this might kill it. Gonna reinstall and try again."
