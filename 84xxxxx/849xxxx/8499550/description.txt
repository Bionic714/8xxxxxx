If you were to ask yourself, what kind of bible commentary would be used by those radical nuns the Vatican hates so much? -- the answer would be: this one. Also used by other lefty Christians of all stripes. This is a pretty great book.


description:


Since its publication in 1988, Binding the Strong Man has been widely recognized as a landmark in contemporary biblical criticism. Applying a multidisciplinary approach called "socio-literary method," Myers integrates literary criticism, socio-historical exegesis, and political hermeneutics in his investigation of Mark as a "manifesto of radical discipleship."
