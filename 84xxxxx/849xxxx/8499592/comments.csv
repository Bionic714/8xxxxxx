,mercs215,2013-05-22T23:13Z,devs didn't compress any cutscense etc. i heard as no one would buy a AAA game that is only 1gb.... /shrug
[V],globeplus,2013-05-22T23:22Z,"To ronald059: Hi wherever you are and yes , i understand your surprise somehow about the final size but on this game that was possible , many other games with heavy archives it is not possible successfully this kind of work but when it is possible i do my best possible work , on this case great precompression of the algorythms of the games files , nice and carefull work with type of files that it is possible to work and only 1 audio language besides that are 8 languages subtitled letted me doing this positive ripping work where the user only needs to run a less than 15 minutes code work to get the game ready and kicking after that , basically what anyone can expect from a rip file where all the essencial gameplay is keeped and the file size less as possible  and then more hard disc free space on the computer with all the playability available anyway , i am no doubt a great fan of nice ripping work and when i get the job done successfully i always get happy with that ... i hope all of the downloaders of this game file enjoy the ripping work and happy game to all of you ... see you all around here at piratebay ...

[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T14:36Z,"To extract an arc extension archive use the freeware FREEARC as is mentioned on the MUSTREAD.txt inside the file but for fun i have a particular special tool with a little music designed for the extraction of the arc files , i called this tool GlobARC extractor Autorun and you open the tool folder and deposit the arc archive then launch the tool executable and click on the start extraction button then is waiting for the extraction be done but please after the extraction put back the arc archive on the game folder for seeding ... thank you ... ok this tool have 5.1 MB and the link is :

,wellThen,2013-05-23T16:52Z,"Where are the saves stored? 
I need to delete them because the first time I started it I did not change the local settings and the game (starting in my native language) closed because it needed sound files not present in this release. Now every time the save is loaded it switches to my native language instead of english."
,Alexsoteam,2013-05-23T17:53Z,"Yeah i have the same problem of ""wellThen"" how i can change the local settings becasue, in my pc have the staring native lenguage, how i can change it D: Help please"
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T17:54Z,"Hi there and file have all the videos and the work is correct , not infuenciating in anyway the view of the videos , they look very normal on the game , so don´t be borred or upset with things like that , just concentrate in play the game better as possible , the general users must start have in mind that for rips what really counts is all the gameplay for less size possible , if wanted all the game in great style get originals files but with much more size on the computer hard disc and please trust the good sense of the ripper avaliation for the mentionated type of files because i can guarantee you without any demagogy that for me it is more than ok play with this rip all the game no doubt and to wellThen user try appdataLocalCAPCOMRESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS .

Bye for now and enjoy playing rips ... what it matters is all the gameplay available for less size as possible , for repackings or originals are many files around ... see all of you around here ...   "
,wellThen,2013-05-23T18:36Z,"@globeplus In that folder there's just a config file, even if I delete it it keeps loading a save from somewhere else and switches to my native language, hence crashing."
,Alexsoteam,2013-05-23T18:50Z,"@globeplus Yeah i have the same problem my native lenguage is spanish and when i try to open it crashes in the game start indicating ""ESP"" sound problem, i check the config of ""steam_rld"" and it´s in english but idk, why change it to my native lenguage"
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T19:21Z,"To wellThen : you already getted a real saved position inside the game ? it is supposed to the save be located on the mentionated folder and my Globarc extractor autorun works anyway but it is from 2010 , place the folder with the extractor on the desktop ."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T19:33Z,"To Alexsoteam : spanish audio not available , only English , subtitles is ok , you can play with spanish subtitles in english audio , contingences from games rips i guess ... happy game ..."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T19:59Z,"To wellThen : you right about the save file , i don´t find him easily besides that works great inside the game , the supposed location was the general config folder if you understand what i mean but the save location is somewhere else ... where it will be the god damn save on the computer ? A candy offer to who finds out the save location ... see you ..."
,wellThen,2013-05-23T20:07Z,"@globeplus

Here's what happened:
I started the game the first time when my regional format was in italian (that's my native language) and the game text was indeed in italian. I started the game, it prompted me to create a save anda when the game was supposed to load it crashed because it searched an italian audio file (as you can see here: http://i.imgur.com/9S4hknc.jpg).
I checked steam_rld.ini and the language was set to english.

So I changed the regional format to ""english"" in Windows settings and after this the game started with english text until I pressed ""Start"" in the title menu, the game loaded that save game that was created before and switched back to italian, giving that error prompt again.

The only thing inside AppDataLocalCAPCOMRESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS is a config.ini file that does not reset the language to english if I delete it, there's no save whatsoever.

Alexsoteam is having the same issue, the only thing different is that he's spanish and I'm italian.


Anyway, I didn't get the ""Globarc extractor"" part, what did you mean?"
,wellThen,2013-05-23T20:09Z,"Didn't see your last comment before posting.
Well, I also tried to disinstall and reinstall the game but the save didn't get deleted so it obviously isn't into the main game folder."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T20:30Z,"HI !!! CANDY HERE !!! the save location is at ProgramData Steam RLD! and the number of the folder is 210770 and it the DATA0 dat file at the storage folder , i hope you get the location fine , you need to have all your folders showed up on the computer , if don´t go to the control panel - folders options and select show all the occult folders , and the Globarc is a tool that i made for arc files extraction and have a little music during the extraction , it´s a fun tool for arc files extraction ... see you ..."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T20:35Z,"Hi again and please everyone i will say one more time for no one have any doubt about this particular subject : the only audio available it is English , any other audio language will not work properly but all the subtitles languages will work fine with the English audio , so change the Visualisation language on the game options menu if wanted but not the audio language that must be English ... happy game to all of you ..."
,wellThen,2013-05-23T20:37Z,"Fucking found it, guys.

It's the RLD! folder in C:ProgramDataSteam
After you start it you can change the text language from the main menu.

(ProgramData is a hidden folder)"
,wellThen,2013-05-23T20:39Z,"lol, these comments take too much time to update."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T21:08Z,"To wellThen : we both found out the save location , happy game to you but the audio must be English , only change italian for the subtitles on the Visualization languages at the languages at the Options menu of the game and you will play with italian subtitles in english audio ... see you ... "
[V],globeplus,2013-05-23T21:26Z,"Hi and this comment is to say the subtitles languages available to play this game : ENGLISH , FRENCH , GERMAN , ITALIAN , SPANISH , NEDERLANDS , RUSSIAN , POLSKI , PORTUGUESE , BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE AND JAPANESE , all available at the options menu but the VOICE must be English , got it ? ok , happy game to all of you ..."
,gdrive69,2013-05-23T23:00Z,Every time i get to the main screen it crashes.
,jkg55,2013-05-24T04:30Z,heyy dude can u please tell us guys are u working on new games to make good rips as i appreciate your work on these kind of game but more upcoming games like vanhelsing metro etc... having more size problem are difficult for me to keep on my hdd...........so can u tell us......thanx in advance
[V],globeplus,2013-05-24T10:58Z,"To jkg55 : hi for you wherever you are and you welcome to this comments , unfornatly my friend some games like the ones you mentioned have real heavy archives with almost no compression ratio what difficults a lot any work trying for this kind of ripping files , many times i search mod tools for example for this new heavy archives but not even that it is available with normality for fans modding what turns almost impossible anything , on this days we have to be resignated to work only a few games that it is possible with some carefull work doing a nice rip file but just that , i always get frustated myself with games that the work is not possible but i have to accept that and the way is pray for games that it is possible the work , it is like that , this guys from the software houses are always inventing or using new type of archives with a strange bullshit extension if you permit the expression and they don´t give modding tools for this new type of archives turning any type of work for this kind of files almost impossible ... see you and thank you for your comment and to gdrive69 : extract the game again or something because that don´t make sense to happen , it is something unusual wrong with that and it comes to you find out what it is ...
happy games to all of you ."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-24T20:20Z,"Hi again and as i promise in this file comments that when i got the time i maked a new ARC extractor tool more recent , so i did it and the new version is more lighter than ever and work with Drag and Drop of the ARC archive on a prepared executable , the use is very simple , the ARC archive must be moved inside the Drag and Drop Extractor folder then be dragged and dropped at the executable and the ARC archive extraction will begin giving the extracted archive on the same folder , please don´t forget to move the arc archive back to the file folder for seeding ... thank you and have fun ...

[V],globeplus,2013-05-24T21:02Z,"This comment it is for news from the Globe Laboratory on the new GlobARC Drag and Drop Extractor and the news are : NOW the needed files for extraction are combined in a single executable that make the arc extraction and work in drag and drop style WHEREVER you have the ARC archive , for example you drag and drop the arc archive from the game folder on the tool and the archive will be extracted inside the game folder immediatly and will only stop at the end of the arc extraction work , got it ? while the arc extraction is going a small globarc executable is launched on the folder of the extraction and that gives to the user the indication that the extraction is going because when the extraction work is finished this little globarc executable that helps doing the work will disappear from the folder giving the user the sense that the extraction is finished after that and can open the extracted archive folder after that , more easy and pratical for a Drag and Drop Extractor is impossible and the user have all the time easily the indication of the extraction is going because the presence of the small executable during the extraction work and knows that it is finished when this executable disappears from the extraction folder ... like i said this time this tool is a real Drag and Drop executable wherever the ARC archive is ... i think i get the perfect ARC extraction tool , i can´t see any improve after this ... see all of you and i will put a link to the new perfect Globarc Drag and Drop Extractor soon ...
