Daft Punk's new album Random Access Memories finds them leaving behind the highly influential, riff-heavy EDM they originated to luxuriate in the sounds, styles, and production techniques of the 1970s and early 80s. The strengths of Random Access Memories are so notable that youΓÇÖll forget the YouTube interviews with the collaborators, youΓÇÖll forget the day they announced the suits, youΓÇÖll forget the day the ΓÇ£Get LuckyΓÇ¥ snippet leaked, youΓÇÖll forget every rumor, youΓÇÖll forget the ΓÇ£SNLΓÇ¥ commercials. The record will remain something that draws from the past but sounds like little else right now, an album about rediscovery that's situated in the constantly-shifting present.
