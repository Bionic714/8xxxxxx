,Skankky,2013-05-23T21:11Z,I thought that ill love this game... but wtf is going on with optimization? I mean i can play Metro or anything at least on low-med settings... but here.. graphics looks like from 2006 (low-medium sett.) and i cant play it on reasonable fps o.O just dissapointment this game i dont get where the hell all my performance goes when it looks like this..
,Jeffbk1,2013-05-24T00:13Z,Anybody can tell  if multiplayer works?
,drdoodoo,2013-05-24T00:27Z,"Thanks! What's going on with the torrent though? It's downloading EXTREMELY slow. I can usually pull this size down in a few hrs, and with this torrent it's been over a day already."
,pcbflare,2013-05-24T03:51Z,"VanHelsing_x86.exe - Application Error The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000142). Click on OK to terminate the application.   It won't run at all.   I'm pretty pissed. It's the second RLD game that does that. The exactly same thing is happening with Anomaly 2.   I think it has something to do with steam_api.dll. I tried pretty much everything short of reinstalling the system (vcredist, dx reinstall, drivers reinstall, even codecs). I got 32bit winXP - although it's prehistoric system, this game is supposed to work on XP. I play other recent games without problems."
,NetBlaise,2013-05-24T04:40Z,Well I'm installin the game now....  It took forever to download for some reason.. Sometimes it would download at 3meg and it would drop to 800.. Took forever to download....  Installing now.. Will date after I finish installing and get it to work.. I hope it works

,NetBlaise,2013-05-24T08:39Z,Well game works great I didn't need to do anything but mount click on setup and let it install...  Playing the game now.. outstanding job... 
,xZerefx,2013-05-24T13:12Z,"to anyone complaining bout slow download just look at the amount of seeders and leechers ofc its gona be slow,gj on the ul tho"
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2013-05-24T14:01Z,"naYsss, thnx!!!"
,foxskyfull,2013-05-24T21:05Z,the problem with initialize properly (0xc0000142) on xp 32 its with steam_api.dll so i dont crack file steam and game work but i need to have turn on steam when im playing. Before i was not have problem but with this game and dead island ripitide i have with this last to game ist not problem nothing special but only dont want to have steam on to play tihs to games
,F3TiSH,2013-05-24T21:07Z,"@Skankky

I think it's amount of shit on screen that kills performance. Guess I wont even try this one with my low end card."
,Government10,2013-05-25T00:20Z,"Great download speeds for the amount of leechers to seeders (5800/1600 respectively)

speedsvery between 3mb/s to 1mb/s

total elapsed time (as of right now) 52 minutes -- 40% complete.

Thanks EZ (and all the seeders) -- as always."

Thanks!"
,Dorfff,2013-05-26T19:22Z,"aweful game, its truly boring."
,TheNemmy,2013-05-27T06:15Z,"@bighouse5

why don't you youtube techno music ?"
,stubbieaussi,2013-05-27T09:33Z,"Really good action rpg. 
However the game suffers from graphic stuttering on my pc, Win7 64bit, ATI HD6870 Intel dual core 3.2Ghz, 4 gig RAM.
I am going to buy the game from Steam and I will let you guys know if the real version does the same."
,stubbieaussi,2013-05-27T10:40Z,"Well the Steam version has no stutter at all. I noticed that the Steam version I downloaded shows as version 1.0.04 so maybe the latest patch here could also have fixed the problem. But anyway, hope this feedback helps anyone with the same problem. At $15 I'm happy to have bought it. Thanks for the torrent to let me try the game. "
,el_guapito,2013-05-28T15:29Z,"any recommended fix because the ""Go to Palace of Machines"" quest fails on me? I exit to the sewers and this thang crashes everytime..........."
,GObonzo,2013-05-29T16:45Z,"@Skankky & f3tish,
game is running great on the highest settings @1080p with a fx-83202GB-78708GB-1866 system. you got something goin on with your setup of the game or have a very low-end system.
game is the funnest isometric rpg i've played in quite a few years. reminds me of Titan Quest, Diablo 2, Sacred. if you enjoyed those you should love this."
,ItBitTorrent,2013-05-29T17:08Z,"This game is on sale for only 13 bux at Steam. Great game, I'm totally hooked. It took a while to get into it. "

,Saitekman,2013-05-31T03:53Z,"@thename_x

Since no one seemed to address your concerns, I feel compelled to help you with your concerns. First welcome to The Pirate Bay. You must be new here as you would know that Microsoft Security Essentials as well as AVG and other Antiviral Software will indeed throw up false positives for ""Cracked"" games. Another reason I can tell you must be new here as you were questioning the uploader. ""extremezone"" has a green skull, the green skull means trusted. He has never let anyone down and his uploads are usually of the highest quality and definately virus free. If he were to upload trojans he would lose that VIP status and more than likely banned and I would highly doubt he would do that. So feel free to carry on your download or don't download its up to you."
,DeathKinGr,2013-05-31T10:29Z,Seed Please!!!!
,kolokythis,2013-05-31T10:44Z,"Thank you extremezone. Superb torrent as always with the good, simple, RELOADED cracking method."

,Mordor64,2013-06-05T15:06Z,"The game works.  As mentioned by others, the game itself is not very good.  There are a lot of glitches in this version (video hanging) and the crack is not very stable at all.
Since the game is so cheap to purchase, if you really like it, do the right thing (for once) and buy it on Steam."
,mnn08,2013-06-06T02:22Z,"playd it for 12+ houers today worked like a charm i also bought it so i could play with friends :D
