Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On this Wednesday, May 22 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the ongoing scandals plaguing the Obama administration. He takes a look at the use of Homeland Security police to protect IRS offices from Americans expressing their outrage at the taxation agency's brazen intimidation tactics against patriot and Tea Party groups. 

Alex also covers the continuing sovietization of the U.S. economy and new psychiatric guidelines for the over-medication of America's children.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
