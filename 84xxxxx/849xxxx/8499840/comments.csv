Try this one instead of:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8255298/"
,K0i77001,2013-05-25T12:29Z,"You uploaded the .torrent file succesfully to the Pirate Bay. What is wrong is that you do not share the book, you share the original .torrent file = nobody can download the book from you (you just work as a complicated magnet link). You did it nearly correct - but you should have chosen .mobi and .epub files when creating the .torrent file. Just try it one more time, good luck and thank you for trying."
