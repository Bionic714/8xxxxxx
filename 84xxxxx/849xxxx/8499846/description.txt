The best thing about Laos—the female lead singer, she can rock with the best of the male lead singers, maybe better than most. Her power, confidence and ability to rock the house are quite evident in the first two explosive tracks of “We Want It.” After listening to those tracks, I was beginning to think that the CD title wasn’t just a title but a mission statement for Laos. They definitely sound like, ‘they WANT IT’ and are more than capable of getting it.



So the question is why didn’t they get it. “We Want It” by Laos is a re-release of an early 90’s CD with bonus tracks. From the little bit of investigating that I did, I found out that the band disbanded and now Gudrun Laos (who the band was named after, not the country) was last heard singing in a band called Barfly in 1997. Most of the references mention that Gudrun has one the most unique female rocker voices in the business. Yet, she seems to have disappeared. Well with the re-issue of the CD from MTM records, I hope that new and revived interest in Laos will cause Gudrun to come out of hiding and rock this world the way ‘We Want it!’ 



If you get a chance, this CD should definitely be an addition to anyone with an AOR music collection. Gudrun’s vocals are really out of this world, with the added bonus that she doesn’t sing with a German accent.
