As the title says it this is Civilization V for Mountain Lion based on this torrent
 
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5857798/Sid_Meiera__s_Civilization_5_(Mac_OS_X)

However this one is ready to go - no fiddling around or workarounds needed - did them already myself.

Enjoy :)

P.S. This one does not require X11 the way I did it it uses the native OSX Graphics driver and it has no issues running at Full HD 1920 by 1080
