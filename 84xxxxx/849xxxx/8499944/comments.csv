Either Japan got a bad master, or OP is trolling us with a fake FLAC. This is definitely not CD quality FLAC.

Download 1 track to check for yourself."

I don´t know what type of equipment was using the last commenter, but his affirmation is false.

Check your audio codecs before telling lies! :)"
,s1raz1,2013-06-11T05:25Z,"Thank you, album is awesome +1 :D"
,ch0c0s,2013-06-14T11:09Z,"This definitely is not a CD quality FLAC release.

Compare it to any other FLAC releases and you will see.

Chatyx, I'm using high end studio monitors, so please don't blame my equipment for this lackluster release."
