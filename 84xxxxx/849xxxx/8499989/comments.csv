,Peaceall,2013-05-23T10:29Z,Why does Yiffy upload the same movies over and over??
,asimaleem,2013-05-23T13:44Z,"YIFY there is some problem with the file. I can't move forward, it only works from the start. Same with VLC player and KM player"
,solny79,2013-05-23T17:38Z,Same issue here - can't move forward on tv or PC
,beatcrusaders,2013-05-24T05:34Z,Its a corrupted file
,LaFouine2011,2013-05-24T18:51Z,"Hi,

For those with seeking Pb, you can remux the file to mkv :
- Demux Video & Audio with YAMB
- Remux with mkvmerge (mmg.exe in the mkvtoolnix), Video Property (AR 2.40 , FPS 24000/1001p), for the Audio property you have to check the ""AAC is SBR/HE-AAC/AAC+"" case before remuxing.

,TheRealKeyserSoze,2013-05-24T23:30Z,"Looks like corrupted file.  Only starts from beginning, can't jump forward or back in VLC or Windows Media Player."
,AznAssassin,2013-05-25T03:41Z,"Yep same here. Cant seek at all or the file freezes completely. 

FIX UP THE FILE PLZ!!!!"
,imjustwow,2013-05-25T22:11Z,well well...this file does not work like everyone else has been complaining...well YIFY I have loved all your uploads...this one is the only one over the years that has a glitch....it's alright to come out and acknowledge such issue once in a while!!
,JUST_TRYING_TO_HELP,2013-05-31T12:59Z,For all of you who say its freezing its not the file you can't seek because it's 1080p and your computer can't support that. I run into the same problem every time I download 1080p stuff so I just have to watch it on my wife's much newer and more powerful computer. That's your only problem your Video card doesn't support it.
,susupgu,2013-06-02T14:59Z,Install CCCP and stop complaining...
,Robertsx,2013-06-04T21:01Z,"@Peaceall

Yify uploads different file sizes of each movie, so we can choose what quality we want to watch it in."
,Corruptoz,2013-06-05T04:13Z,"Its not because its 1080p, I watch 1080p releases and have no problem pausing resuming or fast forwarding so its not that, just corrupted"
,alchiu,2013-06-08T21:00Z,"Thank you, looks and sound awesome"
,jarrks,2013-06-10T09:06Z,"How to fix the seeking problem:

1. demux file into single tracks (video + audio)
2. mux together again 

Software: MP4Box, mkvmerge

example:
step 1.: commandlines 
MP4Box -raw 1 inputfile.mp4
MP4Box -raw 2 inputfile.mp4

step 2.: start mmg, add both tracks, mux

Done."
