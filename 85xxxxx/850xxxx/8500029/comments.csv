,HateMyJewHair,2013-05-23T03:02Z,"Thank you very much for posting this.

To be pedantic though, this is actually Uncanny Avengers 8UA. Another issue just titled Uncanny Avengers 8 will come out soon. You might want to change the title if you can, just to avoid confusion."

@HateMyHewHair 8 did come out earlier this month, in case you missed it

Regardless, thanks, mirrormaster82, for the upload!"
