This is: the pirate bay-away from keyboard, about their struggle in the Swedish courts. It is in Swedish (I guess), but I hardcoded it with English subtitles...just for you. So now, it's just an .avi file, and y'all won't have to go and search for subtitles (which I found in 10 seconds.)
They may stop the founders, or put them in jail(how dare they!), but don't they even know: thepiratebay is forever!
