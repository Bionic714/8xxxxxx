Thanks Mate."
,Vudu_,2013-05-23T03:43Z,"I think it is the extended version. The length is the same as the 720p extended, 1h 41m. So it must be."
,sofia1975,2013-05-23T04:32Z,So  BOZX... is this the extended version?
,darknight99s,2013-05-23T08:24Z,As Always perfect. Thank you BOZX
,Mikey320,2013-05-23T23:52Z,"is anyone else missing the airport scene? when mcclane gets dropped off at the airport in the beginning of the movie i goes from him pulling up to instantly being dropped off, there is supposed to be like at least 2 minutes of him talking to his daughter who is dropping him off, and you can tell its messed up cause when he is getting out of the car, you can here a audio loop from the last scene, its hard to notice if you didn't see the movie before hand"
,lizardomanson,2013-05-24T13:05Z,"I can't find that airport scene neither and who dropped him on the airport is someone called Murphy, so is not the daughter. "
