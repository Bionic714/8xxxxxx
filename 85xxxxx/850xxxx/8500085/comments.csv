,itlivz,2013-05-23T02:07Z,YOU WIN! Good sir(or madam) I would shake your hand for uploading this so soon. Kerbal rules!&#%@%#^@
,cesarcurado,2013-05-23T02:11Z,"Thanks! :DD
I was waiting for this and it's finally here!

I'd buy this game, but I can't since it is paid in USD, it's really worth it."
,marutidriver,2013-05-23T04:52Z,"Thank you so much for uploading this. I've been trying to download it from the store for hours but Squad's servers get buttfucked every release, forcing me to resort to ""piracy"" for a game I've already bought. Well, at least I won't feel guilty."
,DaryxFox,2013-05-23T10:57Z,So when is the OS X version going to be up?
,Markius_Fox,2013-05-23T11:56Z,"Mac user here. Like DaryxFox, I too would like to see .2 for OSX."
,R0cketor,2013-05-23T14:58Z,Same here as the above two. I request an OSX version if possible. Thanks.
,senhorbarriga,2013-05-23T16:51Z,"Could you please also post the linux version ?

Thanks"
,DIVIIK,2013-05-23T19:32Z,Good Job man!! THANKS
,buss1000,2013-05-23T21:00Z,OSX version will come once I get home (so like 5 more hours sorry). Then Linux will come maybe the day after that because I will be home way earlier. Thanks to all seeders as usual! I'll post a link once it's uploaded so you can seed it too. I don't have a mac but the last time I posted the OSX version of 0.16 people said it worked. Sorry to keep you mac people in the dark. It will come. I'll be seeding till it looks reasonable amount of seeders / leechers. Also I agree with downloading if the servers are under load. Its still really legal and your saving them money with bandwidth and such. Remember to recommend the game to others and buy it when you can!
,Markius_Fox,2013-05-23T21:27Z,S'okay buss1000. I've already seeded this to 1.0 #i'mdidmypart :D
,R0cketor,2013-05-23T23:42Z,"I seeded the Windows to 1.0 to do my part. Just waiting for OSX now, I'll seed that for a while"
,buss1000,2013-05-24T00:39Z,Here is OSX version! http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8503226

,Laserspacer,2013-05-31T18:24Z,Thanks for the upload! Could you please upload version 0.20.2? It has a few bugfixes including memory saving.
,Sambrosia,2013-05-31T22:02Z,"Yup, the latest patch would be nice :)"
,Majant,2013-05-31T23:49Z,"Hey Buss. Could you please upload the 0.20.2 version of KSP? It has important bug fixes that were pretty bad in 0.20 I'm sure I'm not the only one.
0.21.1 would be great itself as it has all the fixes. But 0.20.2 would be lovely.

Thank you

-Maj"
