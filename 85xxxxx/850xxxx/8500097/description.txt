QOTSA: REBORN

Having died on the operating table, Josh Homme has returned 
with an incredible new QOTSA album with help from his 
friends ΓÇô Alex Turner, Trent Reznor, Dave Grohl, and, oh yes, 
Elton John. Full story inside contains life-changing moments, 
riding motorbikes with the Arctic Monkeys and watching 
Game Of Thrones with Jake Shears.
