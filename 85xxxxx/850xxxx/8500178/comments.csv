How the likes of Bush and Obama share that office must have him rolling in his grave."
,tdurden83,2013-05-23T21:45Z,"...and we're supposed to care about what you think, why? the only reason you think Lincoln was the only great prez is because you haven't seen any movies about the others recently "
,Pdid,2013-05-23T22:09Z,"There are other presidents who, for one reason or another, could be considered great. I appreciate zakimar's comment not for his love of Lincoln but for his non-partisan view of both Bush and Obama. Their regimes are more alike than any politically oriented person will ever be able to admit."
,Captain_Ketchup,2013-05-23T23:27Z,"Lincoln a great president? He freed the slaves and didn't send them back to Africa. Lincoln is responsible for most of the violent crime in America. Think of how great America would be without niggers running wild. I know, I know, all men are created equal, but that's just not true. If you truly believe that niggers are not dangerous, violent creatures, then you are extremely ignorant."

You display your ignorance of historical matters. Lincoln was planning a reconciliation with the South, no carpet-baggers or despotic excess in temporary military rule, with Lincoln in power there would not have been a KKK or southern hatred of all thinks yankee. It would have been a different country altogether...

,hatepig,2013-05-24T06:34Z,"There's no such thing as a great president. They'd all be hanged if tried under the Nuremberg precedent. Lincoln personally thought black people were inferior animals who should never be equal to whites, and would have ended the civil war without ending slavery if the south would have surrendered. Not to mention his overseeing native genocides.

As for Captain Ketchup, us white people are responsible BY FAR for most of the murder done on this planet. No other race has used such advanced industrial killing machines on other people as us. Roman Empire, Christian crusades, British Empire, Nazis, all of the US wars with our white European allies. You are impressively ignorant."

,Jack_Reacher,2013-06-07T02:15Z,"@Captain Ketchup ... You don't know just how right you are.  Those poor devils should have been giving some traveling money and put on the next boat back to Africa.  That is not meant as a racist comment, but the damn truth.  "
