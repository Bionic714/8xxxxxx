Surgery Simulator  ( Full Rip )


Lives are in your hands as you take on the role of a top surgeon at a busy city hospital. With eight authentically recreated surgical procedures in your repertoire, your skills are much in demand.

You will need to keep your brain as sharp as your scalpel as you operate on fractures, remove an inflamed appendix or tonsils, treat infected gall bladders, attend to varicose veins, repair hernias, restore vision in cataract procedures and deal with the injuries of a road traffic accident.
