ISBN: 0871403773 | 2013 | EPUB

Pulitzer PrizeΓÇôwinning biologist Edward O. Wilson imparts the wisdom of his storied career to the next generation.

Edward O. Wilson has distilled sixty years of teaching into a book for students, young and old. Reflecting on his coming-of-age in the South as a Boy Scout and a lover of ants and butterflies, Wilson threads these twenty-one letters, each richly illustrated, with autobiographical anecdotes that illuminate his careerΓÇöboth his successes and his failuresΓÇöand his motivations for becoming a biologist.

At a time in human history when our survival is more than ever linked to our understanding of science, Wilson insists that success in the sciences does not depend on mathematical skill, but rather a passion for finding a problem and solving it. From the collapse of stars to the exploration of rain forests and the oceansΓÇÖ depths, Wilson instills a love of the innate creativity of science and a respect for the human beingΓÇÖs modest place in the planetΓÇÖs ecosystem in his readers. 21 illustrations
