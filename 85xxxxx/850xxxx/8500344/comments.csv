,Revisionist,2013-05-24T17:13Z,"Ok yall... I know that its ""real"".  The stats dont list a source though.  Is this an actual retail Bluray rip or one of the Russian or Chinese releases.  I know bozx just uploads what he gets but the encoders often dont provide truthful specs."
,gask8,2013-05-24T20:24Z,  The screen is in 4:3 format but still 720p. good quality
,DonDraperSwagger,2013-05-25T01:55Z,Took a day to download and it's a 4:3 Crop.  Don't bother.  
,Kooblukhan,2013-05-26T06:38Z,screens dont look like a 4:3 crop.  can anyone confirm?
,Rofocale777,2013-05-26T20:03Z,"The first 20 minutes are in 4:3 and b/w to give it a 30's look. After that it is ws and color.
