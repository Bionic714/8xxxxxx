New 20th Century Fox Archives edition of the 1960 film of the D.H. Lawrence novel nominated for several Academy Awards including Best Picture and Actor (Trevor Howard). This transfer, probably the same used in foreign territories earlier (the film has not been previously released on DVD in the US), is not good. It's barely 4 GB but a bit better than I've found here before.
