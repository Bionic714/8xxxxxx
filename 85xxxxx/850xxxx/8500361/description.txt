Notes......: Used the 720p HD video from redhealer. A big
thank you to redhealer for the HD source to replace the
error filled HDTV recording. Am currently helping seed the
720p version.
 
While here, I'd like to thank redhealer for their other 
high-quality original releases. Keep up the great work!
