A nice, clean, small, no bells, no whistles, just f'ing FAST AS HELL version of
the best OS outside Linuxtown. Nobody needs it any slower than this!

It's basically a fully functional XP x64 with everything stripped out (nLite)
except the very basics. Here's an almost complete excerpt from what's left:

 - All keyboard layouts and languages (aren't the interwebs international?)
 - Camera, DHCP, Printer and MS Office compatibility
 - Installable from USB (WinToFlash et al.)
 - Accessibility tools (Magnifier, Narrator, ...), Calculator, Paint, Wordpad
 - Internet Explorer (you'll need some way to download Chrome, won't you)
 - Outlook Express (not very secure but still the slickest Mail-client there is)
 - Removable storage support (those USB sticks and disks still around?)
 - Command line tools (give Windows a nice Bash already!)
 - AMD & Intel CPU drivers with SMP support
 - IPv6 (yes, we all hate it but oh well)
 - DirectX & OpenGL support
 - Ramdisk support
 - VPN support
 - ... and of course the Beep driver because: FU ding.wav! ;)

-==============================================================================-

Integrated mass storage drivers: (from http://www.win-raid.com - thx Fernando!)
 - AMD SB7xx & SB8xx v3.3.1540.33
 - ASMedia SATA3 AHCI v1.3.4.1
 - Intel RST AHCI & RAID v11.2.0.1006
 - Intel MSM AHCI & RAID v8.9.8.1005
 - Intel RSTe AHCI & RAID v12.6.0.1033
 - JMicron RAID R1.17.65
 - nForce Legacy v6.99
 - nForce SATA AHCI v10.3.0.46
 - nForce SATA RAID v10.3.0.46 & v11.1.0.43
 - Silicon Image 31x12 RAID v1.0.65.1
 - VIA RAID v6.01

Now that must be on par with bloaty Seven or something ;)

-==============================================================================-

Things some people might miss and my reasons why it's not included:

 - Windows Updates (makes everything slower - you yell security, I say PEBKAC!)
 - Defragmenter (use Defraggler or an SSD where you basically need no defrag)
 - Games and Screensavers (as in "getting things done"!)
 - All ancient drivers except basic VGA and abovementioned storage drivers
 - Floppy and modem support (you serious?)
 - Cursors, Images, Backgrounds, Samples, Sounds (again: GTD!)
 - Windows Media Player (use VLC)
 - Active Directory support (oh come on, this shit's a mess!)
 - Filesystem encryption (your files belong on a Linux fileserver)
 - Windows Firewall (yes, no updates and no firewall, you're back on your own)
 - Themes (once more: GTD!)
 - CD burning (many things came after that already)
 - Secondary login (simple: one machine, one user - at least where I live)
 - Terminal services (use VNC, TeamViewer or what have you)

-==============================================================================-

Some more notes:

 - Installs within ~5 minutes on your average 2013 PC
 - Administrator is called r00t, Guest is n00b, no initial passwords set
 - Default regional settings and keyboard set to English (US)
 - Attended install i.e. non-automated install, set your options during setup
 - Classic theme, logon page and start menu (did someone say FAST?)
 - no TCP connection limit, USB polling @ 1000 Hz, SFC disabled
 - Lots of minor tweaks (Windows Explorer, network, performance, security, ...)

Disclaimer:

No, this "distro" is not for the average Joe, it's for geeks that crave an OS
with all the modern features the newer Windows version have but hate all the
background activity one doesn't seem to get entirely rid of on those shiny new
OSes. New isn't always better. Heck, even my Windows 3.0 could do exactly the
same things in 1991 that a Windows 8 can do nowadays in 2013, only thing that's
changed is the look. Yes, believe it or not but today we actually do sometimes
wait longer for operations to finish than back then despite having hardware that
is at least 1000x faster! It's called capitalism and marketing.

This is all about getting an OS that does what an OS is supposed to do:
manage hardware and processes, period. Let us, the user care about the rest!

Sure, no updates + no firewall calls for desaster but really, who gives a crap
if you take an image (e.g. Clonezilla) of your Workstation every once in a while
and you keep your files on a Linux fileserver?

-==============================================================================-

tl;dr:

1. This is about "Get out of my way you stupid OS, let me do my work!"
2. This is definitely not about security. No, not at all!
3. If you don't know what cmd.exe or regedit.exe is then this is NOT for you.
