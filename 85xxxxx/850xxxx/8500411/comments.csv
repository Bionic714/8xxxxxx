Suggestions, anyone?"
,Inpuris,2013-05-23T05:50Z,"Update:  I still have the same issue when trying to play this on VLC, but I was able to get this to play correctly on WMP.

Must be an issue of my creation, unless someone else has the same problem.

ettv, it's nothing to do with your work, which is superb as usual.  Thanks for your up."
