Info:
----------
Modern Family is an American comedy series which debuted on ABC on September 23, 2009. Presented in mockumentary style, the fictional characters frequently talk directly into the camera. It tells of Jay Pritchett, his second wife, baby son and stepson, and his two children and their families. Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan conceived the series while sharing stories of their own "modern families".


Plot:
----------
Modern Family employs an ensemble cast. The show revolves around three families living in Los Angeles who are interrelated through Jay Prichett and his children, Claire and Mitchell. Jay (Ed O'Neill), the patriarch, is re-married to a much younger woman, Gloria (Sofía Vergara), a passionate Colombian woman, with whom he has a baby son, Fulgencio (Joe) Pritchett; and a 14-year-old son from Gloria's previous relationship, Manny (Rico Rodriguez). Jay's daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) is a homemaker married to Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell), a real estate agent and self-professed "cool dad". They have three children: Haley (Sarah Hyland) the stereotypical ditzy teenage girl, Alex (Ariel Winter), the nerdy, smart middle child and Luke (Nolan Gould), the offbeat only son. Jay's son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a lawyer, and his partner, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), have an adopted Vietnamese child, Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons).
