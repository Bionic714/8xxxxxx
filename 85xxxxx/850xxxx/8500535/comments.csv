,markall44,2013-05-23T04:46Z,Does this have subtitles for the russian speech?
,ron1169,2013-05-23T06:10Z,it's the .srt file
,kahn1976,2013-05-23T06:40Z,"I joined just to tell YIFY... YOU ARE THE MAN!! Thank you for all of your quality movies! And when you get a chance, I have been looking for ""Oblivion, Olympus Has Fallen, GI Joe Retaliation, and Jack The Giant Slayer"". But there's Nothing Good out there. If you can find them, it would be much appreciated. Thanks again!"
,ChoeyXD,2013-05-23T07:34Z,6515 leechers wow but thanks!
,naj01,2013-05-23T08:21Z,waiting for 1080p .....
,dr_grenadier,2013-05-23T08:44Z,"I'm not sure if it's just my version of VLC, but the subtitles show up early or late, totally not in sync at all. There's a huge pause/freeze when I try to skip to a different part of the video, too. Can anyone help? Thanks."
,eyeshield.21,2013-05-23T08:53Z,@dr_grenadier: Try CCCP. :D
,atifshehzad,2013-05-23T09:03Z,"@dr_grenadier
you have to download new subtitle.
Try this one.

,lordvo1demort12,2013-05-23T09:34Z,this movie is supposed to suck !! don't download it guys !
,DubSesh,2013-05-23T09:55Z,"Terrible subtitles, just like most of recent releases. A:10 V:10. Subtitles, out of sync and no Russian subs for Russian dialogue."
,ewjbtz,2013-05-23T09:57Z,I'm getting the VLC freeze and out of sync subs too.
,krazykhan,2013-05-23T11:26Z,1080p comin? with extended?
,CrysisHawk,2013-05-23T13:42Z,thanks 
,AxOpLiX,2013-05-23T14:31Z,Thanks YIFY!
,ocampy20,2013-05-23T17:17Z,"holy cow! you're so famous YIFY! hahaha, thanks, congrats & more power!"
,SerSpec-V,2013-05-23T18:47Z,No hardcoded subs for Russian parts. The subs that are included are not for extended cut so they are off. Movie will not play on some devices or will play but if you pause it will not continue. You guys should check movie before praising yify.
,Daimonionx,2013-05-23T22:07Z,Please 1080p. Thanks YIFY!

,sopho19,2013-05-23T23:59Z,this rip seems to be censored. the scene where irina takes off her jacket before getting on the damn bike is censored. that is when it was the ONLY saving grace in an otherwise terrible movie.
,sopho19,2013-05-24T00:01Z,the seek function is not working on either VLC or GOM. the movie freezes (or there is a huge pause) when you try to seek forward or backwards.
,tmbrs,2013-05-24T01:16Z,"I'm Russian. I can understand everything in this movie except ""russian speech"". For that I need subtitles. Hollywood is amazing."
,Raiyan14,2013-05-24T01:46Z,This sucks. It's freezing

Took 30 seconds.

,Icetwist,2013-05-24T12:29Z,"@samtronman

Bruce is playing awesome in this movie. Even though its ""hollywood"" as hell, everyone knows what youre getting.

If you watch Die hard and except oscar nominations you should start watching other movies.

I find it entertaining and funny.

A/V 8/8."
,reguser2005,2013-05-24T15:01Z,"@hunk888: Thanks for the Subtitles. They are perfect and also have the english bits for the russian speech.

@roalush: Thanks for the ffmpeg tip. Will definitely try it out to fix the slow-seek issue."

,el_guapito,2013-05-24T17:34Z,fuck this thing is shit! I can`t skip the vid or fast forward or rewind it instantly using VLC...fuck yify is putting out shit quality works first was ghosts of georgia then mama...fuck...you suck yify
,Afzal8920,2013-05-24T17:54Z,awesome upload
,el_guapito,2013-05-24T19:16Z,awesome upload huh? try skipping the video using VLC to the middle and check your task manager...it surges to 100% cpu usage!

,maniaq77,2013-05-25T05:37Z,"damn YIFY - you used to be so good...

this is SHIT!

the file don't SEEK

the subs don't match - because this AIN'T NO ""EXTENDED"" VERSION

what kind of ""exteded"" version CUTS OUT the ENTIRE scene with Mary Elizabeth Winstead - playing his DAUGHTER?

if I could SEEK I might try to skip to the end to see if she is still in the end credits - because that would be kinda strange...

...especially since the SUBTITLES for her scene are STILL THERE

sorry YIFY, you used to be good, but you seem to have let some idiot sources in who are feeding you SHIT"
,juanhidgo,2013-05-25T06:23Z,"It's so funny when idiots download free stuff and still complain about everything...

If you like the movie, go to the store and fucking buy it!...We don't need to read your stupid requests since you don't even seed after downloading...you support nothing to this community and still want to blame someone about your problems??...Please, just fucking die.

OH and btw...YiFY torrents is the best thing for movies and shit right now, so thank you guys so much for sharing and deliver such quality files to everyone, U GUYS RULE!!!"
,el_guapito,2013-05-25T07:27Z,yea and I`m not a blind idiot who eats shit just because someone was previously uploading good quality shit. yify uploads sucks ass now since ghosts of georgia...I think the GaZ schmuck was the one who handled that and now it seems the fucker is handling these recent BULLSHIT uploads as well. I hope that green skull gets pulled back again to make sure yify gets its shit together.
,qazqazcc,2013-05-25T11:00Z,tks
,Rehman5000,2013-05-25T15:32Z,Same with me: VLC freeze and unsynced subs.
,SonnyPLG,2013-05-25T16:57Z,"This version of YIFI is the most largest S & D ATM...

but why we have so many problem here ? cant play the movie, seek or skip, etc... please HELP.
"
,seattleblaze,2013-05-25T17:31Z,"I must say that Yify has had the best rips on the bay for some time now, Thank You Very Much! This movie has several serious issues. It freezes, wont seek, out of sinc, bad subtitles and more. I would not recommend downloading it. Possibly ripped by someone else? Save yourself some trouble and download a different file."
,IamZET,2013-05-25T17:32Z,Thank you YIFY :DD
,SonnyPLG,2013-05-25T17:35Z,"Never mind. i just convert into another mp4 format using Format Factory, and then everything is okay until the end of movie..

but still the softsub really annoying me. maybe i gonna try another torrent."

,agungsp2000,2013-05-26T07:24Z,"you can skip using vlc, but it took 3-5 minutes... cant complain, its free, just be patient"
,obvious2me,2013-05-26T07:51Z,"I haven't tried this one, but YIFY's 1080p version works 100%.

Zero issues with subtitles/seeking/etc."
,tpboss,2013-05-26T11:02Z,"Yes, subs suck (look for publichd ones they work great) and skipping just takes forever. It's pretty much useless to try to skip; it takes about 5 minutes to skip 10. If you plan on watching this be sure you have the hour and a half to dedicate to it for sure."
,suju4646,2013-05-26T14:45Z,"thanks yify for another great upload...video and audio quality is awesome..though the subtitles included in the torrent is out of sync...download the subs from the following link..

,qazqazcc,2013-05-26T15:08Z,"i agreee. subtitles out of sync and seeking the video file using vlc just freezes... Fortunately, i use format factory to reconvert and things are much better now.

,sixor,2013-05-26T22:52Z,"watched the movie

no doubt the video has issues, media player classic takes like 2min to skip a part

also y my asus oplay media player, does the same

the movies works fine unless you fast forward

,kiasta,2013-05-26T22:56Z,Sorry YIFY I usually enjoy your torrents but this was a bad rip and had bad subtitles. Better luck next time. Cheers!
,olepeasy,2013-05-26T23:59Z,YIFY we expect more from you.. but its free so thanks anyway
,Plan9x128,2013-05-27T10:10Z,What is wrong with recent YIFY rips? 
,nikolasea,2013-05-27T22:13Z,there's a problem with the subs because there's a missing scene from this rip and the subs have that scene so it gets out of sync. in the beginning the subs work fine.
,sirwilliamofmarlboro,2013-05-28T01:37Z,"Tv won't play it, downloaded the 720p & 1080p 
Big fan of Yify, and never once had to run any of his vid's through a converter.  STICK WITH WHAT WORKS!  it wasn't broke!"

,rubah_kelabu,2013-05-30T08:01Z,thx YIFY..great upload as always
,x_PseudoAnonymous,2013-05-30T11:22Z,Such a dumb film. The Russian is absolutely horrendous - I'm surprised that those Hollywood Woltzes can't get their mind in order and hire some native speakers and have to embarrass the actors. 
,wmillsw,2013-06-02T17:30Z,"The pirate bay HD-movies section is completly ruined because YIFY shitty rips. Now if you want to see a HD-movie you have to come and shift trough the shit. YIFY rips are in the same section of REAL HD-movies how can this be? Please someone moderate this. Stop uploading this crap here, put it on movies, not fucking here"
,hackmatic,2013-06-05T06:50Z,"Audio is completely missing in parts, like first taxi scene. Subtitles out of sync..

Somebody must be learning to rip?"
,Whiskeyed,2013-06-06T04:37Z,"I have 5gb of data a month on a connection i am lucky to get 60kb/s at. This was a complete waste of 800mb. It is 2013. Yify, use your head. No one wants english subtitles for the english parts of the movie. With a movie with this much Russian in it, an SRT is required. What was going on in your inept head when you uploaded this. I know people say it is free, but others upload this shit for free too without fucking it up. You are on my black list now, i will never download one of your piece of shit torrents again. I would rather spend a few bucks and rent the fucking movie."
,Whiskeyed,2013-06-06T20:25Z,"http://subscene.com/subtitles/a-good-day-to-die-hard/english/735708

Those subs shouldn't go out of synk. Over this weekend i am going to write subs for just the russian parts and upload here. I have no idea how but it can;t be to hard. i am guessing others like me can not afford the bandwidth for another copy. Still blacklisting Yify though."
,Whiskeyed,2013-06-06T20:32Z,"Forgot, to make those work, you can either load them through VLC while watching the movie, or you will have to rename them to ""A.Good.Day.to.Die.Hard.2013.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY.srt"" (obviously without the quotes) and then place them in the same folder as the movie before burning/loading up. You will have to remove/replace the srt that came with this torrent."
,timefix58,2013-06-10T18:18Z,great video and audio but subtitles are not working properly
