BIg Thanks!

I have to ask though - WHY do you duplicate pretty much every torrent thatappears Mactorrents???  people are able to browse you know... or maybe we need a special app on there which you need to upload for us to navigate there.... It's not as if you need to for your seed ratios.... and tpb hall of fame! One site or the other I am sure would do most of us fine... (I guess either could go down tomorrow though that said.... so maybe not such a bad idea... though really TPB is the only one that matters as Mactorrents is merely an index..."
,bjornagainswede,2013-05-23T06:15Z,ETA for a 3MB torrent though is 5h 19m...... go figure...
,ClubQBall,2013-05-23T13:08Z,"What???  

After reading your comment, bjornagain, I *HAD* to download this just to see what the hell was going on.  

It took LESS time for the torrent to download - and begin seeding - than it did for me to sit here and type this response.

27 seeders as of the time this posted."

,hick9,2013-05-23T18:01Z,Took me about 20 seconds! Thanks!

I don't upload every Torrent from MacTorrents to TPB, but when I see one there that isn't on TPB, I upload it.

Hope that answers your question....

,bjornagainswede,2013-05-24T01:41Z,"QBall... No probs.. jut commented cause I thought it was funny... I must have been one of the peers  and uT was having a ball making its mind up... Went to make a cup of coffee and it was done when I got back!,,, I have been having issues with my isp though as well in recent weeks... cut me off totally for hours at a time at night and crawling web most of the time... Seems okay today tho'

This is EXACTLY what I have been looking for so again much thanks PD... Check out also popChar and Typinator for these guys particularly if you're a furriner or live in a furrin Counry and the keyboard is not in your native tongue...

With this app at least I can now figure out what apps are hi-jaking my kbd shortcuts..."
,bjornagainswede,2013-05-24T01:44Z,"@PD... No problem... thanks for the explanation.. Think I said later that it's actually not a bad idea in case MT's index goes down..or even the site itself... Good to have them ""stashed! =)

Ace torrent this one... kinda like the Hotbox in Maya.... Very useful,,,, Thanks again!"
,kendeats,2013-05-27T16:23Z,Seems like a useful app. Thanks.
,chgobugs,2013-06-04T06:02Z,I have a request for a newer version of Akvis Sketch. Your latest one is from 2009. I didn't know who else to ask. Thank you for all you work in the Mac community.
