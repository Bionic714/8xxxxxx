,remotehugger2,2013-05-23T22:48Z,is this supposed to be all tables ? I was only able to get the first one - 
,erroneus,2013-06-03T04:41Z,"I don't get it.  I downloaded and installed but it's stuck on ""Checking game license...""  Why would that be?  The instructions are ""install and play"" so I doubt I missed anything here.  What gives?"
,seevee1969,2013-06-10T02:32Z,"Yep, stuck on ""Checking game license"" (Galaxy tab 2), no tables available"
,seevee1969,2013-06-10T02:38Z,"Update, exit past the ""Checking game license"" message, first table is available but the other 2 give an error message."
