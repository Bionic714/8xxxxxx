,jalucian,2013-05-23T10:21Z,XviD/avi? Seriously? It's 2013. Please stop using XviD and use only x264 encodes or sources.
,obvious2me,2013-05-23T11:23Z,Seriously? It's 2013. I have VLC player (It plays fucking everything).
,culatr,2013-05-23T15:55Z,"Seriously its 2013 - STFU jalucian, and stop bitching about the format you whinny little waste of oxygen.  If you want to cry like a little bitch, then contribute something.  And to think, out of 10 million sperm. IT was the fastest...un fucking believable."
,hederligaarne,2013-05-23T16:00Z,"@jalucian: shut the fuck up. We love the XviD. There are muliple x264 torrents, use them and get lost! "
,Neked,2013-05-23T17:26Z,Actually @hederligaarne The x264 isn't out for this episode. Thats probably why he's complaining.
,DTake2012,2013-05-23T18:23Z,AVI master race!
,madmoxxi,2013-05-23T19:32Z,Please don't waste our time with XViD and avi. The quality is horrible and the container is outdated and incomplete.
,trace535,2013-05-23T20:35Z,"Mythbusters sucks so bad now. They truly have run out of interesting myths. 

It's just another dumb over-produced show on the discovery channel."
