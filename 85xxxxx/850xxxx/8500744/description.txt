
Gunslugs is the most chaotic, fun, arcade action game you'll find on any platform! Non-stop action from the guys behind Meganoid, Meganoid 2 and Stardash !

- ΓÇ£ThereΓÇÖs so much praise I want to ramble on about, but IΓÇÖll leave it at this: Gunslugs is a game you must get your hands onΓÇ¥ ΓÇô Gamezebo

- Basically, itΓÇÖs everything you could ask for from a rampaging action game, all packed up in a neat little mobile release with ample amounts of retro-style visuals, music and secrets.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇô JayIsGames

- We grabbed a bunch of expendable action hero's from the 80s and we made them team up as the Gunslugs to fight the war against the always evil Black Duck Army. Can you save the planet? maybe even the universe?
