Pretty decent one-off CD from when the main guy behind FFS decided to do a band album, interesting sounds throughout and definitely worth a download.

From Last.fm:
FUTURE FUNK SQUAD is actually just one person, über-producer Glen Nicholls. One of the most respected figures in the international breakbeat scene, he’s remixed more name artists than you can shake a funky stick at and DJ’d all over the world.
The Prodigy (twice), UNKLE, White Lies, Hybrid, Muse, Mylo, Stanton Warriors and Bomb The Bass are just a few of the acts who’ve benefited from a FFS respray, not to mention some of his childhood heroes such as Yazoo.
Future Funk Squad did become a band in the mid-noughties, producing the acclaimed ‘Audio Damage’ album and touring with a full six-piece live set-up. But lately Glen has taken the FFS sound back to its DJ/producer roots, releasing the ‘Disorders Of Skill’ album and leaving behind the record label that tried to make him go too commercial.
