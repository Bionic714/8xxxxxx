a little known Darkwave band's discography, I had this uploaded on Demonoid originally. I cannot express how awesome this band is, really a good find I stumbled upon awhile back.

From the Last.fm page: (sorry, no wikipedia!)
A darkwave band from Tampa, Florida, Butterfly Messiah have released two albums: Priestess (2000) and Eternal (2004). Butterfly Messiah disbanded in 2005, with members Shannon Lyn Garson and Robert Davis turning their attentions to a new project, The Seahorse Orchestra. Joshua Harrington went on to join post rock band Petrograd In Transit as well as continuing his solo career.
