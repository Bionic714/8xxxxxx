,ziggyff,2013-05-23T19:04Z,"Ditto on the repeated segment info..I thought it might be an edit from the TV station as there were touchy subjects discussed,  but checking with the CBS website version shows this was a longer video than their online stream,  so nothing was cut out of the original broadcast as far as i can tell...and also my thanks as well"
,flg8rfan,2013-05-30T07:22Z,"I don't believe anything was cut (or re-run to cover something else).  This episode is 46:52 in length, and the repeated segment is almost exactly 7:00 long.  His shows are usually between 39:55 and 40:05, so I think it was just doubled up in error when packaging."
