,unreadable33,2013-05-27T16:11Z,"TO EVERYONE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH LOW FPS RATE. 

 Here's a fix that brought me from 10-15 fps up to around 60. It's not your hardware, its a bug that Ubisoft is trying to patch. Until then, try this.

 1. Enter the Ease of access center which can be accessed through Accessories after clicking Start.
 2.Once, you are there, click ‘Make the Keyboard Easier to use’.
 3. Click ‘Turn on Repeat Keys and Slow Keys’,and then on ‘Set up Repeat Keys and Slow Keys’.
 4. Select the “ignore all repeated keys” option and reduce the time to 0.0 mentioned in the box. 
 5. Make sure that ‘Turn on Filter Keys’ is ticked at the top of the panel.
 6.Apply the changes and see if the stutter goes away with it.

 Hope this helps. This fix made the game so much more enjoyable for me."
