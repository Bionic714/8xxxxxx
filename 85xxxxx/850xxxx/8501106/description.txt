HE LOCATION: Undisclosed THE THREAT: UnconFirmed (but scary as hell) OUR ONLY HOPE: Two high school dropouts who really have better things to do with their time than prevent the apocalypse Its street name is Soy Sauce - a drug that lets its users drift across time and dimensions. But sometimes, those who come back bring something with them. Suddenly, a silent otherworldly invasion is underway, and mankind needs a hero. What it gets instead is John and David, a pair of dropouts who can barely hold down jobs. Can these two stop the oncoming horror in time to save humanity? No. No, they can't ... "Wong is like a mash-up of Douglas Adams and Stephen King ... 'page-turner' is an understatement." ?Don Coscarelli, Director, PHANTASM I-IV, BUBBA HO-TEP "compelling-against-all-odds ... laugh-out-loud ?funny" KIRKUS REVIEWS "the book's smart take on fear manages to tap into ?readers' existential dread on one page, then have them laughing the next."
