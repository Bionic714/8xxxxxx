This is the original bartender song, Sittin' at a Bar from Rehab's 2000 album Southern Discomfort.

The only versions I could find were the remix with Hank Williams Jr. and the re-issue from 2008. This is the original explicit version, I can't be the only one that can't stand the re-issue versions.

I used AVS audio editor 7.1 for 44100 Hz; Stereo; 320 Kbps.

Enjoy, let me know if there is any issues or requests.
