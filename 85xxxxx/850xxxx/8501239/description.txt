AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM HOPPYHARRINGTON...

When is the last time you thanked your speakers???

Speakers, unlike uploaders, who are inferior beings with no soul and should be dealt with in the same way as Bangladeshi garment workers, Chinese Foxconn employees, Palestinians trying to survive in the open-air prison camp known as the Gaza strip, or legitimately elected popular Haitian presidents, anyhow I digress...

Speakers, need thanks and love in order to properly fulfill their function in life, which is to tickle your ears, open your hearts, and nourish your souls through a complicated process of manipulting air molecules or something along those lines.

Several studies indicate that concentrating and expressing positive emotions towards your speakers can generate health benefits for yourself and improved performance for your speakers.

They also like to have their cabinets gently stroked.

Thank your speakers for a better world today!!!
