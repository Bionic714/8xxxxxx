Food writer Robb Walsh is the T.R. Fehrenbach of Texas culinary history. While Fehrenbach has chronicled Texas history, Walsh's books--The Tex-Mex Cookbook, Legends of Texas Barbecue Cookbook and The Texas Cowbo Cookbook--honor the state's food traditions with recipes and revisionist accounts of how our Lone Star staples came to be. Many of the articles he pens for the Houston Press--where he's been head restaurant reviewer for almost 10 years-- have been nominated for James Beard awards.
