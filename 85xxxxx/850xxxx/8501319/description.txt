description:

Reflecting Thomas Merton's lifelong examination of the relationship between the monastic, contemplative life and the need for spiritual expression in the secular world, these essays explore the coming together of the active and the contemplative life and the relationship of individuals to society. Ranging from an account of the Greek monastic community on Mt. Athos to a look at the spiritually destructive power of racism, Merton's writing is both lively and profound as he leads the reader through the hard questions of modern existence, bringing together traditional religious values with a concern for the spiritual needs of the present day.

"Merton was...one of the most prophetic Catholic writers of our time" (New Republic). Preface by Father M. Louis.
