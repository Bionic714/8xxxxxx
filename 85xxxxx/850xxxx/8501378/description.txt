ENCODE
here comes the Ultimate Quality version (UQ)
as i read on the comments of my avi a lot of guys want a hd version
so i decided to make you one straight from the source too
brightness, contrast, rgb as needed, sharpness is untouched there was no need for it
appended the after-end-credits scene in hd too again. so complete now
Encoded in highest possible quality with setting High@L5.1 @bitrate 4000
had to resync audio from scratch one, it was rather complicated for mkv
you cant drop frames like on avi took me 24h of audio syncing, yes its lipsync again
made audio louder, replaced the crackling spot i had missed in the avi with audio from unknown
This encode is the highest quality possible, with nice line, no subs no watermarks, no blurs
Are you still up for another round?
got superduper nice
enjoy

ps: its definitely the last IR3 version from my end til retail
