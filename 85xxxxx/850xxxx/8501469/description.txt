Hi,

I dug out this DVD because after installing XP32 over the very bad running Windows 7 on a friend's new laptop, I noticed only select language packs are currently available for download (portugese, russian, polish) and not the complete set.

[Copied from a description taken from someone else's now-dead torrent upload:]
This AIO DVD IMAGE contains the multilanguage user interface packs for:
Windows 2000,
Windows XP Professional,
and Windows 2003 Server.

"Standalone ISOs for any of the CDs included in this release can be made using the autorun."

The DVD IMAGE contains:

Windows XP Multilanguage User Interface CD1
Windows XP Multilanguage User Interface CD2
Windows XP Multilanguage User Interface CD3
Windows XP Multilanguage User Interface CD4
Windows XP Multilanguage User Interface CD5

Windows 2003 Multilanguage User Interface CD1
Windows 2003 Multilanguage User Interface CD2
Windows 2003 Multilanguage User Interface CD3
Windows 2003 Multilanguage User Interface CD4

Windows 2000 Multilanguage User Interface CD2
Windows 2000 Multilanguage User Interface CD3


My notes: After installing the ENGLISH (International/Standard) language version of XP Pro, 2K or Server 2003, use DAEMON TOOLS LITE with this DVD image and (on the drive letter __ which appears, click it to) install the MUI pack you wish. 


Alternatively this image can be burnt AS AN IMAGE to a DVD.
