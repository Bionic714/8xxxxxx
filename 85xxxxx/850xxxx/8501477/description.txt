The Russia House (1990)


Three notebooks supposedly containing Russian military secrets are handed to a British publisher during a Russian book conference. The British secret service are naturally keen to learn if these notebooks are the genuine article. To this end, they enlist the help of the scruffy British publisher Barley Blair, who has plenty of experience with Russia and Russians. Barley, an unconventional character who doesn't respond well to authority, finds himself in a game more complex than he first thought when he digs into the origin of the notebooks.

Authentic and beautifully filmed on location; all actors excellent! My parents were born in and emigrated from the Ukraine. They have firsthand knowledge of the way the Soviet government operated. The details in the movie are very true to life under the Soviet regime. The plot is complex but life is also complex; especially under a repressive regime. I found the movie riveting; the plot keeps you guessing until the end. It is beautifully filmed on location. The actors are all excellent and very well cast. In addition, the music is wonderful; not only as a movie score but on its own, as well. Although some may find the plot difficult to follow (you do have to pay attention), it is well worth the viewing. After all, spying is a complex business.
