Remember that those images are compressed so it doesn't reflect 100% quality too.

Download 1 episode of this or any show to get an idea of what the iTunes 1080p shows are like :D.

Granted it may have a lower than standard bitrate but imo it is the best since logoless and advert (lower banners) free :).

Am just here to talk about some misconceptions on WEB-DL from iTunes store."
