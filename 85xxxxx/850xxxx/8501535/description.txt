Description :
  The first part of the game and remember liking the domestic players. Reckless and desperate loner hero returned to once again shake the rotten corrupt regime! After the brilliant work done by pointing a "democratic" about a real macho Rico Rodriguez decided to break away from the full program. Tequila, beaches, babes in bikini - what more should be tired, but quite a hero? But a long holiday did not happen. Former boss hurried escape to the tropical island of Pana, taking with him a large sum of public money. Traitor hid under the warm wing of the local dictator, which means it's time to "banana revolution!" We'll have to find and punish the villain, and along with good fun in an atmosphere of general chaos. Shooting, car chases, parachute jumping, car theft and military equipment - Rico is ready for anyone, even the most dangerous situation.
