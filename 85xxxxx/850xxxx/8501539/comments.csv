[T],hypercenter666,2013-05-23T16:28Z,great copy. thank you very much
,greasyHampster,2013-05-23T16:44Z,"so ais all the information on YIFI torrents correct??? ive only down loaded one thus far because i didnt believe they were actually the resolution posted, because ive always downed from BOZX who is VERY legit and his 720p movies are all around 4-6 gig depending on length of movie etc etc. I see YIFI has a very loyal following..Just wandering if i switch will i be losing quality???? welcome all intelligent responses.lol"
,greasyHampster,2013-05-23T16:45Z,or just gainning a ton of hard drive space when i re download everything
,MrPrinceNadir,2013-05-23T18:20Z,@Krazykhan... he still uploads 1080p... and @greasyHampster ... Yify's torrents are excellent.. just download and confirm it... 
,bad216,2013-05-23T18:30Z,not working for me
,jellie1343,2013-05-23T20:41Z,"@greasy hampster.....video quality will still be excellent from yifi but u may have a slight edge in audio when u use bozx....anyway i think u still will be happy with the switch...if u like go directly to his own website...set up quite nice for 720 and 1080p

Thanx YIFI ! "
,trevab2,2013-05-23T21:32Z,"Great quality as usual
V-9
A-10
M- im not a fuc kin movie critic.

@greasyhampster- I was also downloading from a few other people that had a lot bigger movie sizes.  Yify has the same quality on his 720's as the others do on their 4 and 5 gig files.  Some people dont like that they have to turn up the volume on the movies....I figure i'll turn up the volume and save a terabyte of external hard drive space."
,Daimonionx,2013-05-23T22:07Z,Please 1080p. Thanks YIFY!
,alexslife,2013-05-23T22:30Z,"For the average middle age balding man, YIFY movies that are 720p resolution yet DVD quality these would be fine...

For the rest of us who want quality and DTS surround....this is not up to my standards"
[T],micron66,2013-05-24T00:05Z,SEED PLEASE !!! Stuck at 86 % due to low speeds! 
,sixthelvis,2013-05-24T00:33Z,"this is some bad 4:3 video + crappy audio
dunno what happened - first time i'm unsatisfied with a yify torrent."
,ICManiac,2013-05-24T17:40Z,"@sixthelvis
First off... *slap* you went full retard, second, thats how the movie starts, 3rd the Audio is supposed to sound like it was back in 70's in the start, the audio will get better, satisfied now?
- *pats* good boy."
,maniaq77,2013-05-25T05:45Z,"I just have one question:

are you able to SEEK and not send your CPU to 100% with this rip?

coz lately YIFY has had some real shockers on here..."
,safta420,2013-05-25T07:25Z,"@greasyhamster. if you have already been downloading the 4+GB rips then don't switch. The video bitrate will be half, if not more, the standard 720p release. You will notice more macroblocking because of this, unless you are nearly blind like some people seem to be. The audio is suitable for playing it on a phone, super low bitrate and terrible frequency."
,C0rt3z1,2013-05-25T21:08Z,"I must agree with safta420. There is a notable difference in quality. Yifi Torrents are great though... Its about every one own needs. In my case i download Yifi Torrents because of the size, and quality its ok. (i cant afford downloading big files). Ty Yifi :) "
,iamdnp01,2013-05-26T00:30Z,Thanks a lot... a/v 8/9... cheers...
,fismaker,2013-05-26T04:17Z,Good
,Novoid69,2013-05-26T18:28Z,"Hey i have a request to you. Can you please upload the movie ""Neon Flesh"" ? Even the 480p RIP will do. 

Thank You. Always appreciate your uploads."
,3club,2013-05-26T19:40Z,"DVD resolution is 720 x 480 (that's 480p).  720p is much higher than DVD.  I don't think my old computer and monitor could handle 1080p, so 720 is perfect for me.  Thanks YIFY!"
,boxatoys,2013-05-26T23:30Z,"Was going to stop watching as it was boring as hell but carried on till the end, sigh.

Didn't find it worth 6.7 on IMDB and score it at around 4 and just worth watching once.

V=8
A=8
M=4"
,camelian,2013-05-27T05:15Z,This movie has cinavia protec removed ?
,oceanroar,2013-05-27T11:33Z,"This is not HD by any definition of the word and should not be in this section, like most of YIFY torrents.  The file size to quality ratio is great and I can't fauly YIFY for that but as always it is NOT HD. 

It's even tagged as 1080p... WHY? it's not even 720p as it says in the title! it's 1280x536.

I think TPB seriously needs a HD section as well as the current 'Hi-Res' page... one where the files MUST meet the resolution requirement for the people in first world countries with fast and ulimited bandwidth who care more about quality than a small filesize. 

TLDR: Good quality for filesize but is absolutely not high definition  or comparable at all to 7 Gig 1080p movies."
,Polyblendz,2013-05-27T17:03Z,"@Oceanroar I totally agree maybe YIFY doesnt have a FullHDTV to realize the difference or home theatre system to understand true dpeth in sound and picture, no hating to YIFY"
,nerfnigga,2013-05-27T19:50Z,I loved this movie. Shit was fun as fuck to watch. and mila kunis's tits look like they just want to pop out after she eats that apple.....  and I loved  Zach Braff being a monkey talking about Emerald City's infrastructure xD 
,Triggerhand,2013-05-28T01:07Z,"V:10
A:10
M:5 Horrible movie very boring till the end. I found the acting quite bad. would not watch again."
,pro346pro,2013-05-28T05:47Z,@ocean roar your a dickhead 1280*536 is the same as 720p the black bars have just been cropped out! Have a look at the aspect you fucking ass monkey and this goes for all the other fuck wits that complain about this! Not all movies have 16:9 aspect!
,CrysisHawk,2013-05-28T12:50Z,"Thanks YIFY :)

Could you please upload

""Epic"" and ""The Croods""

TY "
,caphorn,2013-05-28T21:57Z,"oh my god, that movie sucks so much... a shame for those actors...

a boring story, a very bad acting

thanks YIFI, you do your job, but don't download dudes, it's  a loss of time"
,bashpr0mpt,2013-05-28T22:09Z,There is something seriously wrong with the sound levels in this version. It's seriously RIP for headphone users.
,zLenin,2013-05-30T12:32Z,thanks :D
,therion369,2013-05-31T03:59Z,Thank You ! YIFY
,wtfck,2013-05-31T16:13Z,"YiFY, Can you please upload The Croods 1080p?"
,wmillsw,2013-06-02T17:26Z,"The pirate bay HD-movies section is completly ruined because YIFY shitty rips. Now if you want to see a HD-movie you have to come and shift trough the shit. YIFY rips are in the same section of REAL HD-movies how can this be? Please someone moderate this. Stop uploading this crap here, put it on movies, not fucking here"
,vypliv,2013-06-03T16:38Z,"Let me remind you, all you clever presidents of planet Earth, if you are not serious with uploading, only simple ""thank you"" is expected from you. 
People criticising others work while doing nothing deserve to be loved up their ass in the way they dont like it."
,kriskj,2013-06-04T18:57Z,"The point is @vypliv, that YIFY steals seeders from all the good quality torrents + that it fuckes up the HD section... That's why we bitch and whine about it!"
,JamJulLison,2013-06-09T06:12Z,As usual people want to bitch and moan over YIFI quality. I haven't downloaded this yet but I can vouch for his other work.  It is good work. Yes the audio isn't surround sound. But for watching on my PC the audio is just fine for his stuff. Now if your planning on burning it off or something so you can watch it on your HDTV then yes you need to download one from another uploader. Just for the better audio.  
,JamJulLison,2013-06-09T06:13Z,Only on rare occasions with his videos have I noticed any issues with the picture.  Before someone says his stuff isn't HD. Educate yourself on what HD is. 720p is HD.  Most blueray rips of movies are in the movies actual movie aspect ration. Meaning the majority are not 16:9.  
,LadyBot,2013-06-13T04:41Z,"Great DL, thx YIFY!

As for the movie..
I give it an 8.

A somewhat kiddo story turned adult -- yet
can still satisfy both aspects in it's own way.

Worth a watch if you have the 2 hours to spare.
Was a visually stunning film. Enjoy!"
,_fmh__,2013-06-13T19:31Z,"do call this a "" movie "" shame on the actors



thanks YIFY you'r the best"
