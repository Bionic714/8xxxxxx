Are you ready to learn how to program a computer? Youll do just that in this book. PROGRAMMING LIKE A PRO FOR TEENS is written in a friendly, unassuming voice that makes it possible for you to master the ideas and concepts that professionals use for programming every day. You learn algorithmic thinking and problem-solving in addition to the C++ language. This book takes a different approach than others that teach programming. It focuses on problem-solving techniques and thought processes and introduces features at your level of complexity. Introductory problem-solving techniques pave the way toward increasingly more advanced techniques. This approach allows you to engage in meaningful programming experiences early in the book, which motivates you to continue. Solutions to end-of-chapter exercises, source code, and other learning materials are included on the companion website.
