They say you canΓÇÖt teach an old dog new tricks. But what about relativity?
Physics professor Chad Orzel and his inquisitive canine companion, Emmy, tackle the concepts of general relativity in this irresistible introduction to EinsteinΓÇÖs physics. Through armchairΓÇöand sometimes passenger-seatΓÇöconversations with Emmy about the relative speeds of dog and cat motion or the logistics of squirrel-chasing, Orzel translates complex Einsteinian ideasΓÇöthe slowing of time for a moving observer, the shrinking of moving objects, the effects of gravity on light and time, black holes, the Big Bang, and of course, E=mc2ΓÇöinto examples simple enough for a dog to understand.
 
A lively romp through one of the great theories of modern physics, How to Teach Relativity to Your Dog will teach you everything you ever wanted to know about space, time, and anything else you might have slept through in high school physics class.
