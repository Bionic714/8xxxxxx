Source ...: Retail Blu-Ray
Lang .....: English / Spanish

Screens ..: Opening Week - 1986
Genre ....: Drama | History | Thriller | War

Notes ....: There's quite a bit of spanish on this movie, some of it is considered
            incidental, and only the important parts are traslated. The blu-ray 
            doesn't have full english subs, only forced ones and we noticed some 
            errors in them. We therefore checked out our retail US and UK retail
            DVD copies, and it appears about the same bits are translated on them
            too. The UK one has a few more sentences translated, and the rest is
            transcribed in spanish as is. The US disc just uses [SPEAKS SPANISH] 
            captions instead. We've added the full & forced subs from the UK
            DVD edition as well.
