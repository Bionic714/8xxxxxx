However, it's stretched and the (eng) subs are hard-coded. You need VLC to disable the subs and change the aspect ratio to 2.35:1. There ia a small watermark, but it's not too obtrusive. 
It's worth the d/l considering it's the only copy on tpb right now. Thanks for the up."
,1EdgyGuy,2013-06-07T05:16Z,excellent movie thank you UL'er
,santeros,2013-06-13T15:47Z,"mrwolf71 : i already put the information about ratio. it 16:9, so it full HD.. The sub for my country where people mostly read the sub to understand more when the actor talk fast. English not our country main language. :)

and the sub not hard code or hard sub, coz i just muxe in with the V/A. so it can be turn off.

Sorry for the watermark, that my trademark :D

mrwolf & edgy : thank for your comment. :)"
