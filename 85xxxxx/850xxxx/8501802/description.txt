Every few months, when there are a multiple of five playlists, the Dutch Treat Indie collection is updated. The lists are renumbered and may contain some minor corrections.

I used this opportunity to make a small change by keeping the type of list within the title and change this number into a bit more logical order. The type of lists are:

1 = Soft Pop and Folk, top sound quality.
2 = A mix of Rock and Pop, a bit more extreme and little less sound quality
3 = Electronic, varying from chill to Rock
4 = Solid Rock
5 = Garage Rock and Dance

Not being real playlists, the unsorted (I9) lists are not included and only downloadable from the monthly uploads.

Enjoy:
