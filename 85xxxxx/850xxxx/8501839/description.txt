Nancy Elizabeth returns with a graceful third album that isn't afraid of its own intelligence. Opener ΓÇÿThe Last BattleΓÇÖ is indicative of the Manchester-based talent's present ambition, her voice multi-tracked into a dramatic, Morricone-style chorus, the sighing strings and vibrato guitar underlining that spag-western vibe and also nodding to the mariachi-flavoured psych of LoveΓÇÖs ΓÇÿAlone Again OrΓÇÖ. ΓÇÿHeartΓÇÖ sounds like a less fragile Julia Holter, precious vocal harmonies and subtle synth zaps orbiting an almost new jack swing-style rhythm, but Elizabeth doesnΓÇÖt settle into a predictable pattern: each song is given a unique treatment, whether itΓÇÖs the pillowy cold wave string-pads cushioning ΓÇÿSimon Says DanceΓÇÖ or the limpid piano minimalism of ΓÇÿDesireΓÇÖ. She doesnΓÇÖt overegg the pudding, paring the arrangements down to the essential, and rightly giving her glassily elegant vocals room to breathe - whether soloing intimately and unadorned or studio-spun into vast waves of harmony. Atmospheric, ambient-aware singer/songwriter fare has become an overcrowded genre in recent years, but itΓÇÖs worth making room for this on your deck if you dig Holter, Colleen, Julianna Barwick, etc.
