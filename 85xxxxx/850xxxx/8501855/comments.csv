[V],psspss,2013-05-24T14:28Z,"

[V],psspss,2013-05-24T14:53Z,"lol seems we posted about same time.. but my comment didnt show
this will force it to show perhaps posting a 2nd one

yes please get it and share.. Im cutting back already.. prob only doing some ghost and ufo stuff again.. as ive eaten up 80gb now in 4 days.. easy to do is it not  .. more so if you share 30gb of it"
[V],psspss,2013-05-24T14:58Z,"LOL I see someone took my rips and added them to direct downloads now.. and dropped the titles

odd anyhow.. I wasnt sure on airdates looks like they are a little of like 7 days? no biggy"
,spied1,2013-05-24T15:17Z,"Awesome psspss, sorry will seed for a long while. Have trouble commenting as every time i log in it states my log in password is screwed. Keep resetting but alas. Appreciate the avi's and the Australian content. CBE :)"
,beechyboy,2013-05-24T15:18Z,"I have episode #3 (mkv)
Since your running out of data (what's new?) I will re-encode it to a smaller size .avi and upload it soon.
Watched episode #1 and it wasn't too bad. It's not as good as American or Canadian Picker, but well worth watching for sure!"
[V],psspss,2013-05-24T16:53Z,"yep I see you have a avi up for Ep3.. do post a url to it if wish

tne etc keep going on about my comments and my so called ego and self promotions but really im just alerting people to stuff they might like and MIGHT OF MISSED thats all.. no ego.. after all im one that dont add tags to my filenames

so no issue with others posting other interesting or extra or missing episodes in comments to inform people..

glad you enjoyed it.. but its was OK but I only added cos people requested it I prob wont do more of it as its not really for me.. and ive always said I want to get back to the root shows I do in paranormal and ufo scene"
,beechyboy,2013-05-24T19:39Z,"I decided to use .avi instead of .mp4
because like you said, it's a more sought after format.
Episode #3 interests me because of the motorcycles in that episode.
