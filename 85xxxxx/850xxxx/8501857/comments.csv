,oldcarman,2013-05-23T18:18Z,"Thanks a lot,  your certainly ""on the ball""....."
,Novsann,2013-05-23T19:17Z,Thank you
,Viciously,2013-05-23T20:26Z,"Lame.

The video starts just a few seconds before the light goes green and ends soon after the session ends. No commentary before or after."
,Viciously,2013-05-23T21:23Z,"Not downloading any more. FP1 took 9 hours.

FP2 by Fairplay is out. Will be downloaded in an hour.

Difference is clear. ;)"
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T21:26Z,"Better then nothing. Its this torrent or nothing, its the only upload out there today. 

Thanks uploader. Keep them coming please."
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T21:27Z,Where did you find it?
,Viciously,2013-05-23T21:28Z,...
,Viciously,2013-05-23T21:29Z,"Private sites.

Still, I was amazed to see 1500+ peers on these two torrents. Never saw this many!."
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T21:41Z,"Thanks, i found the fairplay one too ;)"
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T21:42Z,Double size but 100 times the download speed
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T21:52Z,"Yeah 1500 leechers. Was hoping to enjoy monaco today but almost bed time now.

Guess i just have to shorten sleep time and do back to back practice. Time to crack a few beers :)"
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T23:37Z,"After watching this video, three comments.

Nr. 1: Why mpeg4? It sucks, only vlc will play it, barely.

Nr.2: No pre or post.

Nr.3: Audio is off sync, lagging.
(Engine noise comes after the car has gone trough the corner) "
,NordicF1,2013-05-23T23:39Z,Ill give you a sucks out of 10.
,mikrovision,2013-05-24T00:12Z,Spot on comment NordicF1.
,IAMH67,2013-05-24T03:06Z,"To those of you with sync issues, try using Media Player classic or windows media player. This file has an interlace (read technical info line ""Delay relative to video    : -186ms "") so that when you skip to a particular point in the video, the video will pause for a couple of seconds to let the audio sync with the video. I watched both sessions from the same file myself and there are no sync issues but VLC creates the sync problem by not running the file properly.

Also MPEG is only the container. You can rename this file to .avi you want and it will still work because .avi also uses AVC and this file is AVC. It is no different than a .avi file as underneath it is using the same codec. I'm using MPEG because it saves space. The same file in .avi would be at least 2+ GB. If you go to KAT and see these same torrents and read the comments no one has a problem playing the file.

The seeding was slower than usual because I was uploading both FP1 + FP2 and both had 1500+ downloaders. I'll upload 1 torrent in the future instead of getting both out fast though it will still take the same time in total."
,crypticcpi,2013-05-24T10:37Z,"Thanks for the upload and effort IAMH67!
Really appreciate it!"
,55trucker,2013-05-24T13:48Z,What happened to the original 6ch Dolby AC3 audio?
,chem_101,2013-05-24T22:44Z,Seed! Thank you IAMH67!
,chem_101,2013-05-25T01:04Z,Seeding until FP3 comes out at least.
,pxpierre,2013-05-25T05:50Z,"Thank you IAMH67 & seeders.

And fuzz the whiners!"
