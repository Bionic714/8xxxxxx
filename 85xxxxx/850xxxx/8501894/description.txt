Sixty years after Irma Rombauer advised new cooks to "Stand facing the stove," America's love affair with "Joy of Cooking" continues unabated. And why not? "Joy" in hand, tens of millions of people -- from novices to professionals -- have learned to do everything from make a meat loaf to clean a squid to frost a wedding cake. For decades, "Joy of Cooking" has taught America how to cook, serving as the standard against which all other cookbooks are judged.

"All About Salads & Dressings" upholds that standard. While keeping the conversational and instructional manner of the flagship book, "All About Salads & Dressings" is organized by salad type including green; vegetable and savory fruit; bean and grain; fish and shellfish; meat and poultry -- with such delicious classics and exciting innovations as Caesar Salad; Thai Beef Salad; Grilled Swordfish, Tangerine, and Jicama Salad; Tomato and Mozzarella Salad; Hot Apple Slaw; and Three-Bean Salad. And don't forget the dressings: everything from Basic Vinaigrette to creamy Green Goddess Dressing is covered. With a full primer on varieties of lettuce and suggestions for garnishing, "All About Salads & Dressings" illustrates how much more there is to salad than just lettuce.

Whether you belong to one of the millions of American households that already own a copy (or two) of "Joy," or you have never cracked the spine of a cookbook before, "Joy of Cooking: All About Salads & Dressings" is for you. It is a spectacular achievement, worthy of its name. "Joy" has never been more beautiful.
