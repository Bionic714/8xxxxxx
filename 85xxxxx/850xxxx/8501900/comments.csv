It's watchable, but I quit after about a half hour.  Missing especially a lot of audio effects, which gives this version a very flat feeling.  Seems like a very early 'for consideration' type of release.  Video quality is actually okay, still somewhat pixelated, but honestly way better than most cams, maybe on-par with a normal (non Blu-Ray) DVD release.  Really for me it was the audio that left a lot to be desired.  My ratings up there are based on a comparison to a final, clean Blu-Ray release.  If you absolutely MUST see this movie now, you can, this works.  If you want all the bells and whistles, I'd wait.  "
,4vrDwnldr,2013-05-24T19:57Z,"i don't know what mudget is talking about. its like watching a VHS quality movie. its perfectly watchable. its the full movie.

not HD, more like standard 900mb pixelated digital movie.

10a/9v

the only thing i noticed that was weird was at random times the movie would speed up certain scenes. i set play speed to .96 on VLC player and it fixed it.

mark sure you fast forward to the end of the credits and watch the little scene at the end as well.

oh there are foreign subtitles when words come up in the movie. not full subtitles, just word translations."
,at.skl,2013-05-25T04:27Z,Thanks. It's a nice release for this time.
