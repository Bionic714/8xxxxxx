1) I'll be seeding this for a week. All hail Mothra for another classic collection upload!

2) If you have one of those ""plug-n-pray"" ethernet-capable mini-servers - the ones based on that Creation of Satan, ""Linux"", then force it to take a VERY high fixed IP address, a number that a home network of less than 8 systems wouldn wind up hanging the wireless hub on - like a number above .100.

Headache = On."
