OK, time for a couple more obscure heroes from the 40's!  This one is pretty cool, and was in alot of the same books as the black terror: American Eagle!

His Origin:

In a remote mountain laboratory, timid scientist Tom Standish is assisting Dr. Wolfe's experiments in creating a serum that can mimic the strength and buoyancy of an eagle. While trying to put a successful batch of serum in storage, Standish accidentally drops the formula and it spills onto a cathode-tube, causing it to glow with a strange light. Curious as to how the tube has been changed, Standish inserts the tube into a projector and his body is instantly bombarded with black light. Tom goes to tell Dr. Wolfe what happened, but walks in on Dr. Wolfe conspiring with fellow Nazis to poison America's water supply. Tom is assaulted and thrown off a cliff. To Tom's surprise, not only does he survive the fall without a scratch, he discovers that he now has incredible strength and can easily leap large distances. He destroys the lab, killing everyone but Dr. Wolfe who survived being buried in the rubble.

Returning to the city to look for work, Tom is almost struck by a car, but is saved by a young man by the name of Bud Pierce. Impressed by Pierce's brave deed and surprising strength, Tom offers to pool their resources to find work. Finding an ad looking for a lab assistant, Tom goes to apply for the position, only to find that Dr. Wolfe is alive and well. Wanting to strike fear in the heart of the Nazis, Tom makes himself a costume with a cape that allows him to glide through the air. Calling himself the American Eagle, Tom thwarts the Nazi plot with the help of Pierce. Pierce later makes his own costume and together Standish and Pierce fight criminals as American Eagle and Eaglet.
