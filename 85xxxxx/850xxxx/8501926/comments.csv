,Mothra67,2013-05-24T06:17Z,Thank you so much for keeping those going!!!  the only ones I am still seeding are the 1st 5 of my newst Uploads!!!  anything you can continue seeding is greatly appreciated!
,tpbbabu,2013-05-26T09:13Z,"dear Mothra67, 
i have grabbed ur UFO gold key comics.
and every evening with hot snacks im enjoying the UFO comics. They are super awesome :D

Think you can upload more UFO classics , if you can find any. . . How about this one - The Second Missile by Ed Earl Rupp
or any other if you can find . Thanks man."
,Penthesilea,2013-05-27T08:50Z,I have completed and am seeding all but 7 of your uploads. Ms. Victory Archive Complete! Golden Age (Rangerhouse06MSVictory.cbr) is the only one with no seeds at all. Any chance of a reseed? Thanks for all the good work. 
,tpbbabu,2013-05-29T06:14Z,"thanx for all the seeds Penthesilea,
can you seed Doll man and especially Frankenstien.

Getting poor speeds (0.3 to 3kbps) for franky :("
,Penthesilea,2013-05-29T09:53Z,"All the Mothra67 torrents except a few modern ones and Green Lama, Judomaster Charleston, La_Arana_Verde__2.cbr and Rangerhouse06MSVictory.cbr are complete and seeding.  Frankenstein 1946-1947 is healthy and available (ratio 4.7 in last two days).  I'm still waiting for the 4 named to complete. Miss Victory is dead, hasn't even started.  I'm surprised at the percentage of hit and runs on this content."
,Mothra67,2013-05-30T17:28Z,which is why I only seed for a few days then let the other DLers try to keep it going.  I just put up something new you all may be interested in though
