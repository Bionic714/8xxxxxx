I had no time, I was the Easter holiday.
Try this release on the virtual machine (I use VMware player) and tell your review.

I try to make new releases every month ... only have a very hard (high) competition on the part of marph78 and very, very few seders ... makes me sad ... and that makes me to stop make more release (I think about this!!!) :("
,lamportyx,2013-05-24T03:28Z,"lolzob have you deleted the ei.cfg on this ISO? if so these will become universal which will include.

homebasic
homepermuim
professional
ultimate"
,lolzob,2013-05-24T09:39Z,"@lamportyx 
I do not have deleted anything, it is original Windows.
Thanks for tip!"
,lolzob,2013-05-24T11:10Z,Seeds plz!
,U-235,2013-05-24T11:48Z,"@lolzob: Understood. I understand it's time consuming and that people don't seed enough (ungrateful pricks)... I don't know much about other releases except that some are Enterprise which I don't like since Windows Loader doesn't seem to work on them. I prefer your releases, especially when you could choose whether you want Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate. This is really handy actually and I think your releases stand out as you reply to our questions & feedback and all. :)

I will seed more this time, at least 200 GB. I know it's not much, but at least it's better than ""hit & running"" which seems popular and goes against the whole ""sharing is caring"" concept.

It would be a pitty if you stop doing these releases, but I understand why, I don't know if I would be able to carry on forever either, but know this; at least some of us are thankful for what you've done for the community."
,lolzob,2013-05-24T13:14Z,"@U-235
Thanks for your kind words and for all."
,lolzob,2013-05-25T11:41Z,After download please seed!
,lamportyx,2013-05-25T12:19Z,"ok tnx for these release i presume that this one is much better than the release of murphy, simply because your release is much faster on the final set up coz there is no installation.of other program is running."
,lolzob,2013-05-25T13:21Z,"@lamportyx 
I do not say nothing if this release is better than the release of murphy.
You must tell if it's good or bad!"
,lamportyx,2013-05-26T00:15Z,this is good than the release of murphy.
,progenx,2013-05-27T15:55Z,thx for this release
,U-235,2013-05-28T01:20Z,"Now I've seeded over 250 GB, so now somebody else have to take over. If everybody who download this would seed this until at least 2,0 in ratio even Pirate Bay would be prospering as a file sharing community. :)

I think the torrent is good by the way, I installed it a few days ago. I had a few problems though, but I don't think it has to do with this release, more like the drivers to my hardware. 

Thanks. :)"
,lolzob,2013-05-28T22:33Z,"@U-235
I thank you for everything!"

After you have installed look in:
Start - All Programs - Windows Update and you find Windows 7 Languege Packs"
,lalete31,2013-06-04T19:06Z,"Hey, i just burn a copy but in 98% of progress says that the system32configsystem folder does not exist. 

Is your torrent corrupt or something? Somebody else have the same problem?? Or I just burned it wrong?"
,lamportyx,2013-06-05T09:06Z,"on this release i just installed 15 PC in our Office!

because we dont have enough budget to purchased legit Windows 7! tnx very much!"
,lolzob,2013-06-07T11:54Z,"@lamportyx

,lolzob,2013-06-07T11:57Z,"@lamportyx

,lolzob,2013-06-07T12:00Z,"@lalete31
I think you are wrong somewhere!"
,lolzob,2013-06-07T12:04Z,seeds!
,lolzob,2013-06-07T13:07Z,"I do not understand!!!
In this moment uTorrent shows me the 144 seeds and thepiratebay shows me 95 seeders, why ? Anyone knows?
This happens about 2 weeks, before approximately 10-15 minutes thepiratebay was the same as uTorrent!"
,lolzob,2013-06-07T14:24Z,After download please seed!
