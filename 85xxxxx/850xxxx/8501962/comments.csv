1. I did not insulted you!!!
2. You can use 8 gb dvd.
3. But for higher speed, you can use the stick, you can delete it when you want and put new information on it.
4. You decide on what you give the money."

We hope at the beginning of 2014 people at Microsoft to release the SP1 ... so say some rumors ... and thus Windows 8 will be less than 4 gb."
