Please help. I have installed this version and when I activated the toolkit I got this message, Supported office installation was not detected in the system. Currently office is sitting in my programs file.

Your advice would be greatly appreciated. Keep up the great ups

Regards

This comment should be directed at MS Office ProPlus 2013 VL x86 en -US May 2013"

Then open admin prompt and navigate to your Office14 folder in program files_microsoft office

Then run:
cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:127.0.0.2
cscript ospp.vbs /setprt:1688
cscript ospp.vbs /act

That should work for any system you have if you can get the KSS to install."

The KMS Server Service would not highlight the INSTALL button in Office Toolkit 243.

Kind regards    Rod from New Zealand"

This guy seems to have leftovers from an x64 install confusing the MTK program. Office leaves a lot of junk behind when uninstalled..."
[V],murphy78,2013-05-24T05:40Z,"roadie, yer probably using xp if the buttons don't show up. You might try using kmspico or something..."

Kind regards as usual........Rod"
