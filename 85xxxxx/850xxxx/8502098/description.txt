First I converted the source from Retail to VL because you are
NEVER going to activate any Retail version without purchasing.
There would obviously be small periods where leaked keys could
be used to retail activate, but it would only work for a short
while before MS blocks the key. This is why we use VL for KMS
activation.

Then I added all the big MSP files into the updates folder.
The updates folder for the source already had sp1 msp files,
so I just needed to add ones for post-sp1 to satisfy MS Update.

I split the source into 2 different versions so people wouldn't
have to download both of them. They already had autorun info. I
didn't modify the source other than switch it to VL and add
updates. A lot of people from what I hear, recommend getting
32-bit version of Office 2010 because of all the plug-ins.
You can choose for yourself.

You can't simply toss the exe files from MS Download Center in the
folder, but you can extract those files with 7-zip and then copy
the en-US and the none.MSP files to there. You also have to
add any proofing spanish and french files or Update nags you.

And that's exactly what I've done. These are all of the MSP files
contained in MOST of the KB exe files available for download. There
are still a few ones that don't have any MSP file inside, but
they are very small. The non-MSP kb files total about 1-2megs on
Microsoft Download. Those, you can do yourself. I cannot
pre-integrate those without making a fully custom install using
a bunch of registry settings, task settings, services, etc.
Basically, just not gonna happen; would be a mistake to even try.
