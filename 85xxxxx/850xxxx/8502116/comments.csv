Should I run the KMSpico_Install_v3.2.exe file first and then install the actual software?  I've installed the software about a month or so ago and now I am getting a window that's telling me that I have three days before activation.  

Thanks!"

I meant to ask that if I install the KMSpico_Install_v3.2.exe file now, would it prevent the deactivation of the Office Pro 2013?  I could simply uninstall the software and start over again.  What would you recommend?"
