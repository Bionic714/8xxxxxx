
Designed by FlukeDuke - the creator of "The Impossible Game" - comes a fast-paced actiongame playable with two players on one device!

The games idea is as simple a addicting: You and 3 opponents are set in an arena which is haunted by a monster. Each player tries to be the last man standing using classical 2d-gameplay mechanics. By using different weapons like flash grenades, a monster potion (turning you into a monster), an ice-rifle or even an automatic laser you are fighting for your life over and over again.

Sci-Fighters presents itself in a comic-like 2d-style using different settings like ΓÇ£Martian MansionΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£Toxic ForestΓÇ¥. The game draws lovely animated characters and wonderful sceneries and background on the screen, designed by SuperFlashBros-genius Adam Vian.

Features:
- Classical 2d-gameplay with bizarre characters and beautiful animations
- Local 2-player-mode
- 7 different weapons
- Choose between touch-controls or virtual joypad
- HeyZap integration for achievements and leaderboards
