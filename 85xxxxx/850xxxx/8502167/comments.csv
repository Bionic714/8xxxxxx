,WillieInTheMist,2013-05-28T04:48Z,"Hate to be the one to spill the beans, but this is not the extended cut. You can tell right from the first 10 minutes. There is supposed to be a scene with McClane and his daughter having a conversation on the way to the airport that is not there."
,WillieInTheMist,2013-05-28T04:49Z,I do want to say though that this is a great copy and the subtitles are spot on which I had issues with on other copies. So great work :)
