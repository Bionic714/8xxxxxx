There is a forlorn and melancholy vibe hanging over Micky Braun these days. Listening to Raise My Glass, the latest studio album from his Texas-based band, Micky & The Motorcars,

ThereΓÇÖs a early Springsteen vibe going on on the title track, which launches Raise My Glass. Minor key guitars, an accordion, a steady beat, and a vocal performance from Braun that will break your heart. The pain is real, or at least Braun makes it sound real.

That brokenhearted feeling continues on ΓÇ£A Thousand TearsΓÇ¥ and that runs into ΓÇ£Any Longer Any More,ΓÇ¥ two songs that are side-by-side but are not as distinctive as they could be. I did like Kris FarrowΓÇÖs guitar solo on the latter track.

Fans of the Texas/Red Dirt sound will latch on to ΓÇ£Far From You.ΓÇ¥ And if you like the chilly roots-country of ΓÇ£Odessa Snow,ΓÇ¥ youΓÇÖre not alone ΓÇô itΓÇÖs a keeper!

BraunΓÇÖs vocal performance on slow-burning ballad ΓÇ£How Far IΓÇÖll GoΓÇ¥ is workmanlike, but decent.

The song that hits the hardest, though, is ΓÇ£Never Been Out West,ΓÇ¥ a bittersweet slice of country, complete with pedal steel and an interesting drum pattern from stickman Shane Vannerson.

VannersonΓÇÖs drums are mixed up front on the bold and rapid-fire ΓÇ£St. LucyΓÇÖs Eyes.ΓÇ¥ This song shows what MMC are truly capable of.

"This life I lead, it's not for the faint of heart," Micky Braun warns listeners. Rough out there on the road, methinks.

Gary Braun, rhythm guitarist for the Motorcars, takes lead vocals on ΓÇ£Big Casino,ΓÇ¥ a song he co-wrote with brother and Reckless Kelly frontman Willy Braun. In fact the song has a muscular Reckless Kelly feel to it. A beefy track, for sure.
