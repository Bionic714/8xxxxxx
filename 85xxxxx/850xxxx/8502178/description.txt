
In a secret lab, an evil scientist worked for years to create a formula that would give him extreme athletic powers - it didn't work out. So the formula sat alone in an empty warehouse, slowly mutating until it came to life and became Spunk and Moxie!

Help Spunk and Moxie escape in this classic-style platformer with a fresh new twist; one-touch input gives the player full control over sliding, jumping and bouncing through 30 levels across 3 visually stunning themes; The warehouse, Factory, and Laboratory.
