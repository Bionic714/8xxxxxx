I was going through some old tapes and found this on one of them. This was the November 1988 rebroadcast of Geraldo's infamous "Skinhead fight" episode from the week before. Geraldo invited three 20-something racist douchebags onto his show, berated them as "punks" when they called him "Jerry Rivers" (the name Geraldo supposedly used in college), which resulted in the inevitable chair-throwing brawl on the set that made all the Headlines.

This is the FULL episode, not just the fight scene. I removed all commercials but one because I found it so funny/dated... an ad for "US Videotel" selling a "home data terminal" with built-in B/W screen, chicklet keyboard and 300 Baud modem (5 years before the internet.)

Enjoy!
