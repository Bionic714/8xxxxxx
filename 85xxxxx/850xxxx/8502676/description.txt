RP Boo  a.k.a Kavain was born in West Chicago and moved to the Southside in the 80s. Like many of footwork's originators, he was brought through into production through associations with the legendary House and Juke dance clique House-O-Matics, DJing alongside DJ Deeon and DJ Milton, then getting shown how to produce by DJ Slugo. The machine Kavain learnt to produce on was a display model of the Roland R-70, a drum machine which gave access to all previous Roland drum sounds and the ability to punch in rhythms on the fly, it's the machine he still uses today.

RP Boo's music is singular and unusual in Footwork, featuring raps and dialogue adopted from Juke, often in combination with sharp-edged and incidental samples giving some tracks a paranoid atmosphere. Take '187 Homicide's bleak feeling and question and answer vocals, "Area 72" alien landing scenario or "Speaker's R-4" audio walk-through. His music is often hectic, seemingly built to to almost psyche-out the listener or offer challenges to dancers; itΓÇÖs this playful and imaginative quality, along with his sometimes baffling-but-it-works rhythms and sub, that give RP's tracks their totally unique feel.
