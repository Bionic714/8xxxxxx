,m0n0lyth,2013-05-24T20:52Z,I am also getting the quickfontcache.dll error and can not run the program.  W7x64Ult
,ecto_octo,2013-05-29T04:44Z,"The 11.0.0 version from ChingLiu's torrents worked for me.  I installed this one again after I installed that one and it still works, although my version now says 11.0.1   I was a bit sleepy while installing, I might have installed the 11.0.1 version, but I'm 85% sure I installed this one.  Anyway, after installing the 11.0.0 version I didn't get any quickfontcache.dll errors.  Thanks!"
