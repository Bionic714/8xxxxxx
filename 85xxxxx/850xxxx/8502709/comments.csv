i have a question for you, how come you've never encoded The Matrix trilogy in 1080p...
yes there are copies available for this movie,but your encoding settings are perfect for this kind of high voltage action films...
It's not a request(WELL IF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE THEN MAKE IT A REQUEST :) ;) ), just hope that one day you will consider it...
fantastic work in Bad Education and All about My Mother..thnx for doing them!!!"
