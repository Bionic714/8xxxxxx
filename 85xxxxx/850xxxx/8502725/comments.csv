,cakemafia,2013-05-24T11:17Z,You've been reported and your welcome :D
[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-24T16:32Z,"@cakemafia: Upload all the dupes you like if you think that's a useful contribution to TPB. Personally, I prefer not to upload things that are already available (though I have to admit I sometimes forget to search first before adding a new torrent)."
,cakemafia,2013-05-24T18:42Z,"Oops

[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-25T06:40Z,"@cakemafia: Yes, but as you can see in the comments, I apologize for the dupe in case someone is kindly pointing out it's a dupe."
,cakemafia,2013-05-25T08:30Z,"Okay.. enough.. Fuck you and horse you rode in on.. If you have a problem... Report it.. 

If u don't like dupes then feel free to delete your own torrents.. Stay away from mine.."
[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-25T09:50Z,"@cakemafia: What's there to report? If you're gonna upload dupes to TPB, you can expect people to point that out in the comments. Get used to it or find a different torrent site where dupes are appreciated. Note that on many torrent sites they will even ban you completely if you repeatedly insist on uploading dupes."
,cakemafia,2013-05-25T11:46Z,"Awesome.. Delete Your OWN ""DUPE"" Torrents and then we'll talk. Till then FUCK OFF!!!

,Burro78,2013-05-26T02:09Z,"@dohduhdah, don't get too upset. cakemafia's isn't a complete dupe. His doesn't include the course guide that yours did. "
[V],bizkitboy,2013-05-26T08:43Z,"Calm your tits ladies.. TPB is a free site.. Anyone can upload whatever the hell they want as long as they are within the rules of the site..

@dohduhdah: if there's nothing to report then what ur doing is called spamming.. whether what cakemafia is doing is right or wrong.. its none of your business..

goodbye ladies.. don't scratch each other.. and btw.. thanx for the upload.. good stuff.. :D"
[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-26T11:17Z,"Well, I'm not saying dupes are not allowed on tpb or that those dupes should be deleted. I'm just pointing out that it might be a good idea to search first. Surely people have the freedom to mention something is a dupe in the comments just like other people have the freedom to upload dupes?"
,The_Abee,2013-05-26T11:18Z,"play nice guys, please. 

dupes don't cause anything btw. but the real uploader must put a reference link to dohduhdah's post if he thinks he has downloaded from him ( as a intial uploader ). Yet, it's an open site so everything is quite a fair here. dupe, spam etc. "
[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-26T11:31Z,"Dupes do cause something. If you have 3 dupes of a torrent, you will not be able to download it as fast as you could if there was only one version of that torrent and the downloaders/seeders would all be working together. It doesn't have to be a big deal for well-seeded torrents, but why waste upload bandwidth on something when you could spend it on something useful like uploading it to an alternative torrent site where it's still unavailable?"
[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-26T11:48Z,The whole point of torrents is making content available more efficiently by collectively downloading/uploading and dupes are dividing the group of people who are uploading/downloading a particular piece of content. It's annoying when people are asking to re-seed past uploads because of a lack of seeders and that is more likely to happen in case of duplicitous content that disperses the seeders over several torrents offering identical content.
[V],bizkitboy,2013-05-26T13:42Z,"@dohduhdah: Dude.. 

01. your sounding like an MPAA lawyer.. Calm ur tits boy.. its free site and a free world.. cake has given u permission to report him like he has reported you.. do that..

02. rite now ur just seeming like a little girl screaming foul.. but sadly enough he has done nothing wrong so even i, as a third person, cant tell him anything..

03. clearly everyone makes mistakes, like you have uploaded a dupe yourself, why don't you delete that.. only seems fair since you've posted over 7 comments on someone else's page for something, that cannot be provin as 'foul play'...

04. GROW UP!!!! many folks have uploaded dupes of what i've done and sometimes even i end up uploading dupes of others.. that doesn't give anybody the right to spam anyone's torrent page...

05. If ur expecting an apology from cake.. then shame on you cos he's just an uploader like you or me.. who uploads cos he wants to share somehing and takes time out from his own day..

p.s. I'm gonna make any more comments on this page since its not my torrent.. and i'm gonna request you girls to get over it.."
[V],dohduhdah,2013-05-26T14:15Z,@bizkitboy: Pointing out a torrent is a dupe is not spam. It's a legitimate comment (check the guidelines for reporting comments at suprbay) and this whole discussion would have been avoided if cakemafia didn't get upset about a legit comment on this torrent.
,The_Abee,2013-05-28T10:00Z,Yes man I appreciate your spirit of torrenting but you can't change the others. It's an open site having no rules(about dupes) so that's it.
