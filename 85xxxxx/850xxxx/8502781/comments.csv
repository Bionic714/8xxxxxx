SEE.. that's how it's done.. give info about the release.. "
,contour1,2013-05-26T05:52Z,"   The genesis of all these HDSCR, HDRIP, DVDRIP, R^, etc.. is an HD CAM version from China.. it has been dubbed back into English.. there is no such thing as an R6 release or a screener at this point.. however.. it's funny to see how many ""youngsters"" to the scene that dont even know how to label a release..   and don't get them started on what makes a TS."
