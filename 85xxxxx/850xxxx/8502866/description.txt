Caroline Quentin's National Parks
In a new series Caroline Quentin visits three of Britain's most popular national parks. The actress and presenter is celebrating areas of outstanding natural beauty around Britain, partly by bombarding us with facts (the loch is 600 ft deep, the park covers 700 square miles, and so on), and partly by doing that thing presenters have to do, trying her hand at everything - ceilidh dancing, caber-tossing and in one of the less thrilling sequences, counting bats at dusk. She rings barn owl chicks and takes a rainy swim in the loch and has a terrific time.




2)  Snowdonia National Park 
This episode finds her in Wales at the Snowdonia National Park. Famous for its spectacular scenery, it covers over 800 square miles. Snowdon is the tallest mountain in the principality and climbing and hiking are popular activities here - but this beautiful landscape can also be treacherous. Caroline volunteers to take part in a training exercise for the Mountain Rescue Dogs Association which is run entirely by volunteers, local people who will drop everything to help anyone who gets into trouble. The mountain is famous for its 50-mile narrow-gauge railway and every August the annual Race the Train contest attracts over 2,000 runners. Caroline is in her element as she starts the race and cheers on the competitors.
