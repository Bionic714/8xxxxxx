This pack includes the original SpellForce: The Order of Dawn and both the expansions SpellForce: The Breath of Winter and SpellForce Shadow of the Phoenix.


Once downloaded, simply extract Spellforce.exe and set game compatability to Windows XP SP3. Then run the game in Admin mode.

When asked the serial key is:

If this doesn't work you should be able to find one on google (but it should work)










Enjoy and have fun :)
