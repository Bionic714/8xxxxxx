,tflagger997,2013-05-24T00:57Z,"Wow, a seed to leech ratio of 198.92!  That is a new record.

People, listen up.  If you all try to DL at the same time from a few seeds it will take a week or more.  Once leechers is greater than 10 x Seeders you just have to wait.  So put your torrents on pause, and let a few (hundred) people DL this torrent.  You will probably end up getting it faster than if you tried to 'win the race'.

I know - no one is going to listen, but I had to try.  

Thanks YIFY for a 1080p at a very reasonable size!"
,obvious2me,2013-05-24T11:10Z,"198.92 is ridiculously good... You should be able to download at max rate with that... Are you drunk? Am I drunk?

Anyway, this is a YIFY upload; 1.6 GB is downloaded very quickly by many people even with the initial ""I must have this"" surge (No real point in waiting).

Thanks YIFY."
,BioBrain,2013-05-24T17:27Z,I hope my thanks & seeding is enough :)
,tflagger997,2013-05-24T19:43Z,"For 5153 to have DLd this in the last day, YIFY is either on an Internet Trunk all to themselves, or else the numbers displayed on TPB are very, very wrong.  Anywho, thanks again YIFY!"
,rockdood27,2013-05-24T22:36Z,"This does not have built in subs. The subs that yify provides contain misspelled words. Lame. 

v-10
a-10
m-4"
,FBInot,2013-05-25T04:00Z,"who the fk has the built in subs ?? every fcking one I have downloaded is with out them and the fcking movie is 60% stupid ass russian  and you cant know what the fck they are saying. This site use to be a good place to get a good movie, going down the toilet"
,wizzard4all,2013-05-25T04:13Z,"@""rockdood"" Ya know what's REALLY lame? Douchebags coming on here whining about subtitle files instead of just enjoying the movie. AND you call yourself ""rockdood"" and you have the nerve to bitch about misspelled words???? 
You can download sub files from anywhere... #LOSER"
,tflagger997,2013-05-25T05:30Z,"Having to rewind, pause, and turn the subs on an off was a bit of a wank job, but does not make this any worse than it already is.  Hell some of the scenes were filmed with handycams!

I will not post spoilers.

This thing makes #4 look like Oscar material.  The end is mind-numbingly stupid you will wish you had skipped this one.  So do not worry about the Russian words, they do nothing for you except make you wonder why the second half of this movie took place at all.  Make sure you have lowered your expectations (and had a few drinks) before watching this.

Now I need to go roofie myself, and try to erase the memory of such a good series turning to pure crap.  The first and third are still classics, but this is the exact opposite.  3/10 (many, many, mistakes in the plot, bad script, bad directing, half-assed acting - what little there is, and virtually no Die Hard Music!!!)."
,jaybee211,2013-05-25T11:16Z,"Here's a link to the English subs for Russian Speaking parts only.
Will work with any Die Hard 5 extended cut version
As long as the Duration is 1.41.11

Cheers."
,unoimgr8st,2013-05-25T13:48Z,Is the audio 2.0 or 5.1?
,naj01,2013-05-25T19:36Z,"it says on wikipedia that mclane meets his daughter in the end //// 
ithought this was the extended version .... wheres that scene ?"
,longjohnshane,2013-05-26T15:21Z,"""SUBTITLES.......: English"" That line is a lie, no subs.. very disappointing... At this point it should be standard to include subtitles at least for the foreign language parts of movies."
,firexninja,2013-05-27T08:19Z,thank you!
,maniaq77,2013-05-27T10:17Z,"the version I saw AT THE CINEMA has his daughter meet him at the airport just before he gets on the plane for Russia - says something like ""try not screw everything up""

if she is not in this version then how THE FUCK do you call this an ""extended"" version?

what else is missing?

think I'll wait for a PROPER"
,funseeker521,2013-05-27T17:41Z,@naj01 how is he going to meet his daughter at the end dumbass? She plays a supporting role in an earlier movie in the franchise and in this one she drops him off at the airport. At least I think that's his daughter since she calls him dad.
,pawn3d,2013-05-27T22:24Z,"@tflagger997 the reason the ratio is fucked up is because people are trying to do you a favor by deleting this garbage... 

We don't want 5 billion copies of this crap out there."
,Kreg_87,2013-06-01T03:51Z,Whats up with the Picture boii.. totally waste of time to download this vid yo!!
,tonethebone,2013-06-08T23:48Z,"This upload looks good.  the srt file mentioned below works fine with this.  all audio is in sync with video and the russian translation to english appears at the correct time and is the only text that apears after conversion.  I converted to mpg using TotalVideoConverter adding the srt before conversion.  A=9, V=9  good job yify!!"
,Messenger25,2013-06-09T07:57Z,I don't get it... Why some YIFY 1080p BrRip works in my TV and some won't play with a cannot play playback something warning
