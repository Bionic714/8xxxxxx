,joetwawa,2013-05-25T18:59Z,YIFY - Keep up the good work ! Would it be impolite to ask if you can't provide with multi-channel sound ? Your uploads are great but the lack of MC sound sometimes disappoints
,t5352,2013-05-25T20:41Z,yify u r the best...u r amazing..
,lebullstud,2013-05-27T01:15Z,"Thank you again YIFY for another great upload.
A10/10, V10/10, M10/10.
Can't ask for more!"
,firexninja,2013-05-27T08:20Z,thank you! movie's alright...but thanks for the upload! parents wanna watch it..haha
,rupert3k,2013-05-27T12:12Z,"notgamy82: bitrate is irrelevant when it comes to yify, he produces the best quality possible in the smallest size, you either trust him & are yify loyal or you don't. You say it won't cost him anything, errr...  it'll cost him the time it takes to check the bitrate & type it, frankly I'd rather he spend that time relaxing or encoding. joetwawa: yify achieves his legendary file size by omitting surround & focussing on picture quality. People who want DTS download MKV's. Files of this size aren't possible with surround & this picture quality."
,serafeimkon,2013-05-27T15:11Z,thx YIFY ευχαριστω~~
,Dirzo,2013-05-28T05:38Z,Great work as always YIFY :) thanks a lot!
,Megadethl,2013-05-29T14:13Z,THANKS DUDE !
,doozerdoozer,2013-05-30T01:43Z,Is this actually good quality?
,n00berman,2013-05-30T20:47Z,Yes this is actually good quality (especially compared to their 720p release). 10/10 A/V
,Jimmy_Grizz,2013-06-01T00:06Z,"V=10
A=8 (except in the loud action parts, then its a 3)
M=7

YIFI is great video quality, but the audio is sub par.  I know that better audio would equal larger file, but to wait an extra 30 mins wouldn't kill anyone.  I've searched for the MKV version of this movie and it's slim pickings, with barely any seeders.  Even though the sound quality is poor, I still choose YIFI becasue it's trusted."
,Balsamous,2013-06-04T10:44Z,THX YiFy you are the besy
,sandance,2013-06-06T07:41Z,"thank you so much..
--will come back to rate"
,sandance,2013-06-06T18:37Z,"A/V 10
great quality as always
YIFY the best!"
,m80thebrawler,2013-06-07T00:53Z,"bad216 no it isnt out till the 8th
megodtoo your a fucktard, you can only preorder on amazon right now, learn how to do your research"
,BOSS_MODE,2013-06-11T22:47Z,"for any fans of L Frank Baum's classic I'm doing a fan edit of this movie to take out some of the punchlines and artificial segments, make it more pure fantasy."
