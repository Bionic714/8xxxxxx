,obvious2me,2013-05-24T10:59Z,If you can afford a 5.1 system you can afford a decent pair of tower speakers that run 2.1 at a mid-quality 5.1 setup.

,akwfla,2013-05-24T18:58Z,"Hey, you are so freaking awesome. Your torrents are perfection. I was wondering if you ever have time to possibly do The Phantom of the Opera?
If not, its cool. Much appreciated bro!"

,chewslab,2013-05-25T04:20Z,it's just a shame that your files are only in stereo. I agree with Luy1589. if you rip the audio in 5.1 surround it would barely effect the file size and your rips would be unbeatable! 
,Vorrrz,2013-05-26T02:25Z,Its a free BD rip so shut the fuck up and stop complaining. other wise go and buy it

,Qlix0804,2013-05-26T08:29Z,"Normally Id have no problem with YIFY uploads, lately though the sound has been unbearable. Ive tried it through multiple outputs to verify that its not a hardware issue. It is only YIFY uploads as of late that sound like garbage to me. 

I appreciate all the work that is put into getting these uploaded, and im not compaining... free is free... just pointing out that there has been a shift in sound quality on my end. 

What i notice is a crackling and popping type noise during periods of loud or intense action on the screen for example Wiches green crackling lightning shooting out of her hands... makes my shit explode. Have ran through multiple sets of speaker, again, verifying that its not a hardware issue. 

I typically use VLC for everything i watch. Is it possible that somehow i jacked with a setting somewhere? I find it unlikely as everything else i watch is fine.

Again thanks for the work... hoping for a fix!"
,happynick,2013-05-26T14:25Z,I rate the movie with a weak 2 (1-5) 5 is top notch... Really bad!

,wmillsw,2013-06-02T17:31Z,"The pirate bay HD-movies section is completly ruined because YIFY shitty rips. Now if you want to see a HD-movie you have to come and shift trough the shit. YIFY rips are in the same section of REAL HD-movies how can this be? Please someone moderate this. Stop uploading this crap here, put it on movies, not fucking here"
,Rexdango,2013-06-03T05:21Z,"Good rip! Played on Ps3, and it doesn't even come out until the 4th, cheers! :p"

,LadyBot,2013-06-13T08:12Z,"Thanks for the awesome torrent, YIFY!!

This movie made me laugh. I was expecting less from it but it was worth watching.

I give the movie an 8. Enjoy."
