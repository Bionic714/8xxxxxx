Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, May 23 broadcast of The Alex Jones Show, Alex examines the UK's latest "terror attack" on the streets of London and its role in propping up the perpetual War on Terror, as US and UK governments work in concert to support Al-Qaeda-affiliated 'rebels' in Syria. 

Alex also continues breaking down the influx of scandals hitting the Obama Administration, and discusses new details surrounding radio host Adam Kokesh's detainment. 

On today's show, Alex speaks with former presidential nominee of the Constitution Party, co-author of Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission and the founder and former pastor of Crossroad Baptist Church in Florida, Chuck Baldwin. Today, we'll also air our groundbreaking exclusive interview with film and animation pop culture icon Mike Judge.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
