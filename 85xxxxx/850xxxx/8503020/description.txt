so controversial  children killing children

Episode 4 was pulled from the schedule in the aftermath of the Newtown massacre and just before the Boston Marathon bombings. Portions of Episode 4 are available online as a Web series on NBC.com (http://www.nbc.com/hannibal/video/categories/web-series/736808/). The webisodes will serve as a bridge between Episode 3 & 5. (The full version of the episode will air outside the U.S. -- However, I do not know when or where.) Related new articles...
