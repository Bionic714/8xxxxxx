Emotive. Passionate. Intelligent. Hard working. These are terms that just begin to describe Bravo Delta, a four piece modern rock band whose music has been labeled "subjective and emotive yet irrepressibly accessible". Big hooks and radio-ready polish, with ΓÇ£a dark undercurrent of cut-throat exasperationΓÇ¥ that can leave a listener singing, dancing, or thinking. In a very short time, the project has matured and evolved from one manΓÇÖs idea to a full fledged modern rock powerhouse, producing a sound that one media publication calls ΓÇ£a ten out of tenΓÇªan A+ΓÇ¥.
