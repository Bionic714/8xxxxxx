,dandalis,2013-05-24T11:24Z,"another useless update, still no perfomance increases -__-"
,x1911,2013-05-24T16:32Z,"New fixes:

- Fixed problem with Mountaineer, Sure-Shot, and Demolition outfits not properly unlocking when no other DLC is installed.
- Fixed TressFX Hair not being able to be turned on, on some machines, when using AMD Eyefinity or NVIDIA Surround.
- Significant performance improvements in CPU limited areas, for example in Shanty Town. (This is the same fix we have previously exposed to users on forums with the MulticoreFlushMode registry key).
- Fixed water polygons randomly disappearing on Intel graphics hardware.
- Fix problem with English VO setting when playing in Japanese not properly being remembered after a restart.
- Minor UI improvements.

Players on NVIDIA hardware we recommend using the 320.0 BETA or more recent drivers, which contain several driver fixes related to Tomb Raider."
