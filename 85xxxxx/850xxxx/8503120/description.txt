Best-selling author and lifelong martial artist Joseph Simonet takes individual training to the next, necessary step: a two-person, full-contact drill that is easy to learn, combines the best elements of the most effective combat arts currently known and has application for any fighting situation you may find yourself facing. He teaches you how to control the fight from the first instant, disrupting your opponent's rhythm and keeping him so off-balance that he'll have no time to react. Simonet also provides vital instruction on the supported elbow frame, an all-purpose defense that allows you to take even the strongest of blows without injury.
