Apparently, most peers are stuck at the same level. What the hell? The trackers seem to be the same as for days 12 and 13, which download fine."
,AmaFan,2013-05-26T11:50Z,"Still no download of the complete file.

Bum_Fluff, could it be that you changed the Natsu2013 11 E.mp4 file while seeding (like correcting a typo in it)? I checked everything and found that my uTorrent banned your IP for hashfail on piece #315."
,AmaFan,2013-05-26T12:48Z,"To be clear, the hashfail + auto-ban on piece #316 happened repeatedly after re-launching the torrent client. I just tried that again, three times, and now each time it happened with piece #316."
