,89t89,2013-05-24T05:13Z,thanks. if you dont mind me asking why divx format? isnt it the worst quality - out of rifftrax options - and only slightly smaller in file size?
,saybis,2013-05-24T05:25Z,"Well the largest file they have for download is usually around 3gbs and is .mpg format. I feel that the divx format is a little more user friendly and the smaller file size seems to be fairly popular. 
If you want any other kind of format I will gladly upload them, they come in mp4 and mpg."
,Frangleesh,2013-05-25T13:53Z,Interesting piece of cinematic history completely vandalized through added voice-over comments by two mindless adolescents who seem to think they're amusing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING THIS ADULTERATED VERSION. Seek out the real thing.

,89t89,2013-05-26T23:40Z,Ait. If its not too much a hassle can you upload the mpg of your Psycho II torrent? 
,saybis,2013-05-27T01:25Z,No problem at all
,SOPASUX,2013-05-28T23:33Z,"I've been waiting for this, but could we get the MPG-2 or .MP4 for iPad version9s) of this, pretty please? Thanks!"
,SOPASUX,2013-05-28T23:39Z,"Frangleesh is quite special, isn't he?

Thanks for the torrent GMT. If you're able to torrent the high rez .mp4 of this plz, that would be great. Thanks!"
