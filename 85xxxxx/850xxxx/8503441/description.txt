This disables the annoying unlocked DLC content from the SKIDROW Saints Row The Third release, you can choose to keep the less intrusive ones.

I found this after some long searches and it works very good on the repack version by SKIDROW.




-Pasted below is the original Readme which is included in the rar. -


SO like yeah the DLCS were fooked up.
So like i fixed the skidrow exes a bit for a friend cause i'd never pirate a game evar.

So quick and simple.

NODLCS folder

NO DLCs enabled / no preorder content at all

ChangedDLCS folder, has these changes

Disabled bonus $$/respect on start
Disabled bonus hourly/weekly $
Disabled other bonus money drop related shit (i think npcs dropped more $ or something).
Disabled VTOL/SaintsTank etc (VTOL is what instantly takes over areas)
Kept all outfits + homies + weapon packs + preorder packs i could.

If your dumb so you know the 'invincible' dlc doesnt make anything invincible,
unless you turn on the cheats the dlc unlocks, the dlc just unlocks cheats in the cheats menu, which is in phone somewhere.
Turning on any cheats in the cheats menu will make your save game dirty, (marked as cheated).
Just having them unlocked with the dlc does nothing 'bad', good to have them unlocked for when you get bored... like that can happen.
