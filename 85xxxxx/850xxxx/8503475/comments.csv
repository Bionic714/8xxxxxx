,mr_clock,2013-05-24T03:54Z,Not sure if this one has the crack or not (I got 008 from the forum as well). If not the crack from here https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8495274/Project_Zomboid_Cracking_Tutorial will work.
,ForbiddenSoul,2013-05-24T16:18Z,"Thanks again Easipak!

Here's Just the crack if anyone wants it.

,vegeta0585,2013-05-24T20:32Z,"Little confused. I can unpack the game and run it (albeit in 32 bit mode only) however...this isn't the whole game. Where is story mode? The tutorial to save Kate? etc etc? It's just sandbox and survival modes, and looks like an older build."
,Easipak,2013-05-24T20:50Z,"The latest ten builds or so do not contain story mode. NPC's aren't in those either, they are probably fixing these features later. This is the most recent released build at this moment, I assure you."
,Nemesysbr,2013-05-26T13:37Z,Why doesn't the 64 bit exe work?
,Easipak,2013-05-26T21:22Z,"I don't know nemesysbr, I use the 32bit version. Have you tried cracking it? And have you checked out theindiestone forum? I did not touch this, this is straight off the forum."
,binoklis,2013-05-29T00:53Z,"If You like this game, BUY IT. This game really deserves all your support."
,lords43,2013-06-02T17:34Z,"@binoklis

If I had money to spend on video games I wouldn't be in TPB would I?"
,Easipak,2013-06-03T00:44Z,"Agreed lords. I haven't bought the game yet, but I surely will. And just like with FTL and Don't Starve, it's a play now buy later scenario for me. The PZ crew deserves every penny, but only when I'm flushed with cash again."
,darksurfer,2013-06-05T15:11Z,"Quick question, does it work on Linux?"
,Easipak,2013-06-05T18:53Z,"PZ is a Windows, Mac, Linux game. Let me ask you this however, since my dad is so proud of his Ubuntu: are you satisfied with Wine? (Coincidentally, I'm enjoying some Vino and Porro right now, as it is my birthday.)"
