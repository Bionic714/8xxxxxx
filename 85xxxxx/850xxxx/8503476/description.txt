   Introduction to Programming Using Python is intended for use in the       
   introduction to programming course. Daniel Liang is known for his         
   fundamentals-first approach to teaching programming concepts and          
   techniques. Fundamentals-first means that students learn fundamental      
   programming concepts like selection statements, loops, and functions,     
   before moving into defining classes. Students learn basic logic and       
   programming concepts before moving into object-oriented programming,      
   and GUI programming. Another aspect of Introduction to Programming        
   Using Python is that in addition to the typical programming examples      
   that feature games and some math, Liang gives an example or two early     
   in the chapter that uses a simple graphic to engage the students.         
   Rather than asking them to average 10 numbers together, they learn the    
   concepts in the context of a fun example that generates something         
   visually interesting. Using the graphics examples is optional in this     
   textbook. Turtle graphics can be used in Chapters 1-5 to introduce the    
   fundamentals of programming and Tkinter can be used for developing        
   comprehensive graphical user interfaces and for learning                  
   object-oriented programming.
