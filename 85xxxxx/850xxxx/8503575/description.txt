Collection of the serenity comic series released by Dark Horse in conjunction with Joss Whedon.
Had a bitch of a time getting copies that worked and were compatible with my reader and all other functionality.

Those Left Behind - Issues 1-3 are in .pdf format
Rest are .cbr (.cbz for shepard's tale)
Removed horrendous adverts from the .pdf's
