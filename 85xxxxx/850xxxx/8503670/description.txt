	I set up this pack for people who might be new to the andriod community. It has all of the most popular hacks and mods along with simple explained out instructions. I didn't create any of the programs nor did I come up with any of these methods. I just organized them and put simple instructions in each folder so that everything would be in one place and to simplify the process for some of the newer memebers who this is there first time messing around with any device.

This includes:

SAMSUNG_USB_Driver_for_Mobile_Phones
i337RootDebloatInstall 2 by hfxzack
Bloat Remover by Nottach
Nottachs S4MDL Deodexed Pseudo-Rom
Information about Nottachs Xposed Mod
Xposed Framework installer by rovo89
Original firmware dump and Odin recovery Instructions by AdamOutler
Comes with Nottachs APK Tools; APK Manager, BaksmaliManager, and Dex2Jar

Thanks to all the devs pushing out the hard work and can't wait to add a bootloader unlock to this pack.
