Looks pretty fine on a big screen television.  I watched it through last night and found that the audio was still muffled at parts because it it the English line audio, but still very watchable compared to some of the other copies out there.  This doesn't differ too much from the other copies labeled as (HDSCR) from 720p.HDSCR.ULTRA.EDiTiON.Hive-CM8 source."
