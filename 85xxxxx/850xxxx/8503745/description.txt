This is Chronological X-Men - Post AvX to X-Termination.

This set has been mostly ready for two months, IΓÇÖve just been waiting for a specific issue to drop, X-Factor 256.  This pack covers allot of ground, but not everything I would have liked.  Various Wolverine story lines are waiting to finish, as well as some other plots.

I am a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and really enjoy reading runs of comics rather than as they come out month by month.  I have gone with the highest rez, best looking versions of each issue that I could come up with.  
My ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  I am trying to follow all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they appear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in an Avengers title, I include it, but if no mutants are included in a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool to be part of the mutant family, so you will see his stuff here also.  I think the orders here work pretty well, but you can reorder stuff as you see fit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues I might have missed let me know.  I will try to work them in.

These are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks that turn out such amazing scans and you will find most scans are tagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.

These issues are from the Marvel Universe with various authors and illustrators.
Issues are all from 2012 and 2013.

The format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the language is ENGLISH
