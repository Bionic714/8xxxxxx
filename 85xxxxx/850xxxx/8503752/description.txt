Ever imaginative, this album features new arrangements of rare and unusual traditional songs such as Lord Levett. Cathy Jordan refashioned this poignant lyric by writing a new melody and asking the superb Triona Ni Dhomhnaill to play harpsichord. Jordan also sings a spine-tingling rendition of Suzanne Vegas’ The Queen and the Soldier. The results are enchanting. Newly composed material, Crucán na bPáiste by Brendan Graham and Grainne by Nashville song-writer Sharon Vaughan and Cathy Jordan, is tender and moving; while My Bride and I is a hauntingly enigmatic tale written by Canadian Dan Frechette, featuring Steve Wickam’s skillful string arrangement.
