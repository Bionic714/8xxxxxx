u can apply straight on game, u dont need update 1, and from what i cant tell, the game with this is quiet an improvement, had a bit of stutters, nothing now, played like till the bridge blows up (down:) and got error, now with the patch i played like i dont know 2hrs or so and NO problem at all,games working like a charm and its fun too, upgrading ur items, or gems or whatever they called, the conversations monsters the whole feel of graphics and the music, its just feels great to play it, i dont know but a great ARPG i think"
,XtraZoom,2013-05-25T04:22Z,Update 1 & 2 are 1.0.0.1 can you give us update 3 for 1.0.0.2? I would appreciate it greatly :)
,pairet89,2013-05-25T09:29Z,I used it on steam-rip version and its working fine. No need for the crack too. just update and play
,IcemanSR,2013-05-25T12:55Z,update 1 wasnt complete!it was missing all this files.it containted only sounds.and game version didnt changed it was 1.0.0.0 update 2 is proper update which unlcudes update 1 within and is same as reloaded release
,everx7,2013-05-25T13:41Z,"dunno about this update but reloaded is 238mb when unpacked, this is 183mb, so dunno whats missing, as i said before, nothing wrong with this patch but somethings missing, at least from what i can tell, but i didnt notice anything significant while playing the game"
