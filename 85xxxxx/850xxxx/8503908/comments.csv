This is a great  example of ""Useful Idiots"" at work.

This way we can learn how to live in a prison and be happy about it!"

,Martian14,2013-05-25T12:28Z,"Exactly!
Because, in Cuba one does not own a house, doctor bills are nonexistent because medical care is incipient at best...

If Cuba is so good, why people are locked inside the island, like a gulag????"

Who says that they're locked? The imperialist media of the capitalist countries... To know if they're locked or not, you need to hear the cubans, not what their enemies say.

Anyway, the comments section is to comment the torrent, not to discuss the theme of the torrent. So, I'll not engage in this discussion, bye. And I recommend that you go to a forum."
