The trio of tenor saxophonist Assif Tsahar (who doubles on bass clarinet),
Moore-Cooper (listed as playing diddley-bow, twanger, and ashimba, all of which
sound suspiciously like a string bass), and drummer Hamid Drake communicate
well on this set of nine free improvisations. Tsahar has a huge tone and even
when the music is at its freest, his passionate sound is
attractive. Moore-Cooper and Hamid Drake listen closely and react immediately
to Tsahar's ideas, often inspiring the tenorman to follow their musical
directions; this is very much a three-way conversation. Listeners are advised
to ignore the rather ugly cover drawing of Lost Brother and enjoy the powerful
and often-intense music.
