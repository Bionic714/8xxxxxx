Caroline Quentin's National Parks
In a new series Caroline Quentin visits three of Britain's most popular national parks. The actress and presenter is celebrating areas of outstanding natural beauty around Britain, partly by bombarding us with facts (the loch is 600 ft deep, the park covers 700 square miles, and so on), and partly by doing that thing presenters have to do, trying her hand at everything - ceilidh dancing, caber-tossing and in one of the less thrilling sequences, counting bats at dusk. She rings barn owl chicks and takes a rainy swim in the loch and has a terrific time.


1)  Loch Lomond 
The first episode finds her at Loch Lomond and the Trossachs in the South West of Scotland. The park covers over 700 square miles and she takes a trip by sea-plane over the lakes and mountains, including Loch Lomond itself. At Inveraray Castle's annual highland games Caroline enjoys the roast salmon and mussels on offer and even tries her hand at tossing the caber. On the island of Inchcailloch she joins a group of volunteers for a night monitoring the bats that live there. The park is also home to 61 protected bird species, including ospreys, golden eagles and peregrine falcons, and Caroline helps the park rangers to tag a nest of barn owl chicks. Before leaving she even manages a dip in the icy waters of Loch Lomond and gets on her dancing shoes to take part in a ceilidh.

2)  Snowdonia National Park 
This episode finds her in Wales at the Snowdonia National Park. Famous for its spectacular scenery, it covers over 800 square miles. Snowdon is the tallest mountain in the principality and climbing and hiking are popular activities here - but this beautiful landscape can also be treacherous. Caroline volunteers to take part in a training exercise for the Mountain Rescue Dogs Association which is run entirely by volunteers, local people who will drop everything to help anyone who gets into trouble. The mountain is famous for its 50-mile narrow-gauge railway and every August the annual Race the Train contest attracts over 2,000 runners. Caroline is in her element as she starts the race and cheers on the competitors.

3)  New Forest National Park 
In the final programme of the series, Caroline visits the New Forest, situated in the counties of Hampshire and Wiltshire. It is known for its ancient woods, open heaths, beautiful coastline and abundance of wild animals, although at just 218 square miles, it is one of the smallest of the 15 National Parks. In the heart of the National Park is the Pig Hotel, once a Royal hunting lodge. Gary Evely is a forager and it is his job to gather the food that grows wild in the forest so that it can be served in the restaurant just a few hours later. Caroline joins him to search and they stumble across an unusual beefsteak mushroom.
