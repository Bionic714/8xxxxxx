go to the app directory i.e.(C:Program FilesYouWave Android)

scroll down you will see that ""YouWave Android.exe"" you need to change the name to ""YouWave_Android""

After changing then run the patch as administrator and and apply it

On applying it will pop up again and say ""Can not find the file. Search the file?"" hit the yes for manual searching then you will see the ""YouWave_Android"" that is the program we need to patch the select that and hit open button and it will automatically patch it done!! enjoy your fully activated youwave :)"
