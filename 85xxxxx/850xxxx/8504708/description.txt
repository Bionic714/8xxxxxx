Game information
=================

Element4l is an immersive and experimental indie  platform  game,  with  a
strong focus on flow  and  smooth  gameplay,  wrapped  in  an  exceptional
soundtrack by Mind Tree

In Element4l, you control four  elements  who  are  bound  together  on  a
journey to shape life. Your only hindrances are nature  and  the  sun.  It
takes a different, innovative  approach  to  classic  platform  games  and

Element4l is a challenge. The first time you play it, you will struggle
just  like  the  first  time  you've  learned  how   to   ride   a   bike
