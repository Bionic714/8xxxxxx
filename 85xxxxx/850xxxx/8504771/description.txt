This is an unusual date for Jon Faddis. Doubling on flugelhorn, Faddis avoids his upper register and performs ballads while backed by an ensemble arranged by Carlos Franzetti. The backup group consists of five reeds, trombone, a french horn, an occasional oboe or English horn player and a rhythm section. Faddis plays lyrically throughout but there are no exciting or stirring moments to be heard on the ten selections which include "Sophisticated Lady," "Speak Like a Child" "In Your Own Sweet Way" and a medium-tempo "Goodbye." A well-played and professionally arranged program but the overall results are rather forgettable.
