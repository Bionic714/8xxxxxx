,jozsus,2013-05-28T14:06Z,Don't complain things take time ! thanks for seeding!
,lgcosta,2013-05-29T02:53Z,Without a game list and a single file? This is a joke?
,jaw970,2013-05-31T01:05Z,jozsus - who's seeding?  0 seeders means zero seeders
,ClipperCigars,2013-05-31T02:43Z,"To but it bluntly....

Fuck this torrent. 

Even it was being seeded, which it's not. No one in their right mind will blindly download 257 Gigs. 

Probably why it was uploaded anonymously, because they knew what a moronic dip shit they were being when they did. "
