Try VLC player."
,isaac2012,2013-05-30T00:01Z,"Epic quality
Highly recommend downloading this.

A: 9
V: 10

Best quality copy around."
,ers2258,2013-05-31T00:02Z,"This quite actually is a VERY Good copy IMHO.
I'll give it a 9 for Audio and a 9 for Video only because it is not actually a 1080p BDRipped x264 copy. AND this trully IS the Very BEST copy of IM3 that I have seen to date.
Thank You to the Uploader.
Gonna watch it tonight."
