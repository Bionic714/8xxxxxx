Renoise is a music editor that uses old fashioned tracker style (protracker, fasttracker, etc) approach for editing music. It has many built-in features, like instrument editor, mixer, dsp-effects etc. It also supports external MIDI devices, VST instruments/effects and ASIO soundcards. 

Renoise requires DirectX 8 and a SSE capable CPU."

Yea - a lazy freeloader like yourself spend time to logg in and deliver friendly caring comments. 

The uploder is a filesharer. 
You are just an angry psychopath with a childish attitude like the chooka chooka prick. 

Get back to your hit and run business on tpb."
