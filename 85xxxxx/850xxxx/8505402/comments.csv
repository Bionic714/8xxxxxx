Do you trust him now?"
,rudown78,2013-05-25T02:27Z,"Nice try politux. This new upload is all proper flac. These aren't transcodes. Everyone can verify with audiochecker software to after downloading. I'm sure my trust will be regained. Thank you.

,rudown78,2013-05-25T02:29Z,After everyone's done downloading. I want opinions on who has the better torrent. I guarantee you it's mine
,kraftx1,2013-05-29T03:19Z,"Rudown78,
Thanks for taking the time to collect this Joy Division material it is a real gem.  In the argument between you and Politux, why is there a file discrepancy (total # of files in yours is 625 and in his it is 368) am I missing something here?  I didn't look too closely so maybe I am.
Thanks again for your efforts in sharing great music!"
,rudown78,2013-06-01T01:05Z,"kraftx1, 
Thank you for appreciating my torrent. The reason my torrent has more files is because I included the two live albums, the best of collection, the singles box and full artwork for most of the albums. "
,rudown78,2013-06-01T01:09Z,"Oh yeah, one last thing I almost forgot to mention was I included the collector's editions of both Unknown Pleasures and Closer"
