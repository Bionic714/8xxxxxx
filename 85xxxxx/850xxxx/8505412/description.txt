From the back of the album: "This LP was compiled from tapes sent in by KROQ listeners during the summers of 1978 and 79. KROQ, Rhino Records and DEVO would like to thank all the mutants who entered the Devotees contest."

Personal observation: fun album for Devo fans, all of these remakes are from their 1978 album "Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo". Most of the stuff sounds like music you'd hear on the old Dr. Demento radio show. For non-Devo fans this might be a little rough to listen to, though there are some interesting touches of minimalist synth peppered throughout this recording.
