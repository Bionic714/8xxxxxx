In a powerful and intimate memoir, Jackie Hance shares her story of unbearable loss, darkest despair, andΓÇöslowly, painfully, and miraculouslyΓÇöher cautious return to hope and love.

Until the horrific car accident on New York StateΓÇÖs Taconic Parkway that took the lives of her three beloved young daughters, Jackie Hance was an ordinary Long Island mom, fulfilled by the joyful chaos of a household bustling with life and chatter and love. After the tragedy, she was ΓÇ£The Taconic Mom,ΓÇ¥ whose unimaginable loss embodied every parentΓÇÖs worst nightmare. Suddenly, her life-long Catholic faith no longer explained the world. Her marriage to her husband, Warren, was ravaged by wrenching grief and recrimination. And her mind, unable to cope with the unfathomable, reinvented reality each night, so she awoke each morning having forgotten the heartbreaking facts: that Emma, age 8; Alyson, age 7; and Katie, age 5, were gone forever. They were killed in a minivan driven by their aunt, JackieΓÇÖs sister-in-law, Diane Schuler, while returning from a camping weekend on a sunny July morning.
