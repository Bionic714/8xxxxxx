 Glenn Beck, "Control: Exposing the Truth About Guns"
2013 | ISBN-10: 1476739870 | EPUB,

When our founding fathers secured the Constitutional ΓÇ£right of the people to keep and bear arms,ΓÇ¥ they also added the admonition that this right SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED.

It is the only time this phrase appears in the Bill of Rights. So why arenΓÇÖt more people listening?

History has proven that guns are essential to self-defense and libertyΓÇöbut tragedy is a powerful force and has led many to believe that guns are the enemy, that the Second Amendment is outdated, and that more restrictions or outright bans on firearms will somehow solve everything.

They are wrong.

In CONTROL, Glenn Beck presents a passionate, fact-based case for guns that reveals why gun control isnΓÇÖt really about controlling guns at all; itΓÇÖs about controlling us. In doing so, he takes on and debunks the common myths and outright lies that are often used to vilify guns and demean their owners:

The Second Amendment is ABOUT MUSKETS . . . GUN CONTROL WORKS in other countries . . . 40 percent of all guns are sold without BACKGROUND CHECKS . . . More GUNS MEAN more MURDER . . . Mass shootings are becoming more common . . . These awful MASSACRES ARE UNIQUE TO AMERICA . . . No CIVILIAN needs a ΓÇ£weapon of warΓÇ¥ like the AR-15 . . . ARMED GUARDS in schools do nothing, just look at Columbine . . . Stop FEARMONGERING, no one is talking about TAKING YOUR GUNS AWAY.
