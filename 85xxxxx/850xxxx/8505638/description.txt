Hey baby, Little Steven here, and this weekend in the Underground Garage we are celebrating Cinco de Mayo with Santana, the Premiers, Manic Hispanic, Richie Valens, the Electric Prunes, the Ramones, the Hollies, and the Byrds.

We have brand new music from Palmyra Delran, Wylidlife, the Trashed Romeos, John & Brittany, and the amazing follow up to the Andrew Loog Oldham Orchestra, forty years in the making.

Come find out what Orson Welles, Grace Slick, and General Zaragoza have in common.

It's Cinco de Mayo this weekend in the world's only Rock n' Roll dance party on the radio.

I'll see you in the Underground Garage.
