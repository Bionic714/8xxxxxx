,ogstankyfluff,2013-05-27T04:59Z,"audio is out of sync. havent been downloading alot of your stuff bone, but wen i was, they were mostly good. then you upload this with audio sync issues? seriously be professional man. respect the stallone."
,eXindigo,2013-05-29T05:10Z,"Egad! This movie is bad. There is not one whit of humor and it just drags and drags and drags. But it's good to know that an old fart can kick ass on a young well-trained mercenary. Perhaps he and Schwartzenegger should get together and gum through parts in a movie called ""Knock on the Head."" Stallone should stick to comedy as he did in ""Oscar."" A fine effort where this has not much merit.
A - 9
V - 9
M - -10"
,rompelukt,2013-05-29T22:37Z,Sync is NOT Pluss 300... Its Minus 300 ;)

,WordsMyth,2013-06-02T11:15Z,ty Labbe_65 for instead of being a bitch and posting whining about the audio being out of sync for a free movie actually just figuring out the # and posting it for the rest of us and TY .BONE for another great upload fuck the idiots that cant figure out how to sync audio maybe they shouldnt be pirating
,Klee63,2013-06-03T18:02Z,"A=4  (though easy to sync with VLC)
V=8
M=8

I liked this movie from Sly.  He's toned down the violence normally associated with him and allowed others characters to shine through."
