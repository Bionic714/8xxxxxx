Season #1  Episode #3

Lucas's day starts well when he spies a pair of unusual bar stools in the kitchen of the motel where they spent the night. Lucas does a deal with the owner, and packs the stools into the truck. The Pickers head up the Murray River in Victoria to meet Mingo, a collector who specialises in FJ Holdens and vintage Indian and Harley Davidson motorcycles. Mingo's wife is sick of the clutter, so he's planning to have a large clearing sale on the site, but he gives the Pickers a preview of his stock. Lucas picks up a 1970 Indian Trail Bike, but is it a real Indian? Or has he done his dough?

Back on the road, they meet John, a former antique dealer. John has closed his store and all his stock is spread among two houses side by side in suburban Wagga. As a dealer, John is a skilled negotiator and a hard bargainer, as Adam finds out several times during their visit. Lucas buys a tray of cutlery for $10, but he's fairly sure there are some valuable pieces in there and he?s going to get a silver expert to value them.

Then it's off to a massive storage shed owned by Brian Toole. Brian's family ran an army disposal business for many years, until Brian closed the store and put all the stock in the shed. He stocks huge amounts of military material, along with a number of collectables.

Back at Picker HQ, the Silver expert appraises the cutlery Lucas bought from John the antique dealer. What will it be worth?
