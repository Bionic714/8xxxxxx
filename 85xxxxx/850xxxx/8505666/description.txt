"The series follows an elite mercenary unit, The Black Company, last of the Free Companies of Khatovar, through roughly forty years of its approximately four hundred year history. Cook mixes fantasy with military fiction in gritty, down-to-earth portrayals of the CompanyΓÇÿs chief personalities and its struggles.

"The main chronology spans nine novels, which can be grouped into three sections: The Books of the North recount the CompanyΓÇÖs dealings with the Empire of Lady; the Books of the South follow the Company on its journey back to its beginnings in Khatovar; Glittering Stone sees the Company achieve victory over its employer's enemies, and move on to its destiny.

"Additionally, there is one spin-off novel, The Silver Spike, which follows events concerning former members of the Company and one of its adversaries."
