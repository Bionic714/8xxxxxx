LOVE to watch these because you basically are getting all the good stuff without the junk in between. THanks loads for all your work. (I'm assuming that you do all the eidting, etc.)  Also, I'm probably just being impatient, but is the Red Wing/Chicago game from the 23rd gonna show up?  I was trying to not see who won until I saw it show up here, but darn... found out while checking the time for tomorrows game on NBC.

Thanks Again, and sorry for rambling.  :-)"
