Title says it all - freshly ported by yours truly (me lol). Was a bit of a pain in the ass to port it but the game runs perfectly. The only disturbing thing is that you cannot skip through the intro / dialogs like you could in the classic version .... oh well, therefore we have Full HD graphics at 1920 by 1080 ;) Proudly ported on a Hackintosh :)
