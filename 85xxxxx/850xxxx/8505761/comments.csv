I had no idea it existed..

Its truly strange to see something so familiar become so different..I mean this is basically a different movie..its not a '40 seconds added so now its an extended version'..this has maybe 25 minutes? More? Entire premise and plot scenes that are not in the original..very weird but interesting experience..graci!"
