At long last, my almost-nine-month-long labor of love is finally finished. What I originally intended to be a small, silly birthday present for Catie back in Spring eventually grew and changed into something truly colossal. Today, on the two-year anniversary of CatieΓÇÖs return to the internet, IΓÇÖd like to present my tribute to one of the most amazing girls ever, and the awesome community thatΓÇÖs built up around her.

The first ever full-length, fully playable Boxxysphere RPG:

BOXXYQUEST: THE SHIFTED SPIRES

What is BoxxyQuest? It's an epic fantasy saga set in the magical land of the Internet.
A terrible, web-changing cataclysm has reformatted the virtual world and left this new Internet on the verge of total deletion.
Now, Catie and her companions must venture out into the Sphere and work together to stop an omnicidal maniac from erasing everything they've ever known.
Along the way, they'll encounter untold dangers, wonderous places, mysterious allies, shocking secrets, and so much more...

While playing BoxxyQuest, you can expect to find the following! :D

&gt; A massively epic plot-driven adventure!

&gt; Seven towns and Eight dungeons based on locations in the community!

&gt; Everyone in the Sphere is in the game somewhere!

&gt; Challenging bosses!

&gt; Nine playable characters in the party! *

&gt; 30-35 Hours of playtime! **

&gt; Sidequests, bonus cutscenes, easter eggs, and loads of optional content!


* Two of these are optional, via sidequests.
** Maybe. See the corresponding question in the F.A.Q. for details.
