The movie begins with Jay (Prabhas) practicing guitar when a girl runs to him and asks him to save her from a gang of goons chasing her. Then Jay, without fighting, resolves the conflict. The girl introduces herself as Manasa (Richa Gangopadhyay). They slowly become friends. But one day she asks Jay to leave her and go as she cannot stand the separation from him if their relationship develops any further. He then goes back to India and with his friend's help reaches Manasa's village. There, where everyone are conservative in nature, he changes their nature and makes them more lovable.
When Manasa expresses her love for him , he tells his flashback. It is then revealed that he was born to their rival's family. His father wanted to convert the people of his village. But his mother didn't want to stay there , so she left him. Later when Jay goes there, he falls in love with Vennela (Anushka Shetty).
He starts taking revenge on the other family without revealing his identity. Then they decide to marry Jay with Vennela because they both are in love with each other. During the marriage the inspector tells his father that the enmity is rekindling because his son is taking revenge on the rivals. Soon afterwards, the rivals come and start killing everyone. After the fight it is known that Jay's mother dies. His father banishes him and blames her death on him. The story is now back to the present. Manasa's father challenges Jay that if he can defeat his men then he too would follow non violence. After successfully defeating them, her father asks Jay that if he could defeat the rival's son ( not knowing that it was Jay himself) he would marry Manasa to Jay.
Jay gets angry at his stubbornness and reveals his true identity. He starts beating him up. Then all her family members come and convert him too. This was watched by his father who had just arrived there. His father welcomes him back to the family. The film ends with him reuniting with Vennela.
