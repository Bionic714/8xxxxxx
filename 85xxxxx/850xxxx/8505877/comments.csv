,crazyoliv,2013-05-24T22:07Z,"I am in the french's alps. There is persistent snow @ 1300m, 20cm powder @ 1700m, and summer below... what a strange configuration this year.
I was with my ScottGeniusLT2011 DownHill'ing 1000mD- by this perfect snow and next by the mud through the forest... a must. 
This bloody italians cut out today's race to give an advantage tyo Nibali (The guy doesn't need it to win... if you know what I mean...).
What a waste. 
THanks BazilBrush anyway"
,BasilBrush,2013-05-24T22:48Z,I'm sure they could have organised a street race around Milan or Turin. That would be entertaining for the spectators.
,BasilBrush,2013-05-25T14:07Z,Stage 20 will be uploaded about 3am Sunday morning (26-May-2013).
