Soon we have only 1 of 3 Fame-girls left. The site was built around these 3

famous sweet teen darlings. We have followed them for about 10 years now.

And no, they can't be replaced by some new chick(s) with no history behind

them. Fame-Girls should end with Ella and if they want to continue build a new

site with a different name. If i ever want new girls then i choose Met-Art or

New Stars etc...
