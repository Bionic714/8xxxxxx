What does SpeedUpMyPC Plus RegistryBooster do?
The problem: Is your PC getting slower? With so many different settings, files and processes to monitor, it is hard to identify just what is slowing you down, let alone implement the necessary technical adjustments to recover speed and performance. 

The solution: SpeedUpMyPC 2013 scans your computer to identify slowdown issues hindering speed, before wielding a powerful range of tools to optimize your system for improved performance. Slowdown issues, such as invalid registry entries are removed and unused processes deactivated to free up space. The result is a computer that works faster and better.
