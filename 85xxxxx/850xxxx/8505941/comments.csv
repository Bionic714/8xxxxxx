man many thanks for Tron Legacy (2010)

A: 10/10
V: 10/10

Why is the tron movie some scenes are in widescreen and some scenes are in fullscreen mode?

Perfect in great video and audio. Are your movies are cinavia free or protected. Because today many of blu-ray's disks and players are cinavia protected."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-25T09:42Z,"only movies that are cinavia protected are the ones with the cinavia protection built into it, at which point any movie played back on a cinavia protected player such as sony tvs and almost every blu ray player out there that conformed to the bluray standard for the last 2 years will not be able to play it.

Example being Men in Black 3, there is currently no version of this movie that doesn't have cinavia imbedded in the audio of the dvd... blurays...ps3... and I've been told even the iTunes download.

You will only run into cinavia protection errors on with a cinavia movie and a cinavia player. All else should play it without issue.

Tron legacy is a partial anamorphic as well as imax filmed movie, just like Dark Knight Rises, it jumps between anamorphic (widescreen) and imax (full screen) throughout the movie."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-05-25T17:09Z,"this is only the theatrical, not the extended edition as stated in the description."
,heathen29,2013-05-26T03:23Z,Thanks...please accept my apologies for asking the question...I re-read your reply and realized (obviously) that I didn't catch the part where you talk about the extended version. 
,heathen29,2013-05-26T03:23Z,"Funny thing is that I usually pride myself on doing just that, and here I go and blunder myself...UGH...Thanks again. I appreciate it."
