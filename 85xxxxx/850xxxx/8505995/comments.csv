Do you have the semis too, please?"
,edkabayo,2013-05-25T03:10Z,Languages?
,VladBin,2013-05-25T09:10Z,"@ edkabayo

This is the rip of the FEED recording, the only languages are those used by the host, Petra Mede... there are no any off-screen comments and any on-screen logos of national broadcasters ...  only the show in its pure form. "

My dear friend, the event was broadcast in 26 countries and each country as conveyed in their original language, so depending on who recorded it so will the program language. Please do not answer my question if not completely downloaded, and  keep your logical responses,so once again:
Languages​​?"

I tell you a small secret, this upload is mine, so believe me, I know what I'm talking about. And you, as I see, know nothing about what the FEED transmission does mean and what is transmitted in such a way. One advice for you, just downlod and see it yourself. No offence, frd !"
,BloodyALB,2013-05-25T22:28Z,"Please can you upload the original source? (As you have written: 
Video: MPEG2 4:2:2 / 1080/50i / 35 Mbps 
Audio: Dolby E 5.1 / 24-bit / 2304 Kbps )
Thank You Very Much!"

It would have been easier to say the language than all your crap technique, however I already downloaded it from another source and in  the desired language. Thanks for your time I see you have too much  and enjoy making others lose their as download 10 GBs to your pc without knowing what are you  getting to the end.Get yourself a life"

Have you ever bought the official DVD of the Eurovision Song Contest? If yes, then you might know that the DVD version does not contain any commentary or TV station logos. No telephone numbers are shown on the screen either. This upload is just like that, only in super-awesome 720p HD with 50fps from a 1080i source. Captured by satellite, I guess."
,andreyyshore,2013-05-29T15:50Z,"Amazing quality. Can you upload the semis too, please?"
,VladBin,2013-05-30T08:50Z,"@ andreyyshore

You can find semis on ex.ua, here is the link:
http://www.ex.ua/view/53588062

p.s.
It's an Ukrainian source, I mean ex.ua, so I'm not sure whether there is a possibility to access it from outside of Ukraine. If not, you can also find semis with the same quality on Usenet."

Thanks. Actually, I had already found those sources; I was just thinking that the files would be more easily accessible here. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a Usenet newsgroup that's both free and decent (I only just found out what Usenet is), so I accessed ex.ua via Google Translate. I'm currently at around 70% on each semi, but the downloading speed is not very satisfactory (probably because I have to use a proxy for it to work). The direct download is much faster (because I *don't* have to use a proxy), but stops after about 1 GB, like most other HTTP downloads. Anyway, at least I'm happy that these files can be found *somewhere*, so thanks for that."
