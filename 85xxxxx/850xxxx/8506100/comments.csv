TO THE 1767 LEECHERS...........FUCK YOU....."
,DogTop,2013-05-25T00:05Z,"You do understand, of course, that EVERYONE (including YOU) is a ""leecher"" until their file is completed?  Of course you understand this, otherwise you'd just be some random asshole spouting nonsense verbal diarrhea."
,zakimar5,2013-05-25T02:39Z,"I think the title of this movie refers to what the audience would have preferred happen to them rather than having seen this movie.

No wonder this movie lost so much money.

And what kind of ahole complains about people leeching from TPB?"
,cryotoxic86,2013-05-25T06:31Z,"simplyfaster= moron, when u downloaded this u were leeching it! so basically u just told yourself 2 fuckoff..... lmfao"

,Ssgtmcnasty,2013-05-25T18:08Z,"@simplyfaster, thanks for saving everyone the trouble of telling you ""Fuck you"" by saying it to yourself... ignorant moron...

@Chased911, thanks for the first useful comment

@Sam, thanks for upload."
,TheBlueGoose,2013-05-25T22:05Z,"@simplyfaster, You need a Bullet to your asshole :D
Thanks SaM"
,eXindigo,2013-05-26T03:16Z,"There was a six episode TV series with some A-list actors that was hilarious. It was called ""Bullet in the Face"" and was so over the top that it was fantastic. It starred Eric Roberts and Eddie Izzart among others. This may be the same and I will give it a try just for that. The Schwarzenegger romp ""Last Stand was a borefest. Maybe Stalone can do better."
,zakimar5,2013-05-26T03:39Z,"It's a BRrip from SaM - of course it's first rate, but if it wasn't, I would have stated so in my previous comment.

Stallone was completely over the top, as usual, but to compensate, they made the detective a real pussy AND and ahole. But at least the woman who played his daughter, Sarah Shahi is HOTTT. The best (and only decent) acting in this ""film"" came from Christian Slater."
,samtronman,2013-05-26T08:58Z,bullet to the STallones career

,bballjoey2012,2013-05-26T17:58Z,@chased911 and @headhundar why do you idiots call this flawless and perfect yet give the a/v only 9/10? i would love to watch what yall give a 10/10
,Chased911,2013-05-26T23:34Z,"@ bballjoey2012 : first and foremost, the only idiot here is you. second, flawless is relative, 10/10 is impossible, even if it's a perfect blue-ray rip - you will lose some quality. third, again, you're the idiot."
,DrMD,2013-05-26T23:40Z,"The V=8 A=7 kind of sounds under water at times but overall the movie is pretty much crap, DL only if you ain't got shit else on sat, cable or netflix."
,TQTQTQ,2013-05-27T17:47Z,"Thank you.
:-)"
,srkaren,2013-05-28T01:33Z,dear ETRG + SaM  thank you for the smallersize and great quality.  I so appreciate your generous giving of your time and talents.  God bless you.
[V],Slickinator,2013-05-29T00:14Z,yep cause for a torrent to work u need leachers and seeds together it makes a whole movie .... a circle of life and wheres pumba singing akunata lol
,eXindigo,2013-05-29T21:41Z,"Egad! This movie is bad. There is not one whit of humor and it just drags and drags and drags. But it's good to know that an old fart can kick ass on a young well-trained mercenary. Perhaps he and Schwartzenegger should get together and gum through parts in a movie called ""Knock on the Head."" Stallone should stick to comedy as he did in ""Oscar."" A fine effort where this has not much merit.
