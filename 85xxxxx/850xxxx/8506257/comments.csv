,HakeemGR,2013-06-06T14:50Z,does online play working ?
,FlutterScratch,2013-06-07T04:10Z,bruss your torrents have viruses. every time I download yours it says there is a virus. if I download someone elses for the same game it doesn't say there is one.

,FlutterScratch,2013-06-09T04:02Z,did you not read the rest of my comment. I have downloaded the exact same games from different people and mcafee was just like yep this is okay. but anything this guy puts up sets it off. plus I got counter strike source from this guy and that fucked my computer till I deleted it.
,FlutterScratch,2013-06-09T04:10Z,"also an earlier version of this uploaded by bruss has .1 gig more than this one, how does that work. and this one goes at like 4 kb a second. the earlier version goes at 500 kb. why not just get the old one and use the auto updater?"

Immediately delete all of my build. And do not download them anymore. Download builds of other authors. Good luck."
,B.T.R.G.,2013-06-09T19:45Z,"Mcafee it's a virus itself, so just change ur antivirus, lol! Seriously try Kaspersky or Eset! Personally i'm using bruss.aka.durka9 since last November and never had that kind of problem!!!!"
,FlutterScratch,2013-06-11T13:36Z,mcafee is a anti virus that comes with windows. it is trusted by Microsoft. I highly doubt its a virus.
,FlutterScratch,2013-06-11T13:40Z,"oh by the way bruss I don't mean to insult you in anyway. im just a little apprehensive of your torrents especially since my antivirus has worn off, and I don't have the money to renew it, and I have had bad history with your torrents. but im sure your a good guy and all. just trying to let (the good piratebay users) try games before they buy them."
,B.T.R.G.,2013-06-11T20:56Z,"Mcafee is one of the worst anti virus around and that's i was trying to say mate..i was just sarcastic (no offence, that's my style) ;) 
Bruss L4D2 torrents r working always perfect for me on the other hand (no problems, no viruses/don't know if i am a ""good"" PB user though :P)..."
