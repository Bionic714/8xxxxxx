ROGER KELLAWAY    (b. 1939)


A JAZZ PORTRAIT     (1963) Regina/Fresh Sound        digitized 1990


Roger's first album as leader  (3) tracks feature Jim Hall and Steve Swallow (b)




Wikipedia failed to mention Roger's collaboration with Zoot Sims which in my

book gives any musician instant cred.......fA
