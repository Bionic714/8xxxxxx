Ashampoo┬« Snap 6

Ashampoo Snap 6 provides everything you need to capture
information, apply annotations and effects to illustrate your
point and publish the results.

CAPTURE:

Ashampoo Snap 6 provides multiple capture modes to cover all
possible eventualities. Besides optional keyboard shortcuts to
trigger the different modes, there is no fiddling with your
keyboard required as most modes simply involve mouse positioning
and clicking to begin/end the capturing process.

Fixed Size Region
┬╖ Select any application window, including scrolling windows,
and have Ashampoo Snap 6 capture their entire contents to
image files. You may also capture your entire desktop or
application menus.
┬╖ Additionally, Ashampoo Snap 6 provides presets for common
window sizes. 

Free Size Region
┬╖ Either use a freely resizable rectangle shape or draw your own
shape to capture any region of your screen. 

Timer
┬╖ Some scenarios require interval capturing, e.g. to record a
step-by-step process for a tutorial project. In this mode,
Ashampoo Snap 6 either creates a single screenshot after a
definable time period (10 to 30 seconds) or several at a
customizable interval from ΓÇ£Every 5th SecondΓÇ¥ to ΓÇ£Every HourΓÇ¥.
┬╖ This mode works with the desktop, application windows or a
freely resizable rectangle area. 

Video
┬╖ Although Ashampoo Snap 6 already provides timer-based
capturing at fixed intervals, some cases require higher
framerates only possible through video capturing. In Ashampoo
Snap 6, video and audio codec settings are customizable
including framerate, format and bitrate. Sound recording is
supported through any available Windows recording device.
┬╖ Additionally, Ashampoo Snap 6 provides settings to allow for
mouse cursor effects such as glowing on mouse clicks as well
as video post processing including effects such as Sepia and
automatic resizing.
┬╖ Recording is either done on the fly for faster machines or
with disk caching for slower machines.
┬╖ This mode works with the desktop, application windows, freely
resizable and fixed-size rectangle areas as well as any
available webcam.
