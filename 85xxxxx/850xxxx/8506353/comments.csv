A lot better then the rest so far
A6 not bad 
V 7(for a cam) camera stays still in this 1, small autofocus issue but all in all very watchable for cam watchers "
,gozinya,2013-05-25T00:40Z,"Overall this is MUCH better than previous versions. No flickering, film is complete. Has some minor sync issues and dark scenes are a bit too dark, but a good rip nonetheless. Thanks!"
,cinjade,2013-05-25T01:48Z,"Thank you...a lot of work went into this.

Nice!"
,tflagger997,2013-05-25T17:26Z,"A:4 (poor), V:5 (over-saturated)
Same most of the previous cams, but without the flicker.  

xxxlavalxxx is including a sample file, unlike many others.  If a cam does not have a sample, do not download it (unless you have unlimited Bandwidth and great speed).

So DL this one for yourself and see if the quality will let you enjoy this movie, or if you need to wait.  Just make sure to put the movie on ""do not download"" while you are checking the sample."
,cjolwd,2013-05-25T17:33Z,Hard-coded subtitles for Klingon are in German.
,cjolwd,2013-05-25T18:00Z,"Halfway through the movie, and considering the right lower corner of the screen is blurry, i've translated most of the subs using Google Translator.

V:7
Some spit in the right bottom corner:6

Overall: not too bad for CAM."
,sammyboblammy,2013-05-26T04:40Z,thanksssss amigo
,iampatrickhi,2013-05-26T09:12Z,Thank you for your hard work almost forgot I was watching a cam. Thanks for sharing!
,FreeGameFreak77,2013-05-26T11:17Z,I passed up a few other Cam UL..but this one getting some good A/V's and Comments. 
,ScottyD7421,2013-05-26T15:15Z,"Thanks for the upload, much appreciated.

V/7
A/6

First off the video is steady right through, no movements whatsoever. For the most part the picture is clear. There are a few minor blur moments but only for 2 seconds give or take, dark scenes aren't too bad, overall i had no problems with watching and seeing everything that was going on.

Audio was good with a few minor sync issues which don't last very long. I clearly heard everything that was being said so no problems there.

All in all this is a very good copy for a cam and i highly recommend downloading if you are keen to watch the movie.

Cheers"

,OrderJesse,2013-05-27T01:39Z,"One of the best Cams I have seen in years. Sync drops out a couple times for 30ses, though overall very watchable for a Cam and I would recommend  

7/V 7/A (for cam) 7.2/M "
,LOKI_LOKI,2013-05-27T08:32Z,"A = 4
V = 7

Thanks, but no thanks.  While this is a cam copy I've seen better and recently including the recently released Iron Man 3 movie.

The video, while watchable, seems a tad out of focus and the color is off somewhat.  For a cam copy the video isn't bad.

The audio is amplified to the point that it's difficult to understand.  My native language is English by the way.

If someone is able to clean up the audio with this video I'd definitely finish watching it.  I can't enjoy a show when I have to struggle to understand what they actors are saying."
,charley0,2013-05-27T20:24Z,"Very satisfactory and watchable cam, thanks *S"
,Osiris69,2013-05-28T04:25Z,"Save yourselves all the trouble I went through trying to find a good copy.  Download this copy if you want a full, complete, V:8/A:5 Cam copy that is the best I've found so far.  This is almost as good as a DVD screener if it wasn't for the Cam video and mono audio.

Just my humble opinion."
,Evan_85,2013-05-28T10:20Z,"Cool, a watchable version...

Now all I need is a subtitle that not just looks English, but actually 100% English. Anyone got one?

BTW, the current ones match if you offset them to -202 seconds."
