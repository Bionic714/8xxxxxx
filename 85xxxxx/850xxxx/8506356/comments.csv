,maddog7777,2013-05-25T04:54Z,"How in the hell did you get a Blue Ray rip down to less than 400MB? I am dying to know, really! Judging by the screens it looks like crap, no offense so I was assuming either half the movie is missing or you compressed to the lowest quality available. Just asking. "
,ChivveZ,2013-05-25T05:25Z,It is the full movie nothing missing.
