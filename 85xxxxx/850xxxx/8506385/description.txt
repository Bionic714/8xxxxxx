Overview
For the 1970's late-night horror show, The Price of Fear, the BBC dramatized the most chilling stories they could find, drawing on talented new writers as well as the established master of terror who narrated tale, re-written as though Price actually experienced each chilling adventure himself.  The show was enormously successful in the UK and abroad, and three series were made - 1973, 1975 and 1982.
