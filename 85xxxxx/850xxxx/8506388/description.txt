  Hello all. I spent a very long time trying to find this. On TPB all I could get was up to 1.13b and I was getting the odd Cambria crash to desktop. This is 1.13e and I am pretty sure it is all of the DLC. Comes with a very easy to use unpacker by R.G. Shift. 
  Install is very simple just locate the folder and run the setup from there. As a warning it does want you to disable your antivirus. I scanned afterwards and everything is 100%
