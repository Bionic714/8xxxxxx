,hollisb,2013-05-25T01:43Z,"Finally, a PC release!"
,Jailing,2013-05-25T03:58Z,"I was never really a gamer for the side scrolling franchises out there but seeing this game on reviews caught my eye and looks beautiful.

Thanks"
,MadRevolver,2013-05-25T06:16Z,Thank you dude! I will find you a hot woman (Kate Upton look alike) so you can keep uploading your cool ninja stuff when she does her home duties.
,D3adk3nny,2013-05-25T07:02Z,How does one mount when there is no iso file.
,Jailing,2013-05-25T07:25Z,"@D3adk3nny

You must be new to this...
1: Download the Torrent.
2: Go to the folder and open it, right click the file ""flt-daet"" and choose ""Open with... (WinRAR or what ever ZIP program you use)""

3: Extract the the ISO and Mount. "

,Zedlav,2013-05-26T02:25Z,"Help! I downloaded it and joined the parts using Hjsplit... but the file has no format (so I added the .iso to it) and when I open it it says the disc file is corrupted.. (I'm using Windows 8, no daemon tools)"
,saffronsghost,2013-05-26T10:51Z,"For me it freezes during install at ""NET framework  4.0 cmd"" (brings up a DOS prompt that never does anything).  I closed that, then install finished.

 But the crack doesn't do anything either, just another program that sits there doing nothing..."
,Kitchupoy,2013-05-26T16:45Z,"I started playing the game and everything went great so far but there's this bug and I can't open any chest at all even if have a key with me. I don't know how to fix this, I tried reinstalling and it's still there.. Can any1 help me out?"
,ColdanCursed,2013-05-26T18:27Z,"Just wanted to say, thanks. Works fine. 

For those who don't know how to use it, right click the 001 file and open with Winrar. Then mount the ISO using daemon tools and profit. 

Make sure to buy the game if you have fun with it, I know I'm going to. Support the creators! "
,Capnmaf,2013-05-26T20:11Z,"@ColdanCrusader - Or ""creator"". Hard to believe this game was made by one guy. It's really well done."
,Capnmaf,2013-05-26T20:12Z,"ColdanCursed* Sorry for the misspell, was looking at multiple things. :)"
,HeinTobi,2013-05-27T00:10Z,"Hi everybody
I have a big Problem.
The game (I""m at 49% ) just shut down my PC every time! I have no idea why! Other games like 
The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing  or Bioshock Infinite runs perfekt without any problems ...I hope somebody can help me!"
,synesthesik,2013-05-27T01:16Z,"@saffronsghost

I have the same problem.  Extracted, mounted, and installed.  Everything goes smooth until .NET redist tries to run and then a .cmd prompt comes up and does nothing.  Close that and then apply crack, but nothing happens.  Tried running as admin as well, nothing.  Also tried to repair and reinstall .NET 4.0 but no success there either.

I hope someone can address this because I'd really like to play!

Thanks in advance."
,Melow35,2013-05-27T01:31Z,"It works great, the chest problem is not just for this, the original one also has this problem, probably going to have a update with a fix for this. 

Also, is it just me, or is there no voice acting at all in the intro scene? After that the voices work fine, but the old man's voice at the intro is non existant for me."
,godsbreast,2013-05-27T09:24Z,"@saffronsghost and synesthesik

i just googled Net Framework and downloaded the most recent one 4.5 from the microsoft site, once that was installed the game seemed to install fine and not freeze on the NET framework 4.0 cmd prompt. :D"
,synesthesik,2013-05-27T17:03Z,"@godsbreast

Thanks so much dude.  Worked perfectly.  I'm surprised I didn't think to do an official DL of the new framework.  Live and learn.  "
,pairet89,2013-05-28T01:23Z,"Great game! It works perfect too. Those having problems update your grafic's card drivers, direct x, net framework"
,z01z,2013-05-28T04:03Z,"works for me, just one small thing, it keeps my processor at 100% usage at all times.  checked on steam forums, seems like a common issue and the dev is looking into it.  so there maybe an update coming out soon that will hopefully fix that and a few other things like people crashing and unable to open random chests."
,z01z,2013-05-28T18:15Z,any word on if we can get the newest update (1.02) uploaded soon? thanks.
,Maou-JP,2013-05-30T02:20Z,Patch 1.03 is up! 
,Epigene,2013-05-30T17:18Z,"Where is this patch, sir? Cuz my game crashes and burns around the time I reach level 2 :/"

,WD-i,2013-06-08T19:25Z,"Is it supposed to be a folder of 29 different files? 
They're all flt-daet.001 through flt-daet.029 file-types, one is the NFO, and the other is a flt-daet.sfv

I can open all the numbered files in 7-zip, but they all seem to contain the same ISO. 

Can anyone explain?"
