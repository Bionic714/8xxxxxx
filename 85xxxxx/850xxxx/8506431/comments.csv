Lemme guess: it's a whole bunch of Klansmen, getting blowjobs from polar bears, in front of a bunch of igloos at the base of an iceberg, in the middle of a raging blizzard at high noon, with the big igloo right behind them having a fresh coat of white paint.

...And, if you look *really* close, their pockets are being picked by Obama and an IRS Hit Squad, all dressed as Good Humor Ice Cream Men, and wearing heavy Whiteface. The only problem is that since 99.9999% of all Klansmen are poor White trash, all Obama and his men are finding are white napkins crusted with spooge instead of greenbacks.

Truthfully, if anything should be repealed, it's your internet access, you racist cracker IDIOT!"
