"Although not up to the passionate level of the Mingus-Dolphy quintet, this 

underrated unit holds it's own."    ..............Scott Yanow     ALLMUSIC




Thanks a heap Scott!   Now we know that we're not wasting our time listening to

Charles Mingus on his own label.



(2) tracks....1 per vinyl record side.....telling us that this release was not

aimed at instant commercial success.    It holds it's own............fA
