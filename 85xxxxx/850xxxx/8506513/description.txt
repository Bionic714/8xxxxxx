House of Heroes is an alternative rock band from Columbus, Ohio. The band got started in 1996 at Hilliard Davidson High School (Hilliard, OH), originally as a punk band called Plan B, with Tim Skipper, A.J. Babcock, and Nate Rothacker on drums. In 1998, Colin Rigsby replaced Nate Rothacker on drums and they changed their name to No Tagbacks, then later to House of Heroes.
