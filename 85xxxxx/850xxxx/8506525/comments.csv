,XtraZoom,2013-05-25T04:21Z,Question! This is update 1.0.0.1 or newer 1.0.0.2?
,XtraZoom,2013-05-25T04:37Z,nevermind I can answered it myself its 1.0.0.1 game developer is crazy to have 3 updates for a game in just few days.
,ArkAngel666,2013-05-26T03:15Z,"@XtraZoom you'll more than likely find it's because of bugs and small glitches and the like that were found after mass production had commenced and they were testing retail releases. 

It's an obvious decision to create a single or numerous update to distribute after launch as halting then discarding a production of hundreds of thousands of copies of games will only be destroyed and thus send development costs sky high."
