,abvault,2013-05-25T17:57Z,If you see a book you want simply click the download links contained within the post. If you need further assistance please leave a message on the site and someone will be able to assist.
,MagiciansFR,2013-05-26T00:48Z,"Wellllll! Using Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera, the Upload Download buttons were covered be ads and unavailable. Using Safari I finally got to see the Download Upload buttons below the description of each book. Clicking on a download button I don't get the book, I get invited to download and install inVid, not sure what that is other than yet another way to throw up a pethera of ads on my computer which clicking on just about anything else on that site does. Don't see any place on the site to actually ask any questions. Can audiobooks actually be downloaded from the site, for free? If so, what's the secret??"
,Kalusa,2013-05-27T03:56Z,Google and find Utorrent.  DL and install.  Click on Get This Torrent.  Download file.  Listen.
,MagiciansFR,2013-05-27T21:08Z,"Kalusa, are you talking about Audiobookvault? Because there is no Get This Torrent there and any download button you can find to click on there takes you to an add. Does anyone know how to download a file on audiobookvault.ws? Sure could use some help."
,abvault,2013-05-30T22:57Z,On the homepage of the site find a post and click 'Uploaded' and follow the prompts. As mentioned before - if you have problems please leave them on the site and someone will help you. Thanks.
