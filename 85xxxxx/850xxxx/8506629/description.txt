Playing tips.

* Start off in the Rookie 1000, but as soon as you get to grips with the controls, switch up to the Red Squirrel for greater speed and agility!

* Each difficulty has different levels. Once you master the Easy difficulty, move on to Normal.

* Fast Stars are hard to earn in Normal and very hard in Expert. Try getting the Perfect Stars first, you can go as slowly as you want - just don't hit anything. With all the Perfect Stars from Easy and Normal you'll unlock a faster chopper that will help you beat them, (although they are all beatable in the Red Squirrel).

* Try to find the 'racing line' in a level. Turn before you get to the gems so you're already aiming for the next one as you collect the first.

* Try using the Rookie 1000 to earn Perfect Stars in later levels. You won't beat the Target Times, but Perfect Stars are about clearing the level without bumping into things!
