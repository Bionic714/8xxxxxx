 : Label 228 is a gathering of street art executed on priority mail labels    :
 : (Label 228, in official parlance) and displayed in public spaces. It's a   :
 : remarkably prevalent method of exposure featured by graffiti artists       :
 : worldwide. These labels are free, portable, and quick and easy to exhibit, :
 : offering artists the chance to spend more time creating their work than if :
 : they were to paint and write directly on walls, vehicles, and public       :
 : objects.                                                                   :
 : camden noir launched his Label 228 project by putting out a call to        :
 : artists, asking them to send him their artwork or anything, for that       :
 : matter, on priority mail labels. Within six months, he received over 500   :
 : labels from artists all over the world. At this point, he has over 1,500   :
 : labels from over 600 artists. This is a collection of the best of those    :
 : labels, in a beautiful, full-color book.                                   :
