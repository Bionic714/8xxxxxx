 : This comprehensive text/reference presents a broad review of               :
 : state-of-the-art 3D video production technologies and applications. The    :
 : book opens with a concise introduction to the field, before examining the  :
 : geometric, photometric, and dynamical design and calibration methods for   :
 : multi-view camera systems, including practical implementation technologies.:
 : A range of algorithms are then described for producing 3D video from the   :
 : video data captured by these systems. A selection of 3D video applications :
 : are also demonstrated.                                                     :
