I do not mean to be ungrateful, but i would really like to see good quality rip, not cut with big black parts on top and on bottom..."

This movie was not shot in the current tv industry standard of 16x9 but was shot in an ultra wide movie standard of 2.35x1, hence the resolution coming out to 1856x800. You will get those black bars on any 16x9 tv or monitor."
