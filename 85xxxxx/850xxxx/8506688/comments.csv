,CommonsCarnival,2013-05-25T06:59Z,This game is amazing! Highly recommend it!
,saffronsghost,2013-05-26T10:52Z,"For me it freezes during install at ""NET framework  4.0 cmd"" (brings up a DOS prompt that never does anything).  I closed that, then install finished.

 But the crack doesn't do anything either, just another program that sits there doing nothing..."

Already joined it using HJSplit then got a big file with no extension file. What next?"
,Zebra667,2013-05-27T17:50Z,"JayemWTF, WTF are you talking about? It's an ISO, you mount it with PowerISO or DaemonTools...what's this splitting and joining crap you speak of?"
