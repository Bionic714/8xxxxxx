Files are really updating the game properly!
Aim fix is there!
BE AWARE that there is new ini file 3DMGame.ini which contains PlayerName = ""3DMGAME"" and will make ur save games non valid!"
,mansonfamily,2013-05-25T15:31Z,"  For saves to work :
- change in 3DMGame.ini PlayerName with yours
- play the game until first save
- copy and overwrite data0 from ""AppDataLocalFLTSteam222480remote"" to ""AppDataLocalSKIDROW222480Storage"""
