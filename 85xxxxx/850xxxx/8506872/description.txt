Gangs of Oz - Season 2 "COMPLETE"

Gangs of Oz is back with another unprecedented tour of the seedy underworld of organised crime in Australia. Intricately organised criminal networks, family connections, groups brought together by violence and drugs, they come in all shapes, sizes and guises. For bikies, Middle Eastern drug barons, the ever present mafia and street gangs controlling their territory with guns and knuckle dusters, theirs is a war waged daily in every Australian city. Gangs of Oz Season 2 again pulls back the curtain on Australian gangs, going behind the guns, tattoos, suits and leather jackets to meet the people who know the true stories from first hand experience; people who are, or have been, on the frontline of Australian gang warfare Gangs of Oz tells the real-life tales of deception, terror and extraordinary brutality, betrayed friendships, the rise and fall of astonishing fortunes and the lives needlessly lost in our communities. These are the stories behind the stories which make the headlines.
