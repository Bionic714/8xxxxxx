From Wikipedia:



Gary Malcolm Wright (born April 26, 1943) is an American musician, best known for his songs "Dream Weaver" and "Love Is Alive" as well as his work with the British band Spooky Tooth.

Wright was born and raised in Cresskill, New Jersey. He attended Tenafly High School in Tenafly, New Jersey.

A former child actor, Wright appeared in the 1954 original Broadway production of the long-running musical, Fanny (888 performances), having originated the role of Acolyte and then subsequently replacing Lloyd Reese in the role of Cesario, the son of Fanny. The title role of Fanny was originated by Florence Henderson who later gained worldwide fame as matriarch Carol Brady in the long-running TV series, The Brady Bunch. According to Henderson, Reese had to be replaced by Wright because (in her own words): "He (Reese) was a New York boy and puberty struck very early. It wasn't long till he looked like my boyfriend!"
