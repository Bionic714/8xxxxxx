Ken Tucker wrote the following on the Entertainment Weekly website:

Craig Ferguson had no studio audience this night, and only one guest. 
Actor-writer-comedian-polymath and occasional Bones cast member Stephen Fry. 
They just talked. 
It was one of the best hours of TV IΓÇÖve seen in a while.
