,BabiesDontNeedSpleens,2013-05-25T08:10Z,"Thanks, man. Feels silly to say, but I missed your post on the Image UL about you slowing your roll. Have a tenancy not to read when I know the name and the taste, lol. anyhow, thanks for all the ULs and recommendations. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-25T14:53Z,"no way, that isn't silly at all. it's impossible to read all the descriptions and comments.

i would like to do a really good (a.k.a. big) torrent this weekend or monday if i have time. but yeah, back to work."

,tpbbabu,2013-05-27T05:28Z,"Hi stf , 
well im trying to download your The Living Mummy & Friends, but its stuck at 0% for over a week.
Whatever little bit of speed im getting is 0.3 to 1.3 kbps . Not more than than .
I request stf and all seeders to pls seed it in good speed"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-27T21:35Z,"sorry but i don't even have those comics anymore. that was 3.5 months ago, i had to delete them to clear hard drive space for other torrents many weeks ago. but the living mummy torrent is still being seeded 100% by someone else, though. i tried downloading it a moment ago and got 80 kbps."
