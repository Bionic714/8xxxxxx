[MilfSoup] Amber Lynn (Ambers Ink!)

Amber's morning coffee is especially lonely today. While sipping it, she gazes at her new neighbor Scott. Scott is a tattoo artist that has just moved in to the neighborhood. Attracted by his silhouette, she is fiending to acquire some ink. Scott offers her a tattoo for free. That night according to the agreement she shows up to the tattoo parlor for her tattoo. Eager to do it, Scott gets the table ready. Amber strikes a second thought on the event and refuses the ink. Amber then confesses that the plot behind her visit was to get to know Scott better. Oh well... lets put the equipment away and let's fuck.
