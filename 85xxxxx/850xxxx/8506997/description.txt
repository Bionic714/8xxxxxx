Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii AVCHD DTS4.0 rECOn

Source: Original 4-track mix -&gt; DVD-A DVD audio disk

Good sound quality considering the era this was recorded.  Not much extreme high or low end frequencies but otherwise very good sound reproduction.  Not a huge problem, and it does make it easy to turn up the volume.

Changing the format / rECOnstruction was needed as most modern players won't be able to play the original DVD-A material due to copy protection.  MLP audio data was used as the source but not included in this release, just DTS.  The difference in sound quality between the compressed DTS and MLP is barely audible.

The disk is authored as an AVCHD suitable for either BD or DVD / AVCHD media.  Animated titles are used for video.  Chapters are included.
