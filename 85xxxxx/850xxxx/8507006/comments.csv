,dreamingscene,2013-05-25T14:51Z,"Killer!  Ty so much for uploading all of these in this quality.  Lossless or nothing for me.  If only more people did this.  Adams read these wonderfully too, very amusing.  I've been a fan since I first read the books over 26 years ago, but I never heard these audios.  thanks again"
,piratebuddha,2013-05-25T16:03Z,"@dreamingscene You're very welcome. I spent over $150 to get all these discs and put this together because I love Douglas Adams and I want these books to be available for everyone to enjoy, not just the few who can afford to track them down. 

And I agree with you about loseless audio. I would NEVER upload, or even listen to, music in shitty, lossy quality. To me, listening to music in lossy quality is an insult to the artist and it's as absurd as trying to compare a photocopy of a Van Gogh painting to the original. "
,b.c.e.,2013-05-25T23:01Z,"Finish listening to the first CD. Great quality. Downloading the other Douglas Adams ones. Thanks a lot @dreamingscene for all these wonderful Flac´s.
I cant agree more, loseless is the way to go. Its so sad to find great audiobooks in 64bit mp3 format (don't even bother to download them)."
,woofwoofwoof,2013-05-27T02:56Z,"Many thanks!  I had the MP3 version of this but it was missing parts and low quality.  Happy to get these now, though the books read by Martin Freeman are really good too."
,piratebuddha,2013-05-27T21:38Z,"@woofwoofwoof I actually prefer the Stephen Fry, Martin Freeman versions, but I still wanted to track these down because it's awesome to hear Adams read them in his own voice.

I don't know if you saw these but I also upload all 5 Stephen Fry, Martin Freeman audiobooks in FLAC here:
