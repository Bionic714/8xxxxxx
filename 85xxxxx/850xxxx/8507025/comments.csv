TNe and his mates trashing theese UFO bundles I do at KAT so if you want to support me and post some real comments head one over and have your say

in fact wouldnt hrt if some of you posted here on each torrent so others can decide if they are rubbish or worth having in their collections.. true ufologists or not?"
[V],psspss,2013-05-25T16:11Z,"

Its sad Kat allows anon comment postings.. really how lame is that.. 

I mean head on over.. too :)

Note! they arent always from Youtube in the bundles.. despite what they are claiming else where and many want a Non youtube version to watch on their own players anyhow

getting late.. been busy all day with video stuff"

,patapum,2013-05-25T19:52Z,"i have to say that i like your videos... and people who don't search videos by themselfs are not going to understand the hard work you do.

there's not much public info out there, anyway you find a lot.

Also i'd like to appeal the UFO community to rip any DVD from any conference just because there is less than 30% of that 100%.

,bielzibob,2013-05-25T20:12Z,O GREAT ONE PLEASE: HARDCORE PAWN EP. 8.
[V],psspss,2013-05-26T02:37Z,"ep8 of hardcore didnt air.. right no more on hardcore.. comments will get ignored now

im not in usa either remember

yeh it takes years if not at all for ufo congress conference leaks

I think people find it easier to upload to youtube thats when people like me can source it and convert back to the portable version again

some things are out there though. much of Kerrys seems to be and all that ancient alien stuff. I think Ive put up some debunker stuff in the bundles to prove that humans could do stone moving with clever thinking and levers
i think perhaps the time lines are out though how long it took to build a pyramid like.. 100 years no 20 etc

make sure to watch alien aliens debunked.. its very good docu movie. its one i didnt add to a bundle since it was up but maybe I add it in a bundle my converted version next month"
