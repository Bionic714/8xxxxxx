Mostly Harmless audiobook, UNABRIDGED, read by Douglas Adams himself.

All 5 CD's were ripped to FLAC by me, using Exact Audio Copy. Logs and CUE for each individual CD are included.

I ripped each CD into a single FLAC file for a reason: These CD's were originally indexed at intervals of approximately 3 minutes instead of by chapter, which, in my humble opinion, is pointless. 
However I have included the CUE sheet for each individual CD in the event that any of you wish to split the files into individual tracks. This can easily be done with one of many programs like 'Medieval CUE Splitter' which you can find here on the Pirate Bay.

I apologize for any inconvenience but I did my best to acquire all these discs and provide you all with these hard to find audiobooks, read by Douglas Adams himself in crisp, loseless audio.

Please seed to at least 100% after you finishing downloading so that all the other hoopy froods can also enjoy!
