The Famous Comedian is back with a 93 minute powerhouse set, recorded live at The Bell House in Brooklyn and presented here without any edits. The two-disc package captures an expanded and looser delivery of his "Laboring Under Delusions" set, including over 10 minutes of unplanned riffing. An absolutely essential document for any PFT fan!
