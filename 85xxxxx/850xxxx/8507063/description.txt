Ali Jihad Racy: An accomplished multi-instrumentalist, Racy has done much to promote an appreciation for Middle Eastern music in the West. Born in Lebanon, Racy came to the US in 1968, where he earned his Masters and Doctorate degrees from the University of Illinois before accepting a position as Professor of Ethnimusicology at UCLA. His recordings for various labels provide a showcase for his mastery of the flute-like nay and the clarinet-like mijwiz, as well as the stringed instruments 'ud and buzuq, both important to Middle Eastern styles. Racy is currently working on a book tentatively titled The Art of Ecstacy in Arab Music. ~ Linda Kohanov, All Music Guide
