,Rinney1,2013-05-27T11:36Z,Cams a cam.. Not a bad one.. Except for the fact that the whole audience seems to have influenza and can't stop coughing.. Also i believe the Filmer has Parkinson disease and shakes the camera and moves it when its perfect... but meh....bearable!   
,MrJumper,2013-06-05T18:39Z,"ok, if ya just can't wait it is somewhat watchable, however it looks as if the person who did the capturing was holding the cam the entire time and kept dozing off, why use a good cam but not keep the damn thing still.....Thanx for your time but please take some No-Doze or drink some coffee next time, lol"
