using the lame codec from mediamonkey!!!
The result was this awesome collection in FLAC""

So if I understand correctly you apparantly found crappy MP3 clips and using the lame codec which has always been an MP3 encoder you converted MP3 to FLAC?

Sound's like you may not have a full understanding of the difference between lossy audio compression (MP3 and a crappy one at that) and loseless (FLAC)."
,Pitufo7777,2013-05-25T08:21Z,"well actually idm downloaded it as flash video and when i played it with vlc it said undf not supported you cant do anything about it but it played anyway!so that surprised me.And since i just reinstalled windows when i installed goldwave like 5 minutes earlier goldwave told me it could not find lame whatever so i installed mediamonkey then browsed in goldwave for the lame.dll in c:/program files/mediamonkey,goldwave said cool now we can convert your fucked up flash video whatever files to audio.so i chose FLAC because my enlarged left nut itched.Then i went back online to the 30 second clip website that wanted to charge me for this relic like 1 to 2 dollars a song and copy and pasted it to notepad then opened the military band folder and proceeded to give all 24 songs their proper names.I was just surprised that IDM lets you get the whole song and not the 30 second preview thats all man.And i did it on a piece of shit Dell Dimension 1100 thats 8 years old and ready to shit the bed and i havent slept in 2 days and new mexico sucks ass and people owe me money.......so back off dude!!!!!!"
