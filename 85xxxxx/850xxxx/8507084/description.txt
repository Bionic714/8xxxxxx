For You Military Music fans here is a special treat that took me over
2 hours of internet hustle to get,convert,
save,rename and all that jazz.
30 second samples my butt.Not here!!!
My father used to have this 2 record set and
I remember loving it when i was
a kid.
I think these are the best versions of these
ensembles out there.
I used IDM to download.I used goldwave to convert
using the lame codec from mediamonkey!!!
The result was this awesome collection in FLAC

Please SEED my friends and share
