James Brown's Funky People, Pt. 3 collects more funky tracks from Brown's early '70s People label, which included Vicki Anderson, Hank Ballard and the Dapps, Lyn Collins, and the Dee Felice Trio. 
The album opens with the hard-to-find "rock" version of Brown's "Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'," which was withdrawn within days of its release, and also includes a previously unreleased, undubbed version of Fred Wesley & the J.B.s' "Blow Your Head." 
Rare singles such as Sweet Charles' "Hang out & Hustle" and Beau Dollar's "Who Knows" complete this collection, which consists entirely of songs that have never appeared on CD before. (AMG)
