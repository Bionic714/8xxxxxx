,anluis,2013-05-25T18:19Z,Thank you for this great upload. The patch doesn't work. After patching it still says it's a 30 day trial version. I tried everything and no luck yet. Any ideas of how to get the patch to work?

,anluis,2013-05-26T16:02Z,I tried it running as administrator before I posted the comment and it did not work. I'm on Windows 8 Pro. I tried it again just now and it did not work.
