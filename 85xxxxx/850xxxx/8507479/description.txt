The Class 3F Jinty for Train Simulator, developed by Meshtools, is available in BR early, mid and late liveries, as well as a BR late polished livery, LMS early and late liveries, and National Coal Board orange livery. The model comes in two variants - a standard easy-to-use version that is fully HUD and Xbox controller compatible, and a highly realistic version that will give you a highly realistic steam driving experience. Also included are a 12t Open Wagon, 12t Wagon with Tarp, Box Van and Brake Van. All freight wagons are available with and without loads, and in both unfitted grey and bauxite fitted variants.

The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the LMS Class 3F Jinty on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Western Lines of Scotland (available separately and required to play these scenarios).
