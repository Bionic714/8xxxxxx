,maddog7777,2013-05-26T01:45Z,"Great upload, but bad crack! Crack is fudged up. First time using this plane and like it, but no gauges is considered no good...lol unless you like to fly in the dark so to speak. :) Blacked out gauges is not good. :("
,maddog7777,2013-05-26T02:07Z,"I also noticed something else weird. When you click on the clock gauge next to the DME  Gauge, the screen goes black and the terrain and game data reloads..lmao... I also notice that many of the switches that should be controllable are not accessible. I do not think that is because of the dll fle, but the gauges not working would be an issue with the Super80Pro.dll file. Did anyone resolve this yet before I use hex editor to open it and see where the problem is. "
