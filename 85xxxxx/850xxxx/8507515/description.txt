Former Blasters guitarist Dave Alvin's deep, honest, no-bull vocal style provides the perfect vehicle for his musically adept and emotionally sincere songwriting on BLACKJACK DAVID. Produced by Greg Leisz, the album's eleven majestic cuts represent the best of what country and folk are all about--gutsy and real, powerful and brave, no production tricks, just pure, suberbly-crafted music.
A striking feature of BLACKJACK DAVID is its use of wide open spaces--each song stretches and breathes, and each story ebbs and swells within a wide dynamic range. The wistful "Abilene" uses harmonium swells and tremolo guitar (courtesy of Leisz, who dips into a wide sonic pallette throughout the album) to propel its nomadic narrative. "Evening Blues," an elegant acoustic number, sticks to gentle, evocative fingerpicking and harmonics, fleshed out with accordion and gentle percussion.
