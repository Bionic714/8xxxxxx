,MuseDTPT,2013-05-26T01:59Z,Is this actually from the CD itself? 
,4rror,2013-05-31T09:43Z,"@MuseDTPT: Admittedly I'm not the most well informed here, but what exactly is your question?
Noticed you asked the same thing on a number of torrents."
,Garler,2013-06-04T01:13Z,"If the source is WEB, it most likely means the files came from a legitimate source, (like the bandcamp service)"
,botoxbutox,2013-06-06T05:17Z,"Yeah, I agree w/ Muse*. Who wants to download something that is not legit?"
,Wheeelzz,2013-06-08T23:03Z,"I believe this is a FLAC rip off the album itself, he has an even higher quality (vinyl) FLAC version on his page. "
