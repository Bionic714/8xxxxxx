description:

Full color fold-outs of four superb Russian icons combine with the studied reflections of Henri J.M. Nouwen to offer the reader a unique way to pray with sacred images as much as with words. The meditations are the fruit of Nouwen's long viewing of the icons as the iconographer intended--as holy places, not as decorations.

Note: the four icons that are the subject of these meditations are included as pages at the end of the pdf file, and also as separate high resolution jpg files.
