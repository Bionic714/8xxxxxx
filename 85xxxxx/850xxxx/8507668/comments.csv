,roltzeji,2013-05-25T21:35Z,"Delia666, uninstall and install the game as administrator and then you will get it to work.

I have another problem though. I did change the language to English through regedit but it only changed the text to English. The audio is still in Russian. Is there anyone who can help me change audio to English language?"

,ai2006,2013-05-29T02:22Z,"This torrent does not work.

I don't get the above mentioned problems and did everything with administrator privileges, but the game crashes on start-up.

Audio languages does not seem to be changeable either, though that hardly matters if most people can't get it to work.

Trash torrent, avoid."
