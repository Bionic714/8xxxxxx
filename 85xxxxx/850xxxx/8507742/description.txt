Plot:
The collection starts off with Toriko and company still inside a Regal Mammoth searching for Jewel Meat, a rare piece of meat that has all of the best properties of every other cut.  Things are looking bad; not because they are inside a giant animal, but because a powerful GT Robot sent by the Gourmet Corp is also searching for the elusive ingredient.  The GT is tough and merciless.  It massacres Rin and when she confesses to Toriko with her dying breath that she's happy to have had the chance to fight along side him, it sends the Gourmet Hunter into a rage and even that isn't enough to defeat the monster....
