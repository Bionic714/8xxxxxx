Sad. Just so sad. and so many fails
1. Spamming the porn channel with non porn links
2. Claiming `dubstep"" as electronic
3. Claiming hiphop as music before electronic..
4. Trying to pass off Either of the two as music when they are just derivatives of bad music that was in turn derived from earlier works.

Hiphop is just a spin off of rap, which was a spin off of funk  which was spawned by Disco which came out of the technological wasteland of the 70's.

And Dub-a-wub-a-wub boom thud boom step as as musical as an alley cat routing through tin cans"
