I think it is great that someone takes the time to translate the English of the episode into the Dutch language and sync the subtitles to the video. The only concern I have is why do you hard code them (ie:  BURN) the sub-titles into the movie itself so that no one else can modify the text color size and text border colors to make the sub-titles easier for them to read (for example some people are color blind and might prefer to adjust or view the sub-titles using different colors, font sizes or even different fonts that they might find easier to read).

I suggest that you continue to supply the Dutch sub-titles with your torrents but suggest that you include them as "".sub"" or another popular sub-title format. Burning them or hard-coding them into the video itself is not very user friendly and gives the user no control of how the sub-titles are viewed over the video.
