,volvo122,2013-05-25T11:15Z,"thank you for the nba games, great job. one question why do you download game 1 again with game 2? I've been downloading the 720p fs 23? because you were doing 1 game at a time."
,Dimmis80,2013-05-25T14:50Z,"Btw the 60FPS games goes very fast for me even with the small number of seeders prior to the simple version.!1.1MB now ETA only 50 minutes.And u guys if u only want to download game 2 do this.Go to your bit torrent program start downloading and when u see in the down section the 2 games showing stop downloading.Go to the down section right click game 1 and click to ""Dont download"".With that way u will only download the second game.Give it a try is very easy.."

,volvo122,2013-05-26T01:04Z,Thanks Dimmis80 for the lesson on how to use my Utorrent. 
[V],Nepotu,2013-05-26T01:42Z,"You're all welcome, my friends! And thank you Dimmis80 for helping me to explain again and again how to DL only the last game. It's not my fault that the ripper choose to put all the games of the series in every torrent. We have to thank him for his work and do our best to helping him by seeding. Cheers to all my friends from TPB!"
