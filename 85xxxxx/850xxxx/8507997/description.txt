Mountbatten describes his ties with the Russian Imperial family, and the shock felt by the British Royalty at their deposition and eventual murder. With the entry of USA into the war, Mountbatten visits the Western front with Haig (not shown), before the July offensive leading to the armistice. Mountbatten, "looking forward to having some fun" after the restrictions of wartime naval life, spends two terms at Cambridge before accompanying the Prince of Wales on his 1920 world tour. On his return he is put in charge of a small naval force during the 1921 state of emergency, and then on HMS Repulse, at the time of the death of his father (reinstated as Admiral of the Fleet). Mountbatten is invited on the second Prince of Wales tour, which takes in India, where he discovers the pleasures of polo, and proposes to Edwina Ashley, whom he marries on his return. Their honeymoon is spent at Broadlands (her family home), in Europe and in America. Their stay in Hollywood (at "Pickfair") is recorded in a "home movie" made by their host Chaplin, and involving the house guests.
