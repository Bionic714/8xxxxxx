This double DVD consists of recordings cut at the Zeche in Bochum on January 25, 2004 - the night that Rage performed an over three-hour show, playing the most important tracks from every phase of the band's career, some of them original arrangements, others updated versions. The band, featuring an international line-up unique to the metal scene, demonstrated all over again just what a technically accomplished act they are.
