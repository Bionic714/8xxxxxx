Uploader, appreciate your post, and that you've abandoned DivX wrapped avi and use 264/mp4... but because of the profile you chose, this rip is completely worthless for most downloaders. You ripped to 480p so the profile you chose makes no sense, and it mostly isn't going to work on most consumer players. 

High Profile (HiP)
The primary profile for broadcast and disc storage applications, particularly for high-definition television applications (for example, this is the profile adopted by the Blu-ray Disc storage format and the DVB HDTV broadcast service).
Progressive High Profile (PHiP)
Similar to the High profile, but without support of field coding features.
Constrained High Profile
Similar to the Progressive High profile, but without support of B (bi-predictive) slices.
High 10 Profile (Hi10P)
Going beyond typical mainstream consumer product capabilities, this profile builds on top of the High Profile, adding support for up to 10 bits per sample of decoded picture precision.


What you want is Main Profile, or Baseline... that's profile levels 4 or 3, especially for 480p stuff. 

Again, thanks for the effort... but keep at it. Chosing the max settings isn't always optimum. "
