Throughout ΓÇ£WhirlwindΓÇ¥, the third song on Xenia RubinosΓÇÖ debut album Magic Trix, thereΓÇÖs a joyous vocal choppiness that darts between speakers like a figure in a stop-motion film. ThereΓÇÖs the seesawing groan of a squeaky door, low, crunching keyboards, and a hectic, roiling drumbeat that Zach Hill wouldn't be ashamed of. When you listen closely, you realize there are words to RubinosΓÇÖ scrambled ululations: ΓÇ£When you get the feelinΓÇÖ that youΓÇÖre startinΓÇÖ to wake up,ΓÇ¥ she trills, like an alarm. ΓÇ£Something I really wanted on this record, and in general, is exuberance,ΓÇ¥ the young Brooklyn-dwelling singer told Rookie recently. She's triumphed unambiguously: Magic Trix is a startling lightning bolt of a record.
There are four primary parts to RubinosΓÇÖ busy sound: her electric, smoky voice; overdriven keyboards, which often seem like electric guitar but aren't; the contributions of syncopation-happy drummer Marco Buccelli and funk-inclined bassist Adam Minkoff. Magic Trix recalls tUnE-yArDs, Battles, Camille, and the melodies of St. VincentΓÇÖs Marry Me remade with a Strange Mercy-era approach-- but true to the recordΓÇÖs title, Rubinos has a wizard's unique flair.
