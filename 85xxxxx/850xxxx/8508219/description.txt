Book Description:

                   Winner of the IACP First Book Award 

* Named one of Cooking Light magazineΓÇÖs Top 100 Cookbooks of the Last 25 Years *


The long-awaited cookbook by Deb Perelman of Smitten KitchenΓÇöhome cook, photographer, and celebrated food blogger.

Deb Perelman loves to cook. She isnΓÇÖt a chef or a restaurant ownerΓÇösheΓÇÖs never even waitressed. Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsΓÇöand, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? YouΓÇÖll get more than three million results. Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe thatΓÇÖs downright bad?

So Deb founded her award-winning blog, Smitten Kitchen, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor canΓÇöand shouldΓÇöbe delicious . . . every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to creating and finding the best of the best and adapting the recipes for the everyday cook.
And now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbook: more than 100 recipesΓÇöalmost entirely new, plus a few favorites from the siteΓÇöall gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of her beautiful color photographs.

The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking. Here youΓÇÖll find better uses for your favorite vegetables: asparagus blanketing a pizza; ratatouille dressing up a sandwich; cauliflower masquerading as pesto. These are recipes youΓÇÖll bookmark and use so often they become your own, recipes youΓÇÖll slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws, and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time. Deb tells you her favorite summer cocktail; how to lose your fear of cooking for a crowd; and the essential items you need for your own kitchen. From salads and slaws that make perfect side dishes (or a full meal) to savory tarts and galettes; from Mushroom Bourguignon to Chocolate Hazelnut Crepe Cake, Deb knows just the thing for a Tuesday night, or your most special occasion.
