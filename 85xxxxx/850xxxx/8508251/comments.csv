,nihilizm,2013-05-26T07:30Z,oooh Christian how low can you go 
,village1diot,2013-05-26T07:42Z,"It doesn't even have an IMDB rating. Of course you would know that if you weren't a spamming douche-bag, jimbur"
,ZizzyTheNo0b,2013-05-26T13:51Z,"a/v/m guys?

,GrandMasterTaft,2013-05-26T16:08Z,"A: 7.5 good but, distorts now and then
V:9
M: 7(ish) 

wow, pretty much an exact B grade version of Alien - without the alien of course - just some guy... vaguely watchable (Alien is one of the best movies ever after all) - but what do you expect from a movie with christian slater"
,GrandMasterTaft,2013-05-26T16:53Z,M: 6 - just watched the end...
,DrMD,2013-05-26T23:38Z,"This POS fuckin stinks M=2, watch it in FF or you'll never get back your time and you really ain't missing a thing better yet don't even DL this crap. A/V=7, Too bad all their little special effects miniatures get wrecked in the first few minutes which was enough for me to speed things up."
,ottawaguy2014,2013-05-27T06:29Z,lol umad bro maybe its just not your type of movie so stop bitching 
,Polyblendz,2013-05-27T17:06Z,"Great V/A 9/10
For those complaining about how horrible this movie is... I AGREE lol but do yourself a favor you going to download it anyway to see how right I am lol"
,eldon907,2013-05-27T21:18Z,Thank you
,mrmeade,2013-05-27T21:43Z,"Shit movie, shit thunderbird style special effects, why do good actors stoop this low. can they not see its shit when their on set ?"
,pawn3d,2013-05-27T22:43Z,"A movie starring Christian Slater, but no box cover on IMDB... Weirdness."
,Ssgtmcnasty,2013-05-28T07:04Z,"Great quality and thanks for the upload, but there's one thing....

I don't usually comment on the movie itself, but this was by far the biggest piece of shit I have seen in some time. It actually made me feel embarrassed for the actors that they are now immortalized in this utter trash bin of a movie."
,novobay,2013-05-28T10:46Z,From the director of Battlefield Earth...
,uheardmebitch,2013-05-28T19:23Z,"wasn't as bad as people are making out. it's like a 5/10 maybe 6. it has some good moments but some irritating character habits, and u feel like slapping them all in the end. plot is the usual fare"
,charley0,2013-05-29T22:42Z,"Excellent quality, thanks *S"
,highlander888,2013-05-31T16:42Z,"Thanks for the upload!

M: 4, A poor man's Alien movie."
,PlutosCharm,2013-06-01T08:25Z,I guess it's a good watch if you're bored but have already jerked off..
,Durendal123,2013-06-02T21:06Z,"@Grandmastertaft

agreed, this is a B (or C) version of the movie Alien. But as for Christian Slater, he's been in good movies like True Romance and ... and... Okay well he's been in a good movie is the point!"
,Valahas,2013-06-04T16:42Z,"A V 9, 8 M-3"
