
Grab your spatula and get ready for a burger-flipping adventure! In this brand-new edition of Papa's Burgeria, you are unwillingly left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria. You'll need to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve the burgers to all of your wacky customers.

This hands-on time-management game gives you control at each step of the burger-building process. You'll need to multi-task and juggle between each area of the restaurant: Keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby, drag and flip burger patties on the grill to cook them just right, and add toppings and sauces to the sandwiches before serving them to your customers!

Keep your customers happy to earn more points and level up! As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!

At the end of each day, you'll also be faced with Closer customers who are very picky about their burgers, and each week you'll be visited by the Food Critic with a chance to earn a tip-boosting Blue Ribbon!

Use your hard-earned tips to buy restaurant upgrades and hats to wear, and you can also decorate your lobby with furniture and posters from the Furniture Shop. You'll even earn a Pay Day each week, which you can spend on upgrading your Burgeria!

You'll also be able to earn 70 different achievements for various tasks in the Burgeria, including reaching certain ranks, earning Customer Awards on your customers, playing mini-games, and serving burgers with certain toppings.
