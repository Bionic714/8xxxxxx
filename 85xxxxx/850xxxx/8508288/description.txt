"It is a flat share sitcom: Matthew is a self obsessed agoraphobic of private means, who is an old school friend of naïve and well meaning Martin, who he treats as something of a slave.

Martin's sister's best friend Mandy lives with them: she's a beautiful, ambitious wannabe career woman.

Critics of the show felt that the characters weren't likeable enough, particularly Matthew, who has very few redeeming features, despite Ben Chaplin investing him with a certain charm.
The original Game On cast

Chaplin left after series one when Hollywood beckoned, and Neil Stuke (who had originally auditioned for the role and only narrowly lost out in the first place) replaced him.

Much of the comedy revolved around sexual issues. The boys get very little action: Matthew because he is slightly unhinged and Martin because he is painfully shy and inexperienced.

Mandy, despite her looks and drive, is deeply insecure and prone to ill-considered dalliances with inappropriate men.

There is a refreshingly defeatist tone about Game On. The characters ultimately fail to prosper because of their own shortcomings and there are no fairy tale endings.
