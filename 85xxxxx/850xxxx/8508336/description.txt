Rammstein is an industrial metal band from Berlin, Germany. The band was formed in 1994 and consists of Till Lindemann (lead vocals), Richard Z. Kruspe (guitar and backing vocals), Paul H. Landers (guitar, backing vocals), Oliver "Ollie" Riedel (bass guitar), Christoph "Doom" Schneider (drums and electronic percussion) and Christian "Flake" Lorenz (keyboards).

Their songs are usually in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in other languages such as English, Spanish, French and Russian. As of 2009, they have sold over 20 million records worldwide. Rammstein's live shows are famous for their pyrotechnic performance and theatrics, earning them awards from many countries. Rammstein's entire catalogue is published by Universal Music Group. Since their formation in 1994, Rammstein has had no changes in their band line-up. The band have stated they were named after the Ramstein air-show disaster. The extra "m" in the band's name makes it translate literally as "ramming stone".
