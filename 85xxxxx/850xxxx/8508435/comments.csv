[V],globeplus,2013-05-26T00:00Z,"Hi wherever you are and thank you for your comments , i upload some game files here and there and sometimes the game is presented in arc archive because the best possible compression to the presented game and the downloaders sometimes don´t had the freearc the freeware needed for extract the arc archive installed on the computer , so i decided to make a tool myself more simple as possible for arc extraction and i put my attention on it and i made it the Drop your arc archive on this executable tool that i can use now inside the game files but the basis that i used to make this arc tool looked simple and addictive in the way that with some more research and helping extractors was possible even more archives be extracted in drag and drop style easily and so i did it , i included a few more extractors and arranged the code , maked tests for each one of the type of archives and it is done a very simple tool that let 12 archives types be extracted at the archive folder with just a drag and drop procedure of the archive to be extracted at the tool and that it is a beauty ... sometimes we all find out great pleasure in little things and i think this is one of the cases , i simply tought to myself that all the time spended in research to make this tool was worthy and in the end i get premiated with this lovely pratic tool ... i wish more fun with the computer as possible for all of you and it is a pleasure make tools or files that can be in handy to someone else too and that just for the pleasure of sharing and when we get the work well done we feel even better ... happy files to all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-26T00:29Z,"Hi again and this comment it is to say a little curiosity about this tool : if you stop your mouse cursor on the tool and gives a little click with the cursor still stopped on the tool the file description shows up on the cursor and tells all the possible type of archives that can be extracted by the tool , that can helps if the user have doubts about a certain type of archive that can be extracted or not ... have fun ..."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-26T23:35Z,"Hi toto1980 and the answer it is just for information , maybe you got in a download on the net a tar file for example then you can check if you not shore at the file description if tar archives are ok for extraction and that is valid for any archive type , of course that the most common ones are included as 7zip, zip, rar or arc archives but maybe in one or other case like if you are a lynux user for example the other archives extraction can be useful too ... see you around and happy applications to you ..."
