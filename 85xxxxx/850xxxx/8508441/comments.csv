,pxpierre,2013-05-26T01:59Z,"Thank you footy & seeders!

FU NordicF1, a real jerk never grateful, never saying thanks, always asking for more or spamming torrent comments w/ links going elsewhere or criticizing.

Mouth full & asking for more while not even swallowed yet what he got for free. I bet you are a kiddie from USA.

I see in your profile that you have a big bunch of unseeded torrents."
