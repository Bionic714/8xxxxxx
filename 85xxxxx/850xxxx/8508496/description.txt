Hey baby, Little Steven here, and this weekend in the Underground Garage we are celebrating the cool tones and textures of the greatest guitarists ever.

It is not something you think about anymore because the whole world has become homogenized, but once upon a time everyone had a cool sound.

Tune in while we check out Buffalo Springfield, the Kinks, the Byrds, and the Hollies.

Brand new music from the Connection, Wyldlife, the Woggles, the Trashed Romeos, and Baby Woodrose.

We are celebrating tone and texture in the world's only Rock n' Roll dance party on the radio.

I will see you this weekend in the Underground Garage.
