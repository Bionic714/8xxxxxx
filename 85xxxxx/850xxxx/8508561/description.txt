   This volume focuses on the broad pattern of increasing biodiversity       
   through time, and recurrent events of minor and major ecosphere           
   reorganization. Intense scrutiny is devoted to the pattern of physical    
   (including isotopic), sedimentary and biotic circumstances through the    
   time intervals during which life crises occurred. These events affected   
   terrestrial, lacustrine and estuarine ecosystems, locally and globally,   
   but have affected continental shelf ecosystems and even deep ocean        
   ecosystems. The pattern of these events is the backdrop against which     
   modelling the pattern of future environmental change needs to be          
   evaluated.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:
