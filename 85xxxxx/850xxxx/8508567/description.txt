  "Interplanetary Outpost" follows the mission architecture template of      
  NASA's plan for Human Outer Planet Exploration (HOPE), which envisions     
  sending a crew to the moon Callisto to conduct exploration and sample      
  return activities. To realize such a mission, the spacecraft will be the   
  most complex interplanetary vehicle ever built, representing the best      
  technical efforts of several nations. A wealth of new technologies will    
  need to be developed, including new propulsion systems, hibernation        
  strategies, and revolutionary radiation shielding materials. Step by       
  step, the book will describe how the mission architecture will evolve,     
  how crews will be selected and trained, and what the mission will entail   
  from launch to landing. However, the focus of "Interplanetary Outpost"     
  is on the human element. The extended duration, logistical challenges,     
  radiation concerns, communication lag times, isolation, and deleterious    
  effects on the human body will conspire to not only significantly impair   
  human performance but also affect the behavior of crewmembers. This book   
  addresses each of these issues in detail while still providing the         
  reader with a background to the necessary elements comprising such a       
  mission.
