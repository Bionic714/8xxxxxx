 : Remix Theory: The Aesthetics of Sampling is an analysis of Remix in art,   :
 : music, and new media. Navas argues that Remix, as a form of discourse,     :
 : affects culture in ways that go beyond the basic recombination of material.:
 : His investigation locates the roots of Remix in early forms of mechanical  :
 : reproduction, in seven stages, beginning in the nineteenth century with the:
 : development of the photo camera and the phonograph, leading to contemporary:
 : remix culture. This book places particular emphasis on the rise of Remix in:
 : music during the 1970s and '80s in relation to art and media at the        :
 : beginning of the twenty-first Century. Navas argues that Remix is a type of:
 : binder, a cultural glueΓÇöa virusΓÇöthat informs and supports contemporary     :
 : culture.                                                                   :
