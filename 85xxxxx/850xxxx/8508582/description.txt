 : Solid Modelling and CAD Systems gives users an insight into the methods and:
 : problems associated with CAD systems. It acts as a bridge between users who:
 : learn interfaces without understanding how they work and developers who    :
 : create systems without understanding the needs of the users.               :
 :                                                                            :
 : The main feature of Solid Modelling and CAD Systems is a logical analysis  :
 : of the techniques and basic solid modelling methods used in modern CAD     :
 : systems.  The book goes on to describe, among other subjects:              :
