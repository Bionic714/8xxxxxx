 : If you have ever wondered how we get from the awesome impersonality of the :
 : Big Bang universe to the point where living creatures can start to form,   :
 : and evolve into beings like you, your friends and your family, wonder no   :
 : more. Steve Miller provides us with a tour through the chemical evolution  :
 : of the universe, from the formation of the first molecules all the way to  :
 : the chemicals required for life to evolve. Using a simple Hydrogen molecule:
 : - known as H-three-plus - as a guide, he takes us on a journey that starts :
