A little over 5 years ago I started my web comic : Fried Fish Comics. All these comics I bundled into 7 comics and give them here away for free. Hope you will enjoy and share them. As long as you keep them in their original state you can share the heck out of them. Any publication in another form what so ever only after consulting me of course ;-) 7 comics and 1 sketch book in cbr file. If you want them rather in PDF you can download these from my website: www.friedfishcomics.com
