Notes:

I was going to save this for my 100th encode, but that's still a few weeks away and I can't not post one of my all-time favorite movies. I have already encoded Pi (Aronofsky's other awesome film) but for the longest time could not find a decent source to encode Requiem. Most of the other encodes of this movie (esp. the higher bit rate versions) are plagued with some sort of haze or softening effect which ruins the quality of the video and it took some real digging to finally get my hands on a source that didn't have that problem. Everyone can thank HighCode for that - when I told him there were no decent copies out there, he did a large file size version straight from physical disk, and that's what I've used to encode from. It was excellent work, I just made it a more manageable size. Unless you're watching on a screen upwards of say 50" or so, the quality here should be just fine. If you ARE watching on a huge screen, I recommend HighCode's larger version.

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
