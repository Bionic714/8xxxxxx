Blade Song (Colbana Files #1) by J.C. Daniels (August 1st 2012) 

Kit ColbanaΓÇöhalf breed, assassin, thief, jack of all tradesΓÇöhas a new job: track down the missing ward of one of the local alpha shapeshifters. It should be a piece of cake.

So why is she so nervous? It probably has something to do with the insanity that happens when you deal with shiftersΓÇöespecially sexy ones who come bearing promises of easy jobs and easier money.

Or maybe itΓÇÖs all the other missing kids that Kit discovers while working the case, or the way her gut keeps screaming sheΓÇÖs gotten in over her head. Or maybe itΓÇÖs because if she failsΓÇösheΓÇÖs dead.

If she can stay just one step ahead, she should be okay. Maybe sheΓÇÖll even live long to collect her feeΓÇª 

Night Blade (Colbana Files #2) by J.C. Daniels (March 4th 2013) 

Kit Colbana is always biting off more than she can chew. She has a knack for finding trouble. This time, though, trouble finds her. Someone from her past drops a case into her lap that she just canΓÇÖt refuseΓÇªliterally.

People on the Council are dying left and right and sheΓÇÖs been requested to investigate the deaths. The number one suspect? Her lover, Damon. If she doesn't clear his name, he gets a death sentence. Even if she succeeds? They still might try to execute him. Oh, and sheΓÇÖs not allowed to tell him about the case, either.

The stakes are high this time around, higher than they've ever been. Kit may be forced to pay the ultimate price to save her loverΓÇÖs lifeΓÇªa price that could destroy her and everything she loves. 


Seed and Enjoy!
