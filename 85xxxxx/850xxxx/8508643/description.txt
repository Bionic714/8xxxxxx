Uh Oh!

ItΓÇÖs that time of the year when we talk about money honey.

This is Little Steven, and this weekend in the Underground Garage our theme is money.

Where does it go, and why do we have to pay it to the government when they arenΓÇÖt doing a damn thing for us?

Joining us at the party will be Spinal Tap, the J. Geils Band, the Yardbirds, the Hollies, the Drifters, and the Pretty Things.

Brand new music from the Connection, the Bayonets, the Young Sinclairs, John & Brittany, WyldlifeΓÇªand the Woggles have a new one thatΓÇÖs gonna kill ya.

ItΓÇÖs Money Honey; in the worldΓÇÖs only Rock nΓÇÖ Roll dance party on the radio.

IΓÇÖll see you this weekend in the Underground Garage.
