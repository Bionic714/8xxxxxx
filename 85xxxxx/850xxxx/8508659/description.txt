The Statue of Liberty
For more than 100 years, the Statue of Liberty has been a symbol of hope and refuge for generations of immigrants. In this lyrical, compelling and provocative portrait of the statue, Ken Burns explores both the history of America's premier symbol and the meaning of liberty itself. Featuring rare archival photographs, paintings and drawings, readings from actual diaries, letters and newspapers of the day, the fascinating story of this universally admired monument is told. In interviews with Americans from all walks of life, including former Governor Mario Cuomo, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, writers James Baldwin and Jerry Kosinski, The Statue of Liberty examines the nature of liberty and the significance of the statue to American life.
Nominated for the Academy Award and the Emmy Award.
Winner of the CINE Golden Eagle, Christopher Award, and the Blue Ribbon at the American Film Festival.
