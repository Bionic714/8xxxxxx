Stretching from suburban murders of loved ones to the sinister workings of a serial killer's mind and from a bent cop with a terminal approach to his work to a hitman who gets more than he bargained from in a crowded fairground, these tales not only explore the inner life of a city like no other. For the streets of Edinburgh have seen more than their fair share of blood. With Beggars Banquet, Ian Rankin once again demonstrates all the powers that have made him a consistent number one bestseller.
