The Fuccons, known in Japan as Oh! Mikey (πé¬πâ╝! πâ₧πéñπé¡πâ╝ ┼î! Maik─½), is a series of Japanese comedy sketches created by Yoshimasa Ishibashi featuring a family of Americans ("The Fuccons") living in metropolitan Japan. The series is notable in that all of the characters are played by mannequins with perpetually frozen facial expressions, like the mannequins in the French photographer Bernard Faucon's pictures.
