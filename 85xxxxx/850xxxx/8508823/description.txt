 : The Star Atlas Companion is the ideal companion to any star atlas, as it is:
 : the first book to provide a true perspective on the characteristics and    :
 : distances of over 1,100 stars and their movement through space. With the   :
 : aid of scale diagrams, the reader can grasp difficult-to-understand        :
 : concepts such as how far apart stars really are, their relative sizes, how :
 : fast they spin and their shapes, and how the constellation patterns change :
 : over time. This book:                                                      :

 : - describes many stars visible to the naked eye in both the northern and   :
