,Weston0175,2013-05-26T19:51Z,Any Clay Crosse?
,Weston0175,2013-05-26T21:05Z,"And my brother would like to know if you have any thing by dakoda moter co? Specifically their second album (Welcome race fans)? 
I'll stop driving you up a wall now, TT. 
Thanks for all that you've shared.
I wish tpb would be so influenced by these positive torrents that they'll get rid of the sleazy half-naked women advertised on the side of the website. It's a bit distracting..."

[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-28T18:06Z,"Weston0175, I put up that Adie Camp along with her pre-solo days with Benjamin Gate.  Christine Dente and Dakoda Motor Co are also up for you.  There was already a Clay Cross discography by me a while back.  Check it out.  And I was able to do a Daniel's Window for your sister."
