 : LaTeX is a free, automated state-of-the-art typesetting system. This book  :
 : teaches all the ins and outs of LaTeX which are needed to write an article,:
 : report, thesis, or book. The book teaches by example, giving many worked   :
 : out examples showing input and output side by side. The book presents the  :
 : most recent techniques for presenting data plots, complex graphics, and    :
 : computer presentations, but does not require previous knowledge. However,  :
 : it is also a reference for the more seasoned user, with pointers to modern :
 : techniques and packages. Recurring themes in the book are consistent and   :
 : effective presentation, planning and development, controlling style and    :
 : content, and maintenance.                                                  :
