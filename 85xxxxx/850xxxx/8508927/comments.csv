,godgali,2013-06-07T02:25Z,"that's why it says ""updates"" is title retard...   Thanks for posting"
,trejedy2,2013-06-07T19:42Z,"But ""update"" means that which is included is different than the last time this post was ""updated"". For some reason, with Jab Comix, all posters ever do is include virtually the same episodes of the same handful of comics. I think Dixter's fap has maybe had 2 or three panels added in total for the last 4-5 ""updates"". So, yeah, thanks for posting, but if the comics are no different between each of the ""latest"", you're wasting your efforts. "
,Frink_JohnNerdelbaum,2013-06-10T19:23Z,"Dude, Jab doesn't release stuff all at once, he frequently updates, but it isn't often we get a complete comix. It usually takes months upon months for a complete story. Since manam69 is doing us a solid and posting updates and what not, we should probably stop complaining. 

Thanks, manam69. Your stuff is always good. 

Any chance of getting a complete Keeping It Up with  The Joneses? I think it finally finished the other day. "
,trejedy2,2013-06-12T08:46Z,"I thanked the poster for his work, but I still say if it isn't complete, he probably has better things he could do with his time. Why does a reader need to see a panel or two, in addition to all those that are repeated to flesh out the post? Just wait a few months if that's what it takes.

But, seriously, thank you to the poster for the work. Not intended as a slam on your efforts."
