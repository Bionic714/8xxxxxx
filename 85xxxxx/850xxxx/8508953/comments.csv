,Kingsanx,2013-05-26T06:03Z,Wish you'd start posting screen shots. A lot of these games I have never heard of before. I wanna see what it's about. What it looks like ect.
,ItchyLala,2013-05-26T08:07Z,Wish people who are already getting a free game would take 5 fucking seconds to type the title into Google to find everything they want to know.
,FreeGameFreak77,2013-05-26T11:04Z,I 2nd That Wish +1
,progenx,2013-05-26T14:20Z,"i wish i could just burn u, Kingsanx. lol! lazy bitch!"
,Jugg141,2013-05-26T15:09Z,so copying the name and type it in to google is something that hasn't crossed your mind?
,limneos,2013-05-26T15:48Z,there's no Epic Quest table :(
,pennknig,2013-05-27T01:52Z,"OK,,,I will try and report back.
ALTHOUGH....
This is only available from MS as a W8 download, it doesn't even appear in the W7 category...(?)
I'm running W7, so I'm about to find out if there will be issues.............

Will be installed on:
HP Envy 17-3090NR 3D / ATI CCC v13.4 / TriDef v3.6.23 / Bios F09 / W7 HP x64 SP1

,pennknig,2013-05-27T03:29Z,"OK,,,it works. This IS definitely a W8 game, you will ave to get used to the METRO interface used with W8 and this game.
A bug I found, my arrow pointer disappeared (W7),,,I thought I would have to do a hard shut down/reset. 
Navigation is via your KB unless you have a touch screen.

OK stuff, no PvZ in 3D as the an advert shows, actually, no PvZ table, in this DL.

No Zen Classics that I could find.........
Sorcerer’s Lair
Epic Quest
Earth Defense
Excalibur
Secrets of the Deep
Biolab
Pasha
Rome
Spider-Man
Wolverine
Fantastic Four
Captain America
Thor
The Infinity Gauntlet
World War Hulk
Fear Itself

Stop spamming TPB with your Youtube channel crap, you will get banned..........."
,noekk,2013-05-29T00:07Z,"This works great, at least on my Win8 x64 system. It feels really good using an Xbox 360 controller. I hope there is a way to learn all the rules for each table. I would buy this if it wasn't such a scam and didn't feel like a marketting game (with all the Marvel shit) Thanks Stif and Skidrow."
,Deermud,2013-05-29T19:24Z,"Agreed with pennknig

The release is missing zen classics packs,other than that it's all there.."
,dogoserf,2013-05-30T12:22Z,Excellent pinball game thanks highly recommended with heaps of tables
,Deermud,2013-05-30T15:39Z,"Oops,never mind just found out that the zen classics pack is there,they just don't tell you it's from Zen classics :p"
,pennknig,2013-05-30T22:23Z,"@ Deermud

Most of the tables you listed aren't even available for the PC version.  

The only ones that are available for PC but not included are those that can only be bought individually which are...

Epic Quest (Available on TPB now)
Mars (Not available for the steam version yet)
Earth Defense
Excalibur
Civil War
Sorcerer's Lair
Captain America
Fantastic Four

They should be cracked and made available soon enough."
