I was just gonna tell u i found another very good encoding program

its called IpodMe"
,humantorchid,2013-05-27T20:49Z,"@rr-ne 
Oh, Thanks I Will Surely Try It.
So, Is It Faster Or What???"
[V],rr-ne,2013-05-28T07:23Z,Depends on the type of machine you have. (computer) it take me less than 5 mins to convert a 22 min video
,humantorchid,2013-05-28T18:33Z,"WOW. I've tried It, And Its Really Good. Now I Am Just Playing Around With The Settings To See Which One Will Give Me The Best Quality For The Least Possible Size.
Thanks For Telling Me About This."
,humantorchid,2013-05-28T19:16Z,Do You Mind Telling Me The Setting You Used?
[V],rr-ne,2013-05-28T20:33Z,Do you want the default resolution of the videos?
[V],rr-ne,2013-05-28T20:43Z,"Here is a image link of my settings.

,humantorchid,2013-05-29T18:14Z,"Thanks Bro, But I Have The Exact Same Settings But Cant Seem To Hit Less Than 60MB.
Does The Resolution Matter?? Cuz Mine Is 640x480.
But Anyway...I Am Gonna Try A Few More Combinations...My Aim Is To Get A File Size Less Than 50MB (Like The NIT158 Guy)
If I Ever Hit That, I Am Gonna Let You Know ASAP."
[V],rr-ne,2013-05-29T20:06Z,i think the the bigger the resolution the bigger the size will be..weird
,humantorchid,2013-05-31T20:01Z,Just Hit 52MB.
,humantorchid,2013-05-31T20:37Z,Screw It! I Am Just Gonna Go Back To H.264 Encoder. That Was Way Better.
,NIT158,2013-05-31T22:30Z,"dudes ..  there's also HANDBRAKE which is easy and easier once you save the settings
try that .. even tutorials are available

humantorchid ... I would n't mind  ... in fact thanx for give me credit

BTW .. I think this torrent would have been awesome if the title was better and if the tags were proper"
,j.cury,2013-06-02T00:51Z,"thanks dude, goooood job, seeding 4x"
,humantorchid,2013-06-02T21:52Z,"@NIT158 - You're Welcome. And Do You Mind Telling Me or Giving Me An Example Of What The Tittle and Tags Should Be?
Also, I Will Try HandBrake Soon.
I Am Almost Done With Season 17 Conversions

@j.cury - You're Welcome."
[V],rr-ne,2013-06-03T00:21Z,They should really upgrade to a batching to h264 encoder
,NIT158,2013-06-03T09:03Z,"@humantorchid .. first of all u need to know the use of tags 

whatever word you type in 'tags' , when that word is typed in the search box then your torrent can be seen .. else not 

it is normally useless to type the title name as a tag.. coz the torrent appear anyway

but if you type just ""Simpsons"" in search box your torrent would not appear .. so that would be a good tag .. hope u understood the need for tags

also .. separate tags by commas .. look at the tag you used , you didn't use comma separator hence hence the tag was wasted

tags for this torrents .. eg : Simpsons,season 24 (this would be a waste bcoz it's already in the title) 
"
,NIT158,2013-06-03T09:11Z,"... eg for tags : Simpsons, complete season, 480p (if it is) , (also adding compatibility devices is a good idea)
like iPad,WDTV,iPod, etc. etc..

also you could have added 480p in title
ideal title wud be : The Simpsons complete season 24 HDTV x264

HDTV and x264 are that necessary .. but if it is xvid ..always add it in title ,, people love xvid in avi format

phew .. I shud stop commenting such long ones ... OW my fingers ... hope it helped 
"
,humantorchid,2013-06-03T18:44Z,"@NIT158 - Thanks Alot. It Did Help. Will Surely Do This For Season 17.

@rr-ne - Exactly! I Had To Come Back To My Computer Every 10 Minutes To Add The Conversions."
,NIT158,2013-06-04T11:47Z,"are u talking about 'handbrake'

isn't there an ""add to queue"" option .. u can also see the queued videos with ""Show Queue"" option

once you queue all the videos .. u need not come back to comp. after every 10 mins.

i think this is the problem you r talkin about .. maybe"
,humantorchid,2013-06-05T18:26Z,"@NIT158 - No, I Was Talking About H.264 Converter"
,NIT158,2013-06-05T21:59Z,"try what I said, in handbrake .. you won't have to ""Come Back To My Computer Every 10 Minutes"" .. :)"
[V],rr-ne,2013-06-05T23:34Z,"@humantorchid

[V],rr-ne,2013-06-06T03:28Z,All the time!! never gets old for me
,humantorchid,2013-06-06T19:33Z,How Much Space Did It Take??
[V],rr-ne,2013-06-07T02:28Z,39 GB for 23 Full seasons
,humantorchid,2013-06-07T18:59Z,"Awesome!!! Did You Re-Convert Them, Or Just Put Them As They Were In Your Other Simpsons Account?"
[V],rr-ne,2013-06-08T03:53Z,I have the exact ones from that account. Not bad quality on the PS3 at all
,humantorchid,2013-06-08T19:34Z,Hmmm.. Nice
