For all those requesting the 8th edition Solutions Manual of the McMurry Organic Chemistry Textbook, I have created a PDF version based on the ebook that was offered to me.

Yes, there are pages that have the page width on them every 10 pages but it doesn't interfere with the text.

If you have any comments or problems, please let me know.  Thanks.


Also, if you download this, please seed.  It's expensive for those of us to create these files from textbooks and the more that can benefit from it, the better.  Thanks :)
