The years 1922-1936.

Mountbatten resumes his naval career in 1923 on HMS Revenge in the centre of the storm over the confrontation at Chanak, after the collapse of the Greek army against the Turks, the abdication of King Constantine and the exile of Prince Andrew, Mountbatten's brother-in-law. Mountbatten specialises in signals, produces a series of "newsreels" on board Revenge, indulges in polo, starts a family (his first daughter is born 1924), then moves to Portsmouth as a signals instructor in 1929. Meanwhile the French enter the Ruhr, nationalism begins to take hold in Germany, and the General Strike, the hunger marches and the Invergordon mutiny occur. In 1934 Mountbatten takes his first command (of HMS Daring and then HMS Wishart) and finds himself in Malta during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia; he then returns to England to the Naval Air Division.
