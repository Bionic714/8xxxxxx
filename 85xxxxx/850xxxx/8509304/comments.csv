A 4 
baby crying through most of the movie"
,Kurius_,2013-05-26T04:31Z,Why people bring babies to a movie theater is beyond me. I'll still be checking this one out. Thank you

,tflagger997,2013-05-26T16:03Z,"It would triple the cost of a movie to hire a babysitter too.  Some simply cannot afford that.  But if the baby starts crying then it is up to someone in the audience to grab an employee to get the mother and baby removed until the child is under control.  If the staff will not do it, you simply get a refund (and usually a few free tickets extra)."
,tflagger997,2013-05-26T16:35Z,"This is only 1280x500 so keep the window that small (or smaller).  If you go full screen, it will look blurry (unless you have a small monitor).

Now, if we could get the original 1080p cam with the line audio that is supposedly waiting for a good cam, we might have a winner.  

""Babies, man.  They freak me out!"""

,lizardomanson,2013-06-09T16:40Z,"tflagger997, that's a dumb excuse.

The they just need to wait until someone can take care of their kids, that's the down fall and sacrifice of be a parent. "
