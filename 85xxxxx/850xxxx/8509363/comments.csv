,evildog1,2013-05-27T21:25Z,"hi. can you not just copy a dvd of fast and furious 6? i know it's copy protected but can you please read the tutorial here http://wiki.pcworld.com/index.php/How_to_Successfully_Backup_a_Purchased_Copy-Protected_DVD
not to clone dvd but copy to your pc and upload to this site. if the tutorial is not good. google it. search ""copy protected dvd"""
,stang5litre,2013-05-28T21:15Z,It would not be have copyright protection due to the fact that this is not for sale as a DVD yet. So any copy that is a DVD-Rip would have been made by someone which again would not have copyright protection. Thanks for the upload xxcaution210xx 
,awesomeid,2013-05-29T12:40Z,@evildog1 there's no DVD release until now
