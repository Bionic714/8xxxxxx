,lakers1308,2013-05-26T15:58Z,why is there always a color issue? where the whole screen goes green?
[V],QborT,2013-05-26T16:20Z,"lakers1308 -  Because you don't have the proper codecs.  Get CCCP and Media Player Classic (both easily found through google).

And to the rest.  No I will not upload this aswell, splitting a swarm does nobody any good. "
,dehrehk,2013-05-26T21:45Z,"Should have written ""Attack on Titans"" in the tags, or somewhere, like, QborT. Ain't no one got time to memorize that..."
