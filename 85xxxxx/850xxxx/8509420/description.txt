Ok, so apparently EIC released another disk on the market after screwing 
up mastering the first one. Cover art mentions "De Zaak Alzheimer" having 
Dutch subtitles, an AC3 5.1 audio track and a DTS 5.1 audio track. However,
the disk we used for our release in February only contained the AC3 5.1 
audio track, lacking the DTS track and Dutch subtitles.
This new release is encoded from the newer disk, containing all elements 
mentioned on the back cover. Other than examining the bluray disks, there
is no way you can see any difference between the two disks. Both cases 
and disks are identical to eachother.
