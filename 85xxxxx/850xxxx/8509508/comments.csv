,iPlunder,2013-05-26T03:49Z,"Since this is your first upload, I'll go easy on you and just say you need to include a description of what the app does, and a link to the website is always helpful."

Play Pandora from your Mac menu bar.

NOTE: Due to actions by Pandora.com, PandaBar is no longer available for download from the Mac App Store. I am in process of trying to work with Pandora on bringing PandaBar back. I will update this page if PandaBar becomes available for download in the future. Email me at vishal@mahasoftware.com if you have any questions.


Play your Pandora stations. Control song playback and give your songs thumbs up/down ratings.

A native app for Mac that stays in your menu bar (and doesn't clutter your dock while it's running).

Keyboard shortcuts for everything! You can even use the media keys on your Apple keyboard.



Use your Apple remote to control PandaBar. Control song playback, show PandaBar, even give ratings.

Growl. Show Growl notifications for new song plays and when you rate a song."
