FIXED TORRENT and seeding this one as of 5/23/2013.

This zip file contains an application called "PandaBar" ; which does not require a key or a serial as far as I know. Please comment if you encounter an issue there.

I just copied this to my Applications folder. Works in Mountain Lion 10.8.3.

Virus scanned with (Mac) Symantec Endpoint Protection 12, definition file 5/24/13 R03.

I am uploading because I couldn't find any version after 1.2.9 out there, and I stumbled on an Internet cafe running the last version (1.3.0) before Pandabar was discontinued.
