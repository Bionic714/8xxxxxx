
This pack is one of the best ..K J Sawka.. if you havent heard him yet you should download this .


Recycle REX2 24 bit unless otherwise stated.

These loops have been optimized for use with Spectrasonics Stylus RMX  VST. Some file names have been changed to comply 

with the Stylus RMX Sage Converter filename limitations. The Packs have been organized to allow the user to drag and 

drop directly into the Sage Converter. Use of the packs with other software such as Propellerheads Reason is possible 

but not optimized!. These packs do NOT contain any wav files and, as ever, if you use and like them please support the 

artist concerned and buy the original from their website.More packs will be added soon and requests can be made in the

comments section. Most rex2 files in the collections are 24 bit unless otherwise stated and some contain the relevant 

midi files if included with the original release. 
These packs are not originals and i do not claim to be the original uploader!! NUFF Respect to the original uploader !!! 

(as always)....Unfortunately the original tags from individual uploaders had been erased before the making of these 

re-packs and they cannot be credited....Anyone feeling aggrieved at this is welcome to be in touch but unfortunately it 

was out of my control before i was able to re-pack them!


Enjoy!
