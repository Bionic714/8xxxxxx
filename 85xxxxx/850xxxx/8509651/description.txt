Atchafalaya Houseboat Documentary - 2006

This journey back in time goes deep into Louisiana's million-acre Atchafalaya Swamp for an adventure with writer Gwen Roland, who 30 years earlier built a houseboat by hand and lived as her forebears had generations earlier. Roland's heritage provides an unusual backdrop for a universal story of self-discovery and the embrace of youthful idealism and a simpler life. The program features images by National Geographic photographer C.C. Lockwood.
