Highlights of this show include the first public #41 preceded by #40 and a substantial mini set of Recently&gt;Water into Wine&gt;Lie In Our Graves. This show marks the band's first return to the Southeast after a lengthy time away, touring in Europe and elsewhere around the US. The show is comprised of solid performances from each band member in front of a lively audience. This particular release is a restoration of sorts, being a mix of the soundboard and an incomplete multi-track recording. 4.7.95 Cameron Indoor Stadium, Durham, NC has been digitally mastered and is available in its entirety.
