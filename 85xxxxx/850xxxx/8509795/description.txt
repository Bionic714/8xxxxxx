     For all the lovers of Korean TV shows, especially fans of Running Man, I'm sure you will enjoy this series if you haven't already.  But for anyone unfamiliar with the show:

     Family Outing Season 1 (Korean: øî¿δ░Çδª¼Ω░Ç δû┤δïñ; literally Family's Here) was a South Korean variety show; a part of SBS's Good Sunday lineup, along with Gold Miss is Coming (Ω│¿δô£δ»╕∞èñΩ░Ç Ω░äδïñ). It was first aired on June 15, 2008, and was one of the top rated programs on Sunday Korean television. In each episode, the "Family" travels to different parts of South Korea and takes care of the house of an elderly family while that family goes on a vacation. The "Family" then accomplishes the tasks left for them by the house's owners. The first season ended on February 14, 2010, and a second season featuring a brand new cast, production team, and concept, aired until July 11, 2010.
