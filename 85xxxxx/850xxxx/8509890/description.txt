If  you  are  going  to  install  English  version  of  Win7, then choose
English  in the "Language to install" window. If you are going to install
Russian  version, then choose Russian language instead. The choice of the
installer  interface  language  at the very beginning will not affect the
installation process.
Do  not try to install x86 version with x64 installer (UEFI-mode uses the
x64  installer  only).  It  will  lead to the mistake in the installation
process.
