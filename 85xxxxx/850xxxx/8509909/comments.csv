[V],politux,2013-05-27T19:03Z,Please don't comment on my torrents any more.  I don't know how else to make it clear to you that your input is not welcome.
[T],rjordan21,2013-05-29T22:20Z,"O God.... get a Life, please.  Or at least label your torrents correctly...."
[V],politux,2013-05-30T22:21Z,"Dude,

You know exactly what you're doing.  You like to insult other uploaders for some reason.  I don't come on your torrents talking shit, yet you come on mine and call me names.  Kind of childish, then you have the gall to act like I'm the problem.  It's pretty simple, stay off my torrents and I'll stay off yours.  

The innocent act is getting old."
[T],rjordan21,2013-06-01T01:57Z,"I have no idea why you get so bent out of shape when anyone has anything other to comment on ""your"" uploads other than showering praise... 

In any event, my comments are far from insulting but simply accurate on any torrent uploaded here. Go back and read them again, it's all about the music. Sorry if the truth wounds you in some way.  "
[V],politux,2013-06-02T20:24Z,What part of don't comment on my torrents do you not understand?
[T],rjordan21,2013-06-03T02:41Z,"^^ There hasn't been any name calling or ""shit talking"" as you say so as I've said, what part of stop being so sensitive over nothing do you not understand?  "
[V],politux,2013-06-03T03:05Z,"You got a short memory, did you or did you not call me a ""tool""?

[T],rjordan21,2013-06-03T04:10Z,"Urban dictionary definition: ""One who lacks the mental capacity to know he is being used. A fool. A cretin. Characterized by low intelligence and/or self-steem.""  geat word....

If memory serves I think I used it after your ""shit talking"" innacurate diatribe accusing me of commenting ""on every vinyl upload"" and being ""the self appointed vinyl expert"" on TPB or something like that, idk... I think you deleted the torrent, right?"
[V],politux,2013-06-03T04:48Z,"The only legitimate reason to comment on a torrent would be if you downloaded it and did or didn't like it.  

Asking ""what cartridge did you use on this vinyl rip?"" on  5 different torrents is utterly pointless.  This is a public torrent site, do you honestly think every vinyl uploaded is a personal rip?  I don't state anywhere on my uploads that they are personal rips.  I don't add my tag to the titles, in fact when there is a specific tag such as PBTHAL or Dr Robert I add that.  If there is no tag I just leave the folder as it was.

The only reason that I'm commenting here is to make a simple request, please don't comment on my torrents.  

We can go round and round in circles all day but it is kind of pointless.  I asked you not to comment on my uploads the next day you posted a link to that PBTHAL rip of Dark Side of the Moon on my Pink Floyd torrent.

You claim you don't insult people and call names, then when I cite specific instance you post an Urban Dictionary link but don't deny that you said it....

I will ask you once more: please don't comment on my torrents."
,The_Faker,2013-06-03T10:49Z,what cartridge did you use on this vinyl rip?
[T],rjordan21,2013-06-05T00:25Z,"^^^ that's funny...

@politux

There are many legitimate reasons to comment on a torrent besides praising the uploader...one of which is asking about source components used for vinyl uploads.  Believe me, I never thought for a second you actually created any of the vinyl torrents you've uploaded. Many, if not all, vinyl uploaders list equipment in the description because the source components matter greatly.... not the bit length or sampling rate.  I could upload a 24bit 192khz file of a cassette recording and it wouldn't help the sound. That's the point.

When you first uploaded what, 3 vinyl files all at the same time, I asked you if you knew what equipment was used.... not to ""spam"" you but simply because I wondered... not so terrible from my perspective.  Instead of just replying to me that you didn't know I got some ridiculous lecture (I'm well aware of what TPB is... and stands for) and then you went and had all my comments deleted.... some of which were answering legitimate questions from users on other uploads.... really?  Seems extreme.

When someone poses a question to the users here I'll answer it.  Such was the case from pebh on the DSOTM torrent.... pretty simple."
[V],politux,2013-06-05T15:49Z,"Thanks for finally admitting you have had an axe to grind this whole time.  Now that it is out in the open that you harbor a resentment against me for getting your spam comments removed I consider this matter closed.

Hope to not hear from you again."
[T],rjordan21,2013-06-06T00:31Z,"^^^ just consider answering a simple question next time.... you're definition of spam is skewed.

there's no resentment at all, it's all about the music.

I'll say it again, stop being so sensitive..."
,botoxbutox,2013-06-06T05:13Z,"Hi, could I please comment? Yes, this is a public tracker, so.... could you two crybabies stop whining? Try to kill each other w/ PM's, that works great. Thanks anyway to whoever posted this, doesn't matter if it was FIRST by the way. Take some deep breaths, look outside at the sun shining on the trees."
[T],rjordan21,2013-06-06T15:17Z,"^^^ :) 

it's all about the music...."
[V],politux,2013-06-07T20:36Z,"@rjordan21

No hard feelings on my end mate. 

Sorry for getting so carried away. 

You're right it should be about the music."
[T],rjordan21,2013-06-08T01:47Z,"^^^ cool, no worries. No hard feelings on my end either. 

Happy Listening....."
