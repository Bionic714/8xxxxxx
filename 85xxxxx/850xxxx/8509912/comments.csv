You can always use my older releases... I really don't want to make things too large to fit on a dual layer dvdr unless I have to like my superaio did..."

Now I'd like to try this new win8 evolution uploaded by typhoon or tycoon, a trusted uploader, but I would like you to give me an advice concerning the security, basically does it look clean? Thanks for everything, I love win8 and admire your job and patience. You take care. "

I had to use imagex.exe but would be nice if this was done beforehand ;)"
