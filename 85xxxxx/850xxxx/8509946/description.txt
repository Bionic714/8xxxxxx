London at the turn of the century in 1901. Three men are on a mission for the IRA to steal all the gold in the vaults of the Bank of England. Norgate, their leader, discovers the bank's weak spot: an old forgotten sewer straight under the vaults. But they have to deal with captain Fitch, a young but suspicious bank guard. 

Banks have one sane function only: To be robbed.
