,bielzibob,2013-05-26T06:21Z,sorry great one for the intrusion. i humbly apologize. u r still my hero.
,beechyboy,2013-05-26T15:13Z,How do you put a torrent on FORCED sharing?
,beechyboy,2013-05-26T15:17Z,"Is your source from 
PDTV x264-W4F ?"
[V],psspss,2013-05-26T16:01Z,"utorrents setting called initial seeding

no.. its a web rip... if I used others source I would of said so in the description liek i normally do

unless it didnt have a tag!"
[V],psspss,2013-05-26T16:02Z,also mine came out hours before that other source
,beechyboy,2013-05-26T19:18Z,"I use uTorrent 2.2.1 and I can't find ""utorrents setting called initial seeding"" anywhere. Is it only in the newer version?"
[V],psspss,2013-05-27T04:27Z,"in all versions.. the problem I find is it shows up everyone pretty much not seeding and it halts or crawls at 3kb./s to 10kb/s 
and it dont like other clients.. but it does seem to save on data in the long term. works best when got 30 connecting that way you get a group of sharers its workign with and the rest just sit idle

you find most things in utorrent with the right click.. it has lots of functions hidden in right clicks.. try it and click about.. right click on columns and rigth click on the files in the files tab your see what I mean

right click on the torrent seeding and go properties your find it there"
,beechyboy,2013-05-27T14:09Z,"Found it.
I'll give a try next time I upload.

Thanks"
[V],psspss,2013-06-01T05:16Z,"
well im out of data earlier then normal now so prob unlikely I be able to share the next 2.. if w4f is doing them perhaps leave them to it then since not many download this show anyhow or keep it seeded"
