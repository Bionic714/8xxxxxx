Sôl austan, Mâni vestan is inspired by and made for the "ForeBears" movie by Marie Cachet and Varg Vikernes, where much of the Scaldic music from "Sôl austan, Mâni vestan" appears, only in unmastered form, as a soundtrack.

Artwork presents the painting titled "Rape of Proserpina" by the Spanish painter Ulpiano Checa (1888).

Sôl austan, Mâni vestan is old Norwegian for "east of the sun, west of the moon". All the song titles are in old Norwegian. According to Varg Vikernes, this is a concept album about "a descent into darkness and the following ascend back into the light; the Pagan initiation, the elevation of man to the divine, the enlightenment of the mind, the feeding of the elven light in man".
