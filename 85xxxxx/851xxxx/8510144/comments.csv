[T],penfag,2013-05-26T16:15Z,"@micos7 - I have a so-so PDF of Girard's ""Violence and the Sacred"" (1977) if you're interested."
[T],pharmakate,2013-05-26T16:50Z,"@micos7 - I have a pdf of the Girard reader, but it's a conversion from html; readable but not great. I'll put it up soon. I also have The Scapegoat, and I should be able to post a nice version of it shortly.

@penfag - I'd really like to see your version of Violence and the Sacred."
[T],pharmakate,2013-05-26T17:35Z,"@micos7 - And this book is based on mimetic theory:
