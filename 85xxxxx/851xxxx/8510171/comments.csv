,Getabrain,2013-05-26T11:46Z,The format is wrong! What is wrong with you people? Could you share another version with the right format?? In advance thanks.
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-26T12:32Z,Get a brain. MKV is the right format.
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-26T12:34Z,It would appear you meant the aspect ratio. The screenshots do show a squashed image...
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-26T12:43Z,"The 1080p is better.
1080p: http://bayimg.com/GAMIjaAeO
720p: http://bayimg.com/GAMiKAAEO"
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-26T12:44Z,This one is definitely incorrectly cropped
,Getabrain,2013-05-26T13:36Z,Ja sorry jeg mente the aspect ratio.
