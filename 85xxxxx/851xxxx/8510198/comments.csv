But be careful for the EGTR as that one has a fake installer. Also thanks ""tornade25"" For the info on the post about the other site. 
@eshborn- Stuck on what? He just uploaded this. How could you be stuck on this for 2 days? Perhaps try adding this torrent to your DL or try to add the trackers from it. It might link up! If your talking about this torrent. The old one got deleted along with Alaska and currently Opus!"

,maddog7777,2013-05-26T22:58Z,"@mattyshigh- People are going around claiming they work for Orbx or they are developers and people are asking TPB to remove their torrents. I have been finding this happening with quite a few different companies. Supposedly they ones claiming to be such are doing this. Its people from other sites where people are getting to files from making up these fun loving threats because they are mad people are posting up here. TPB has never given a crap about copyright laws and would not remove a torrent unless you specifically asked them too. They use the scare tactic that they have your ISP and will call them. I laugh at this because so what if they have it. Call them I say, because what are you going to tell them? LMAO. That I am using the internet... A lot of people do not understand how the internet works and filing complaints. You have to have a plausible cause to report something to someones ISP and those are threats made and has nothing to do with uploading or downloading. But once people hear about this, they freak out and go into panic mode and start requesting that TPB or other places to remove their listings. However it is each individuals choice to keep it alive or remove it. I say if you remove it, then people will some place else to get it. Again it is their choice and no one is forcing them to keep their torrent up.  "
