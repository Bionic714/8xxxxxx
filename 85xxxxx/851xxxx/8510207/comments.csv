Just one tiny comment about encoding. :-)
I've done some encoding, and for the video, setting fast_pskip=0 and decimate=0 helps remove a lot of the color banding in the sky and when there's lots of smoke and stuff.

It only increases encode time by a very short time comparatively. You might want to give it a try and see if its as visible for you. :)

Thanks again for this awesome (Trilogy/Quadrilogy ?) :)"

Well, I've been contemplating if it should be a Trilogy or Quadrilogy for Die Hard (if ever) and I came to the conclusion that I'll go with the Trilogy, because I dig the first 3 movies (Die Hard 1 I really love) and the later ones are just shite that never should have been made!"
,Gacy8Gein,2013-05-27T08:18Z,"My thoughts exactly!
It should be a Trilogy :)

4 was horrible, and so was 5.
There will be a 6 (and maybe a 7) since people keep on going to watch it, and making the film money. "
[T],vonRicht,2013-05-27T15:06Z,"Isn't the new one 'A Good Day to Die Hard' number 6 btw? And yeah I just read that a number 7 is scheduled for pre production sometime in 2013. :(

I decided not to encode and upload number 6 cause I found it so bad.

So I uploaded 'Die Hard 1' instead. :)"
,Gacy8Gein,2013-05-27T20:20Z,"Just checked on Google, and the latest one is 5.
:)
Die Hard 4.0 was the first one to be rated 12 on release. Just that told me it was likely to be shite.
5 is just very bad.
1 and 3 walk all over the other, with 2 getting a special mention (It fits the series well).

Thank again anyway for all your hard work. :)"
[T],vonRicht,2013-05-28T17:45Z,"Ohh it's number 5. :D

Ok there you go, mate - I don't care that much for the later Die Hard movies."
