I was playing an earlier version of this game and became frustrated by glitches, so I searched for a newer version of it and found this one on a Russian private tracker, and now I am bringing it to TPB. Supports both English and Russian and lacks any viruses. Previous upload was broken and I can't seem to delete it, download this one instead.

======================install instructions=========================================

1. Run setup.exe in the "game" folder to install. If you don't understand the text, click the button that says "RU". It should change to say "EN" and the installer will be in English.
2. Once the game is finished installing, copy the contents of the "Update 1.11B" folder from the torrent into where you have installed the game.

You now have a working and up to date English copy of the game. If you wish to have a Russian copy, perform step 3.

3. Copy the contents of the ╨á╤â╤ü╨╕╤ä╨╕╨║╨░╤é╨╛╤Ç/v1.2a folder of the torrent into where you have installed the game, and it will switch the language from English to Russian

If you cannot speak Russian stop at step 2 and continue playing in English, the best language there is.

I don't know what the SteamResources folder does, or why the game defaults to installing in your steam directory. The Russians I got this from probably intended it to be used with some kind of hacked Steam client for some unknown reason. It is possible to launch the game with the steam overlay anyway by just adding the shortcut as a non-steam game so there's not much point in using it.
