Katie ArmigerΓÇÿs new album, ΓÇÿFall Into Me,ΓÇÖ features 14 songs that describe loveΓÇÖs highs and lows. ItΓÇÖs a rollercoaster ride that at times feels like that line from Taylor SwiftΓÇÿs ΓÇÿWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,ΓÇÖ i.e., ΓÇ£I say ΓÇÿI hate you,ΓÇÖ we break up, you call me, ΓÇÿI love you.ΓÇÖΓÇ¥ Fortunately, ArmigerΓÇÖs way with words is more debonair.

The singer helped write each track, but not all come from her personal experiences. She describes the album as the diary of her last two years, but some of the stories are borrowed from close friends. In fact, many of the highlights find the singer one step removed from the action.

ΓÇÿHeΓÇÖs Gonna ChangeΓÇÖ is a song about someone a friend dated. The song opens the album and sets the bar high for the 13 tracks that follow. Producer Chad Carlson is at his best when working with Armiger to give her polished pop sound just the slightest bit of edge.

The chorus is one fans will delight having burrowed between their ears:

ΓÇ£HeΓÇÖs gonna change / When that sun up in the sky starts pouring rain / When the stars come out in the middle of the day / And the oceans turn to dust, go on and pray,ΓÇ¥ the 21-year-old sings.

There isnΓÇÖt a moment on ΓÇÿFall Into MeΓÇÖ when Armiger tries to outthink her all too familiar emotions. She strings stories together in a pleasant way without finding it necessary to cram them with complex poetry. ΓÇ£I donΓÇÖt understand what sheΓÇÖs talking about,ΓÇ¥ said no one ever when speaking about a Katie Armiger song. ItΓÇÖs a compliment and a statement to her credibility as a mainstream country artist.

ΓÇÿPlayinΓÇÖ With FireΓÇÖ and the single, ΓÇÿBetter in a Black Dress,ΓÇÖ are two others that find an edge to separate this singer from the rest of country music. A few never get there. The intensely personal ΓÇÿMan I Thought You WereΓÇÖ is well-written, but as a vocalist, Armiger blends in like Coffee-Mate. ΓÇÿBlack and WhiteΓÇÖ finds her struggling with whether to split from a lover. ItΓÇÖs the most traditional arrangement on this record, with the banjo and steel guitar taking center stage around a flat story.

With 14 songs, there are bound to be a few dull spots on ΓÇÿFall Into Me.ΓÇÖ ThatΓÇÖs too many for an album that doesnΓÇÖt include much variance in the topics, and by the time the rollercoaster goes back up and down on ΓÇÿNot Too LateΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿSo Long,ΓÇÖ one could find themselves looking to hop off.

There are gems after the halfway point ΓÇö ΓÇÿCardboard BoxesΓÇÖ is the sneaky, clever wraparound type song that radio loves ΓÇö and many will appreciate the overwhelming sense of optimism the singer retains despite her struggles. Armiger should be proud of this effort because more than anything else, it defines her sound in the minds of fans ΓÇö and more importantly, those who didnΓÇÖt know her previously.
