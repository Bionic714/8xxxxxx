,Sullyvillain,2013-05-26T08:48Z,Thanks! I read a lot of comments and sometimes it seems like all people do is complain but I would like to just say thank you and I appreciate it and if I ever met you in real life I would buy you a beer and I know talk is cheap but please believe that you and your work is making my life a little easier and I have two stupid jobs that I work all the time and sometimes I can't be home saturday night to catch this shit and especially if it's PPV and now I have a few moments to myself with a glass of wine while everyone is asleep and so thanks. Good ngiht!

You're awesome. 

Ignore the whiners, if you can. I am sure they are barely worth notice.

Cheers bru!"

,26Mercury26,2013-05-26T16:20Z,i wish there was some way to prioritize  torrents. If someone is uploading at unlimited then they should take first priority in the queue.

,zissou80,2013-05-26T23:25Z,SecTPB - thanks for your great uploads (and edits if  you're doing them).  I'm one of the few people who appreciates you leaving the Piracy wristslap screen at the beginning before the ZUFFA logo appears.  It's like a big fuck you to the establishment.

,village1diot,2013-06-05T11:32Z,"Wow, nothing but praise in here. People always say that MMA fans on the internet are assholes(and a lot of time it's hard to argue against), but this totally disproves them.

Thanks for the up, and thanx for restoring my faith in MMA fans."
