Ah, the seventies: Hideous clothes, great music."
,Mrpell,2013-05-28T22:29Z,"For those of you like me that may have been concerned with the fact that most of virana's uploads have been MP3 and then seeing [Mp3] in brackets on the torrent description and reading flac lossless made me wonder if it really was flac loseless files or if this was a case of someone trying to be funny and convert mp3's to flac.

From downloading a few songs to try it appears to be actual cd rips even though no log files were included. 

He has used ExactAudioCopy v0.99pb3 software to rip and generate the .cue files for this torrent so it would appear it is actual cd rips but still log files would have been nice to be included as well to verify and check each track.

Finally the cover.jpg files are horrible quality. I guess even after 21 years when the JPEG standard first came out in 1992 some people still don't realize if you keep resaving a JPG file over and over and over eventually it'll be a blocky mess of pixilated shit which is what these 400x400 cover.jpg files are.  

If you're going to take the time out to rip a large cd collection like this at least use a scanner and do proper cover scans and save in a format like PNG. 

Other then the cover art issue and not including log files from EAC it's still a decent upload especially for those harder to find song's from the 70's."
