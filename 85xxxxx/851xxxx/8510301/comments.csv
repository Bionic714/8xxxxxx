,cgculpepper,2013-05-26T21:21Z,"interesting reading!

fact:
-it's common that when a fake torrent is uploaded , it is the first upload of a new uploader.

-Star Trek (2013) Into Darkness is ""universalmedia"" 's first upload

-advice:
-currently 177 peers listed ...wait and see if any of these ""listed"" peers complete download

better advice: avoid

At least your reserving ultimate judgment, but your also assuming based on 1st UL protocol to claim inappropriate activity. 
That logic doesn't really pass either.

Hey, if you don't want a great quality CAM with enhanced intro/end credits (which are troubled in most cams) then move it along. 

If your interested, please DL - this version of the movie is fine and will last until ultimate release for me. 

My universalmedia username is a bit intimidating I suppose bc it resembles hollywood, but really, the name was inspired 1) available, and 2) suits the philosophy of torrent based access principles which I surely believe.

Lastly, I rarely go to the theater, last time I went was to follow first couple of series in the SAW movies during Halloween time of the year. 

It takes a lot to go to a movie, and a lot to put forth the CAM effort and an additional amount of effort ot post produce and prep for torrent access.

,universalmedia,2013-05-27T15:54Z,"I suppose a sample file could have been included for ""verification purposes"" but I just wasn't thinking about that at the time. 

If I could append one to this torrent, let me know how.

I may include one in an alternate torrent and link it to this torrent.

Additionally, yes, go ahead and review user account history and click on those names above/below to look at their UL history to explore their integrity.

,thcfreak666,2013-05-29T00:50Z,Now its green and enough Seeders. I will give it a try. 
,thcfreak666,2013-05-29T00:55Z,"Download is now in progress, maybe its my fail and the files on Usenet cames from another guy. I will report my status and Quality after fimsching the Download."

seems to be legitimate!

to universalmedia
-not tyring to give hard time but if you watch the phony uploads with their evermore convincing  (deceptive) descriptions , you would also be leery.
-once you have more uploads behind you , surely there will be less flack.
