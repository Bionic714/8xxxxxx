The most politically incorrect show on Aussie TV but very funny and typical of many housing commission dead beats.


Housos is the not so epic, stories of Shazza, Dazza, Franky and Kylie - four best mates from down on the block. Sure, they drink away their problems, they might even have frequent domestics but down on the block it's all for one and one for all. 
Housos follows the adventures of the residents of the Sunnyvale Housing Commission in ΓÇÿevery-townΓÇÖ Australia. They battle cops and they scam Centrelink, they even have the occasional threesome and swingers party, but once youΓÇÖre down with the crew in the hood it's "Sunnyvale for life".
Fact of life; Australia is getting dumber, less educated - and at the bottom of the barrel you'll find the fully sick adventures of the residents from Sunnyvale... What does it mean to be a houso? It means that life is far from easy. What do you do if ambulances won't come into your area because kids throw rocks at them? Hmmm, maybe you should steal a fire truck and get to the hospital that way? What do you do if your dad owes thousands to the bikies and your boyfriend needs bail money? Maybe importing shifty boogie boards could solve all your problems. ItΓÇÖs funny how much work they put into actually avoiding real work. 
From the creator of ΓÇÿFat PizzaΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿSwift and Shift CouriersΓÇÖ, Pauly Fenech, the assassin of political correctness, does to bogans what Kath and Kim did to lower, middle class Australia. Housos is a fashion statement from AustraliaΓÇÖs dodgiest suburbs; thongs, hoodies and Ugg boots will transport you to a world where self-medicating, poorly educated stooges are not only the norm theyΓÇÖre a fact of life. They may be trashy but they are literally as thick as thieves. With the best of the ΓÇÿFat PizzaΓÇÖ and ΓÇÿSwift and Shift CouriersΓÇÖ ensemble ΓÇÿHousosΓÇÖ brings the real face of AustraliaΓÇÖs suburban underbelly to life.
