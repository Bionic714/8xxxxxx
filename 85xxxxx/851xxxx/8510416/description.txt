Hey guys, I found it really hard to find this album since the download got removed from waitwhatmusic.com so I found the individual songs and pieced it together in an album because I thought some people here might appreciate it. I use TPB heaps so I figured it was time to give back. I hope this all works, I've never uploaded anything before so there's a good chance this might not even work lol. I had to Google how to do everything. So please let me know if anyone successfully downloads this. :) 
It's a great album guys, I seriously recommend this album. If you haven't heard it before give it a try! You won't regret it. If you love Biggie like I do give this fresh new take on his songs a go and you might like it. 

Cheers guys!
