Any chance you have Michael Harvey's The Innocence Game, I love this author though
this book may not make it to the bestselling list.
Thanks again."

I only found this by searching for 'nonfiction'. It would be great if you could add some useful tags or upload in a way that allows the contents to be searchable."
