Wifey's World, founded in late January 1998. About a married couple known to their Internet fans as Hubby and Wifey. The couple are high school sweethearts and married circa 1986.

The business started when "Hubby" posted some polaroids of "Wifey" on the Usenet newsgroup alt.binaries.pictures.erotica in 1997 with her eyes hidden. Surprised by the favorable response, the couple continued to post steadily more explicit images. By fall of 1997, they were doing "brisk" mail-order business of their home videos. In the fall of 1998, they launched the website.

This site rip is from 5/25/2013 back to 1/1/2003.  

Included is HD video, classics, and spotlight videos from other amateurs.

I have organized the videos by year.

This is a massive collection and will need lots of seeders. 

And as always....

Enjoy
