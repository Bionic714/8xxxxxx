,fake_clubsoda,2013-05-29T06:47Z,"Now that surprises me. What version of OSX are you using (10.4, 10.5, 10.6 etc.) and is it a PPC or an Intel Mac?"
,fake_clubsoda,2013-05-29T06:56Z,"It must work for most people though, as I have seen growth in the number of seeders since three days ago when I uploaded the torrent.

Those of you who downloaded the game and it worked, please be so kind and leave feedback. Thank you ever so much"
,LuJr,2013-05-29T19:09Z,MBA OSX 1.8GHz Intel Core i5
,LuJr,2013-05-29T19:14Z,Lion 10.8.3
,fake_clubsoda,2013-05-29T19:46Z,"Thank you for the specs LuJr. Unfortunately, I won't be able to help you. I asked for these simply to let others know that there's a possibility the game won't work on a similar laptop as yours. I feel your pain knowing how hard it is to find scrabble for mac... or any decent game for that matter. 

Should anyone else have problems running the game, please let us know. I know for fact it works and always has on my 2007 white macbook 10.6.8 and that when I copied the .app file (the .app file was all I originally got, there was no .dmg, so nothing is missing) onto a friend's laptop - one of the new unibody macbook pros running osx lion - it worked flawlessly, we played a full game and all was great. Well people, do leave feedback."
,fake_clubsoda,2013-05-29T19:55Z,"oh, and one more thing LuJr - 10.8.3 isn't lion, it's SNOW LION. i hope that snow lion isn't the end of the line for this game... 

like i said before though, it works up to lion i.e. 10.7.x, at least in my experience."
,fake_clubsoda,2013-05-29T21:29Z,snow lion lol. i meant mountain lion. alright whatever.
,LuJr,2013-06-01T01:15Z,"Alrighty, thank you."
,NakedTeddyBear,2013-06-01T12:34Z,"10.8 is when they brought in Gatekeeper, which may be what's causing the problem. You may be able to get it to run by going to System Preferences->Security & Privacy->Allow applications downloaded from->Anywhere.

Note that this will increase your chances of Malware etc, so you might want to change it before playing and then revert it after."
,bjornagainswede,2013-06-03T20:35Z,"I have this game (Not from this torrent though)... and have had it for years... since 2007 al least,,, Works perfectly on Snow Cat and I am pretty sure I tested it also with the Mountain Cat and it worked fine there also!!!!

May be an issue with this particular torrent..."
,fake_clubsoda,2013-06-04T20:57Z,"bjornagainswede, thank you for confirming that this game works on a variety of ""cats"". but you can't assume that there ""May be an issue with this particular torrent"" if you havent actually tested the torrent...

im sure that the torrent is fine and will work for those it is supposed to work for (the right hardware configuration, osx version etc). 

those of you who run 10.8 or higher may try what NakedTeddyBear suggested above.

good luck."
,ClubQBall,2013-06-06T14:20Z,Definitely works on my oldest Mac - a PPC G5 running 10.5.8 Leopard.  
,fake_clubsoda,2013-06-06T14:45Z,"Sweet, we have then established that it's a universal binary. Thanks so much ClubQBall"
