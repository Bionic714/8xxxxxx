Scrabble v. 1.0.1.4 by GameHouse Inc. 2006 *ENGLISH*


A splendid version of Scrabble for Macs with Intel processors (that's what Activity Monitor says anyways - INTEL. If you're on a PPC Mac you can still give it a try). 

You can't buy in on the Mac App Store even if you wanted to. I believe I originally got it from the now defunct Demonoid.

It does not require you to keep the .dmg file, in fact there isn't a .dmg file - just unzip the archive and drag the .app file into your Applications folder!

The game has two modes, a built-in Merriam Webster spellcheck dictionary and a bunch of other cool features. You can play against another human or CPU of selectable wit.

Tested and working on OSX LION but I'm pretty sure it will keep rocking on Mountain Lion and subsequent releases as they appear. If it doesn't - please leave a comment.

Hope you guys have as much fun playing the game as I do!


Thank you for seeding,
