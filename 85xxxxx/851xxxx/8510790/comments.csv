,RenegadeDeer,2013-05-26T17:06Z,I don't know what largeOwl is trying to pull. It's legit.
,Ixshil,2013-05-26T17:11Z,Who the hell pays by data anymore? is this 1992? death2dipshits should have a real hard think about his own handle and his life choices.

??????????????"
,large0wl,2013-05-26T17:25Z,COOL ETA 6WEEKS TILL DL IS FINISHED
,dmitrriy,2013-05-26T17:33Z,"I've only downloaded 8% so far and I opened what has been downloaded in the video player. It showed the still of the Bluth staircar with text ""Netflix original series"" and two or three seconds of Kristen Wiig and Seth Rogen talking funny, so by far I think the download is legit. Can't tell about virus-free or not, of course, due to obvious reasons."
,piratebuddha,2013-05-26T17:42Z,"DibyaTPB is a legit and longtime trusted uploader. 

Pay no attention to ""Death2Dipshits"" who is just another one of these fucking countless leeches who never uploaded anything while complaining that it takes too long to download.

Thank you @DibyaTPB, you never disappoint. "
,trace535,2013-05-26T17:42Z,"@large0wl

What you experienced is probably something called a memory pointer fault, because the file was not done downloading and hence was corrupt, VLC started playing another recent file that had been in memory before."
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T17:53Z,"Most people pay for bandwidth genius, unlimited just came back to the states -_-"
,Enemencio,2013-05-26T18:04Z,"Don't know what some people are talking about.  DibyaTPB doesn't upload fake torrents.  He always uploads legit, high-quality stuff."
,pigwiggle,2013-05-26T18:17Z,"It's legit -- exactly what t says it is. The sound's good. The picture's sort of iffy on a big screen, but it's perfectly watchable."
,Jesus_Christ,2013-05-26T18:31Z,"Look at the ""Better than Craigslist"" photos in the ad to the left.  WTF?  Are fat cows how you generate traffic and revenue?  Again, WTF?  You've got to be kidding.  Who could fantasize about these heffers."
,ntsrtrq,2013-05-26T18:55Z,"Thanks DibyaTPB. Been looking forward to these a long time.

To NightOwl: you are seeing old stuff on your hd, like trace535 said.

I don't understand people who want to sacrifice quality to save hd space. Even if you watch 1080p movies every hour of every day and never sleep and never delete anything, it would still just cost 1000 dollars per year."
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T19:06Z,"Most people in the world pay for their bandwidth, has nothing to do with saving HD space, and there is no real reason to need this or most anything on here in HD -_-"
,dmitrriy,2013-05-26T19:09Z,"to ntsrtrq: $1000 is some people's yearly income, and I'm not overexaggerating. And unlimited Internet data is still luxury in many places of the world, I wouldn't say majority, but still. For people who are (correctly) complaining about the big size: I can only advise you to wait until some other sceners will upload lower quality versions, or simple users converting the videofiles into other formats.
To the uploader: I have really never even imagined that in less than 24 hours after the release 1080P versions will be available, so for that I thank you enourmosly. Keep up the good work."
,killbush,2013-05-26T19:23Z,"Awesome, thanks!"
,menano,2013-05-26T19:52Z,"I too never thought a rip of such amazing quality would arrive this early, thank you so much! Now we just need it fasterrrr"
,dmitrriy,2013-05-26T20:12Z,"I finally downloaded all 100% of the torrent, and it has a lot missing, I tried watching it on another laptop and experienced the same problem. I'll try to redownload it from a more constantly machine and write here about the results."
,PurityDeath,2013-05-26T20:20Z,"Jesus_Christ at 2013-05-26 18:31 CET:

,Copyleft2P2MAGE,2013-05-26T20:30Z,COULD YOU PLS UPLOAD A 
,dmitrriy,2013-05-26T20:37Z,"Never mind my last comment, turns out I didn't download the whole torrent. Anyway I'll try my luck with the 720p rip."
,dmitrriy,2013-05-26T20:43Z,"Never mind my last comment, turns out I didn't download it completely. I'll try my luck witht he 720p rip now."
,angelpunem,2013-05-26T21:17Z,"Thanks Dibya, you never disappoint. Always the best quality (I love 1080p) and the fastest uploader. 
please you lucky seeders with UNLIMITED bandwidth keep on seeding and increase your upload speed, much appreciated. :)"
,555light,2013-05-26T22:47Z,The Quality is not Good v5
,shabbamanuk,2013-05-27T01:47Z,"thanx dibya,but jeez,this is sloooooow."
,sween64,2013-05-27T01:55Z,"A=10 for 2 channel audio
V = 7, most of the time it's 10 but the start is poor quality while it buffers and there's a video capture watermark briefly in parts"
,mushitushi,2013-05-27T01:58Z,"Hey guys, does this release have subtitles?"
,thankyoutoall,2013-05-27T02:31Z,"I was thinking the same thing. If you pay for data, you made bad choices in life, lol.  you have bigger problems then this show, haha.    Let me ask. Is it the country, (like the government of these countries, that doesnt let these guys have stuff, or they just have no money, so no companies invest in infrastructure. Because if you can pay, people get unlimited data.  Im curious, WHY DO YOU PAY FOR ""PER DATA""  Why? Why REALLY?"
,idk420,2013-05-27T02:48Z,maybe you should research other country's internet policies. 
[V],meech,2013-05-27T08:56Z,"There's a watermark for the program that was used to rip the streaming video.  Granted it only comes up from time to time...but it's more than once.  It's on more than one of the episodes...perhaps on all of them, don't know yet.  Watermark says it's a trial version.  Funny that the ripper/encoder didn't crack the program before posting it on THEPIRATEBAY...kind of ironic if you think about it.

I don't blame dibyatpb...he is an awesome uploader.  And these are still the best quality (still disappointed about no surround sound though) on here.  Will continue to download rest of the season."
,kulapik,2013-05-27T13:08Z,@meech LOL www.buzzfeed.com/hunterschwarz/there-a-showstealer-pro-trial-version-watermark-all-over-arr?s=mobile
,Ixshil,2013-05-27T16:44Z,"Meech, AD was put out with this watermark on it to fool people like you; watch it on netflix it will have the watermark."
,Ixshil,2013-05-27T16:46Z,death it did? funny I've had it for years and years and years.
[V],meech,2013-05-27T19:30Z,"yes i was fooled.  How was I supposed to know.  What a funny joke...not really.  Downloading off piratebay, i can handle things like this from time to time (ala screeners)...but if i paid for netflix streaming, i wouldn't be too thrilled at the joke.  It's kind of more annoying than funny, if you ask me."
,VigilanceS,2013-05-28T13:15Z,"Look at the people who don't understand the ""Showstealer Pro Trial Version"" joke. 

I hope you people don't actually call yourselves AD fans..."
[V],meech,2013-05-30T00:13Z,"Understand and appreciate are two different things.  And yes, I call myself an ""AD"" fan...so your hopes are crushed.  I love Arrested Development and yes I ""get"" the humor.

But this joke...flash it up once or twice...classic Arrested Development humor...i get it (now that I know it was intentional...if you say that you got the joke before reading about it online, i say I don't believe you).

Saying the same joke over and over through multiple episodes...it's just not AD style if you ask me.  The joke just gets old quick.  AD is all about intelligent, quick and wit.  If you're still laughing the 10th time you see this, I hope you don't call yourself an AD fan."
,activoice,2013-05-30T01:13Z,"Just some tips on how to convert this to an MKV for  those inclined.

I couldn't get Ripbot264 to accept these files as is without complaining about the audio... (you might have better luck with Handbrake)

Used TSMuxer to Demux the audio and video into separate files.

Deleted the original .ts files

Used XVID4PSP to convert the aac audio to AC3 audio. (you could use another tool that converts AAC to AC3)

Deleted the aac files

Loaded the Video file, and the AC3 audio file into Ripbot264, and encoded to MKV."
,kevduch,2013-05-30T13:10Z,Another awesome torrent from Dibya. I go to his uploads first everyday to get my HD shows. = )
,christo7,2013-05-30T20:17Z,"Anyone who thought ""Showstealer Pro"" was a real thing is too stupid to live."
,squash34,2013-06-02T08:46Z,"""can i get lower quality so i can play on my xbox""

xbox fanboi: check
lack of appreciation of awesome 1080p quality: check
failure to use a computer to watch media: check
failure to have reasonable storage capacity: check

fuck it i'm not going down the list. you are a proven retard."
