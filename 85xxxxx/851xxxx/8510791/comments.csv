[V],globeplus,2013-05-26T22:51Z,"Hi jkg55 and everyone out there that this file can possible interest and besides correct no problem on the work in videos and audio , at least looks like that i needed some guts as i did it before in other action-rpg game files with decisions in graphics quality based on the truly point , not a scheme to get a rip of the highest graphics quality only a few video cards can support with extra functions that are not really necessary to play and my tests on the gameplay was if the playing suffer any problem with this decision and the answer is that what i played looked normal independtly of the decision but i don´t know if that will be true in all the game besides that have a chance for that , i did it and please have this in mind , what my ripper conscience about the search for the best size possible keeping the gameplay no matter what tells me to do , i recognise that i got a little percentage of risk to have to repair something even if that means a possible extra file but maybe don´t happen and my analysis in what was possible to do on this game rip was done , it is true that this little doubts makes me praying for everything be fine but making real rips it is to make decisions and that it is also true , this a rare case of doubts that i get with the work on the rip maybe because is an action-rpg game not so common that the graphics quality files are heavy worked from the game developers , it is true that in 99%  i don´t get any doubts about the work and i leave 1% for certain special cases that the ripper can get some possible risk on the decision but that it is ripper life , of course i don´t have the right to upload rips that can cause problems to the users but believe please that i followed my conscience about the possibilitys even if that is correct or not in this particular case ... i will wait for replys or not about the gameplay and i really played about an half hour without any problem but many work in many things didn´t gived me the time to play more and make a more complete test , one thing is for shore the game start fine on the menus , have 7 languages available for menus and subtitles and the videos works with normality after the work done no doubt , please read the MUSTREAD.txt included on the file before start to play ... thank you for understand this line of work on this particular game and see you all around here at piratebay ..."

[V],globeplus,2013-05-27T14:06Z,"To KOLAVERI : it is 1.0.0.1 and no need to update as i know , my talk was about my work on this rip file that have some risk percentage in everything be ok with the gameplay all thje game but if that happens it is my fault and if it is really necessary that i hope not the update file or something it will be making independtly of the size , well maybe is ok maybe not but for the moment is file going that´s all ... see all of you around ..."
[V],globeplus,2013-05-27T14:19Z,"This comment is to make a real request to the users of this file : please keep the LOW graphics quality duringthe gameplay , that will not affect the game and the difference to better graphics quality is not that much , nothing that is really make the difference if you understand what i mean , so if the gameplay is ok keeping the low quality graphics then we have a successfull well concepted rip for this game , for example i played all gta4 in low graphics settings and the mobility of the carachter and the  ram available improved a lot , i played also for a while with higher graphics quality and i can guarantee that i didn´t noticed nothing special besides the fact that the carachter was more slow moving around the screen , the framerate dropped with that and this is true , so i make a bet on this rip for low graphics standard to play the game and maybe it is ok but even if keeping the low graphics quality any real problems happen , i am here anyway to analise a possible update or another file no matter it will be the size , thank you again for understand my way of work for this particular game but making rips sometimes can be taking risks too , see you all around here and happy game to all of you ..."
