,binderguy1,2013-05-26T15:08Z,"A most impressive compilation, Ahlat!  I wouldn't worry too much about a typo.  ;-)

Thanks for the ul."
,aft_849,2013-05-26T17:14Z,"Thanks man! Just what i needed.

farewell Johns. Its been a good ride."
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-26T18:02Z,"...You know, say what you want about Johns and the whole DCNu52cardpickup nightmare, but his GL run has been one worth the effort making a special collection of and posting. That idiot Ron Marz won't ever get that kind of special treatment over the years he ruined the entire GL franchise, even if all those bonus checks he brags about turn out to be real. And even then they'll only wind up being welfare checks with a DC Comics sticker pasted over the government seal!

Too bad Waid can't write as good as Johns. Then people would still be demanding his return to The Flash :)"
,BatDingler,2013-05-26T18:55Z,"awesome collection, thanks. I was about to go find it all myself individually, so good job"

,TheScribe56,2013-05-27T06:10Z,"Ya know, this has been stuck at 19.7% all day.  I see one seed listed here and 67 in uTorrent, but it's clearly stuck.  "
,Ahlat,2013-05-27T06:53Z,I apologize. My upload speed is slow (upto 60 kb/s) and Last night it was only able to be uploaded for 8-9 hours. I've turned the laptop back on and am now continuing to upload it.
,Adjunct,2013-05-27T10:22Z,Many thanks. Fantastic up. Will seed forever.
,TheScribe56,2013-05-28T03:22Z,"Oh well, no prob.  Eventually you'll have dozens of us seeding it.  What I don't understand is why uTorrent says there are 87 seeds, when it's obvious that's not true, I've seen this before and have never been able to figure out why?  

But thanks for the UL, I can't wait to start reading.  "
,new52,2013-05-31T02:31Z,Thanks Ahlat!
,Shane35007,2013-06-02T15:43Z,"This is awesome thank you. Blackest Night was what brought me into comics.

Is there something wrong with my reader settings? All the two page panels are out of order in the back of the book."
,tchaiko,2013-06-02T17:23Z,I'm having the same problem with the two-pagers all being collected at the end of the issue. Using CDisplayEx to read them. 
,Ahlat,2013-06-04T12:32Z,"I'm using Comic Rack and they're working fine there. Though when opened with rar they are collected at the bottom of the file, so it may have something to do with that. Sorry about that, didn't realise t would cause problems."
,jon2d2,2013-06-05T19:35Z,"Ahlat, lol that typo struck me too! I found this before and made a note to find it again. It just took me a while to find because of that pesky typo.

It does nothing to affect just how awesome the pack is though. I'm completely indebted to you sir. "
,jon2d2,2013-06-05T19:36Z,"Cheap plug.
