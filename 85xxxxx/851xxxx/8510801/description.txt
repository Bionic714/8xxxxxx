I must give credit to CorpusM who's torrent I had downloaded. Everything before the New 52 was compiled and ordered by him. I merely removed the non green lantern related titles from Blackest Night and Brightest Day. I also deleted extra pages not related to the story, such as ads and DC Nation. Everything from the New 52 is compiled and ordered by me. Again I deleted the extra pages in those issues as well.

Credit goes to the original scanners, who scanned these comics and provided them for us.
