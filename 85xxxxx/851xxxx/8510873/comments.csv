,tmiracle,2013-05-26T16:55Z,agreed... i WANT to download it.. but i waited this long.. i guess i should wait for a more secure download. :(
,thechilling,2013-05-26T17:02Z,im downloading 1 episode from this n checking it out. il let u guys know if u can play this with vlc
,thechilling,2013-05-26T17:05Z,no1 is seeding
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T17:12Z,Any of the 72 maybe morons who downloaded this wanna let us know how legit this is
,tmiracle,2013-05-26T17:21Z,^^^^^
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T17:24Z,"This will not play with VLC. This is legit, just not sure how to make it play with other players. Sorry guys!"
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T17:28Z,"@deliciouspancakes I do not know how to convert the files to AVI or MP4. I would have if I knew how. These are the files ripped from Netflix, I did not create them this way."
,thechilling,2013-05-26T17:34Z,why the fuck is nobody seeding??? and why the fuck is nobody commenting??? a/v people??
,alolpie,2013-05-26T17:39Z,If this turns out to be fake…I will outrage silently
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T18:00Z,"This is a stream grab from Netflix. Does anyone know a player or a way to convert a file that uses an encryption key? You can download the .aac file to verify the audio is in fact Season 4. I only know how to play this by using the Universal Video Downloader app in Cydia for jailbroken iOS devices. I read online it is possible to convert it, but I cannot find a way to do so. I need someone who is smarter than I am with this to help out. 

Also, these episodes are ~150MB and I am not sure that is actually HD. It is, however, the best quality the iOS Netflix app allows. Sorry if this is a crappy torrent, I wanted to share this with everyone because it is really a great series and I am almost done watching Season 4!!"
,thechilling,2013-05-26T18:05Z,why upload something which cant be played on vlc... anyway thanks for mentioning it... saved me the download
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T18:27Z,"@timster123 they are shareable, just not a normal mp4, avi, etc. format. They are playable if you use the instructions I provide in the description (my instructions let you play it from Universal Video Downloader)."
,altuses,2013-05-26T18:57Z,This is the dumbest torrent file and uploader I have ever seen. Take this disgrace of a download off the site please.

,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T19:02Z,Just delete this 
,sexiicookies,2013-05-26T19:42Z,"wow you guys are terrible. the uploader only wanted to help us out and give us access to this wonderful show. he already said in the description that you needed universal video downloader on your ios device to watch this. if this torrent has no use for you then don't download it and move on, you ungrateful internet people."
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T19:46Z,"fine, i will delete it. ungrateful twats"
,paradoxlogos,2013-05-26T19:56Z,"Some of you guys aren't so smart are you? He clearly says the only way he knows to get it to works is on a cracked ios. If you are saying to delete because the files don't work on your computer you're an idiot. If you are saying it didn't even work on your cracked ios, then say that. Gotta love the people who hate on files because they can't bother to read past the title, it's like amazon reviews on a product where you comment on the quality of a specific seller in an items entry."
,paradoxlogos,2013-05-26T19:57Z,"No, don't delete it, fuck the haters. If some jackasses can't read your description fuck em. The same thing happens on every ipod game torrent ""WHY WONT WORK THROUGH ITUNES? HERPA DERP"" Don't let the idiots scare ya off, the rest of us appreciate it"
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T19:58Z,"ugh, it wont delete for me. can someone get a mod to delete this torrent?"
,paradoxlogos,2013-05-26T20:00Z,"Said it twice, no idea why it isn't appearing, but don't delete the file because people can't read instructions. They do this on every iso and hacked ipod game file. "
,PurityDeath,2013-05-26T20:18Z,I appreciate him trying at least. Maybe some people will get a use out of it. -Shrug- It's not like he was dishonest or anything.
,idk420,2013-05-26T20:25Z,"dont call others name because you cant upload for shit. Everyone here has a legit beef. 


""1. Install Universal Video Downloader on your jailbroken iOS device.""

So i need an iDevice to play it? Then this is in the WRONG SECTION. This should be in ""Videos (Handheld)"" 

you can either move your torrent or delete it. if you can't play it on a pc or mac, then it doesn't belong in this section, 

:)"
,PurityDeath,2013-05-26T20:27Z,The HD versions someone else upped are also .ts files... ~_~
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T20:30Z,"He wasn't dishonest but it's still a useless torrent, who the fuck is going to watch this on an ipod -_-"
,idk420,2013-05-26T20:34Z,"mods are funny, still in wrong section though"
,RenegadeDeer,2013-05-26T20:39Z,"Not only did the guy upload this quickly, he's pretty clear in this directions AND he's online and responding to people's questions.

This happens all the time on tons of video game emulator stuff. ""I have your God of War download. How do I put in Xbox??? Can I put in 3DS instead?""
"
,RenegadeDeer,2013-05-26T20:43Z,"@idk420

Yeah, he put it in the wrong section. But what have you uploaded? Pissy comments don't count.

I'll end this on a smiley face, so it's apparently not douchey anymore.

,ramenxxx,2013-05-26T20:50Z,"Is there no one who knows how to rip these episodes into a normal format that isn't nearly 2 gigs per half hour episode? wtf man
"
,h.clarity,2013-05-26T20:58Z,"If anyone is running os X and has downloaded this a potential way to view these files is to host them on an apache server (http://osxdaily.com/2012/09/02/start-apache-web-server-mac-os-x/) and then view them in Quicktime or VLC

If anyone tries it and it works let us know"
,altuses,2013-05-26T20:59Z,Who wants to loan me an iPod so I can use this torrent lmao
,ryryryry,2013-05-26T21:24Z,"i know this torrent isn't the greatest. I had this uploaded within hours of the Netflix premiere. I searched and there were NO other season 4 torrents and that is why I tried to help.

I do not know of a way to play this on another device, but I know it is possible. I am not trying to trick anyone into downloading. Geez, I just wanted to share what I could. "
,Tintin714,2013-05-26T22:14Z,"Cut this guy some slack, he was only trying to help. I appreciate the effort, ryryryry."
,oker1,2013-05-26T22:19Z,"https://gist.github.com/refractalize/1561849

this script could be used, but it has to be modified to use the chunks in the m3u since this is a single file created from the encrypted chunks"
,CScott619,2013-05-27T00:11Z,Thank for the effort. screw the haters. 
,PurityDeath,2013-05-27T00:17Z,All the .aac's are each episode's entire audio file in good quality. Someone may be able to do a screen cap on the video itself and merge with the .aac audio to make a good file.
,idk420,2013-05-27T02:52Z,"@RenegadeDeer Robert Ebert doesn't direct movies, does that mean he can't criticize directors? 

Oh, btw who said this was my upload account? Fucking dipshitz. "
,ItsASpork,2013-05-27T03:34Z,Reminder that you can get a trial Netflix for free for a month if you really want to watch this now.
,mark_h,2013-05-27T03:58Z,"AFAIK this is the only torrent that has supplied all the episodes. Sure the uploader couldn't convert the files to a more common format, but they've taken the time to get the data. Instead of bitching about it being in a format you don't like, why don't you take the time to convert it then upload it for us?"
,6516753,2013-05-27T04:21Z,Don't assume that the uploader knows what he's talking about. A quick google search indicates that .ts files can be opened using VLC media player.
,dualwieldkatana,2013-05-27T04:38Z,LMAO @Death2Dipshits 
,6516753,2013-05-27T04:55Z,"Update: Right now I am able to open some of the .ts files using vlc media player, but changing the file extension and double clicking in explorer will not open the files. It's also worth noting that the TS files that I can open at the moment don't work very well. If there aren't better uploads in the morning, I will do further tests to find a solution."
,RenegadeDeer,2013-05-27T06:16Z,"@idk420

Fair enough, but the uploader doesn't need to you to play Roger Ebert and criticize the stuff he put online in the first day the show came out. This is not his job; this is something he put up on his own time to help us watch the show.

ryryryry, thanks for the upload."
,myk68,2013-05-27T07:23Z,"Works fine in VLC, thanks ryryryry.  Ignore the moaners that you apparently failed for their inability to get it themselves.  "
,hrector,2013-05-27T08:33Z,"@myk68 

Works fine on VLC?, and you don't even share how you made it possibly to play on VLC when everyone is looking for solution to play on PC"
,bucsboy,2013-05-27T09:25Z,"@hrector

You can play them on a MAC using vlc, quicktime X or safari, simply open whichever episode's index.m3u8 file in a webserver or otherwise. I don't have a mac so I don't know this for sure but I can assure you that it definitely doesn't work with any of the windows equivalents (safari for windows, vlc for windows, quicktime for windows or itunes for windows). As for iOS, you can also host the files on a webserver and point safari to index.m3u8 and it will work.

In my testing of episodes 6-15, episodes 6, 9, 12 and 13 don't work on iOS whether you stream them over http or use universal video downloader. Universal video downloader will load play the audio and not the video while safari seems to load the audio file but can't play it (testing on ios5).

Since I've spent way too much time doing research, let me sum up. These files use http live streaming (hls) from Apple with aes-128 encryption on the ts files. I have found one ruby decrypt script and one perl decrypt script, neither of which I was able to get working.

There seems to be an hls player written in python but I didn't bother trying to get that to work."
,viciousm,2013-05-27T17:06Z,"it actually does work - the directions from the maker of the Universal Video Downloader specifies the wrong directory - that directory is in that wrong location but it doesn't really work

I found another directory in another location - I put the files there and they work - don't panic

/Media/Universal_Video_Downloader/

I got into my iPod Touch 4th Gen via AppleTalk (NetAtalk)
and I recommend mounting Home and not Root
because the Home side has all the space"
,viciousm,2013-05-27T17:20Z,"somehow it won't AirPlay but it WILL play via the HDMI connector
