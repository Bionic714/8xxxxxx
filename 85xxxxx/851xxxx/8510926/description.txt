The story of a 1966 railway community told through the eyes of Tinus, an eleven-year-old boy.

Timus and his family are trapped within the structural violence caused by the government and the church at the time. An unlikely hero, Joon, often appears to save Timus, which Timus views as miracles. Timus tells the story of his own coming of age, his loss of innocence and how Joon tries to get a little of that innocence back. Nobody shares Timus's point of view, but Joon however goes on to do a little more saving in the community.

The film combines the magical world of childhood with the stark reality in which we live.
