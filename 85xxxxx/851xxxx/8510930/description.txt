A has-been with his one-hit song almost 20 years behind him, Price Geoffrey dreams of creating a second opportunity. His wife is often busy and traveling with her doctoral research into bio-chemistry. So they move back to the Washington, DC, area, where Price cleans-up his health and gets together with two younger musicians, Punk Rock Randy and Barefoot Runner. The three of them golf and record music until something happens. Perhaps something Price Geoffrey has almost forgotten will be critical in helping with the national crisis and with their sudden musical fame.    


Ultimately, this book is a sort of fan-fiction that explores the period before Marco Polo: A Play About LRH and COS. It can be read out of sequence.
