Ladyboys: Series 2
Following the success of the debut series, five new episodes offer further insight into a sector of Thai society that makes up one per cent of the country's population.
Coming up in series two, we meet the former university lecturer who moved to Bangkok three years ago to be with his transgender girlfriend. Now, the couple are moving up in the world, leaving sceptics behind to set up home in a swanky apartment. However, there is still one important person to convince - the ex-teacher's son - who travels to Asia to meet his father's partner for the first time. Also this series, we take our seats at the famous Miss International Queen Beauty pageant. Over a week, 21 contestants from 15 different nations compete to be crowned the world's most beautiful ladyboy, and there's the chance to catch up with some of the couples we met in series one.
