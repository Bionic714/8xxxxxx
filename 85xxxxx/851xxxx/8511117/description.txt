I have seen a LOT of crappy installs for this program.  This version includes the following:

--No need for a registration key
--No ad-ware, viruses, spyware n'stuff  (YAY!!!)
--Full version


I did a quick scan with Avast, it said it was clean.

I DO NOT OWN THIS PROGRAM, CLICKTEAM DOES!


If you have a complaint or a request comment on this!
