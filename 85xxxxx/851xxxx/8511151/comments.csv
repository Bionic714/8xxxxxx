,PearlRR09,2013-05-26T18:26Z,"Footy, why is that all you guys upload SKY all weekend and then BBC for the race or vice versa!?!? Makes absolutely so sense.... BBC coverage is absolute garbage too!! Eddie is a jackass, utterly! David worries more about looking at women and how tight his pants are than the racing and I've personally met 8 year olds that know more about racing and F1 than Ben..... "
,str8885,2013-05-26T18:45Z,"Thanks a million footy.

Quick question, any chance of you uploading the SKY coverage?

Thanks and Take Care"
,accuslut,2013-05-26T19:05Z,"shut up Pearl, if you want the SKY coverage, just wait a few days, and the 50 fps version will be up from our man footy here."
,odmines,2013-05-26T19:33Z,Footy are you going upload Sky race?
,JDM_GUY,2013-05-26T20:15Z,Thanks man... Come on guys seed......
,adupre,2013-05-26T20:35Z,"ya man, appreciate the fast uploads... but SKY is proffered... solely for reasons of consistency and continuity... but TBH, the coverage is def way more informed that BBC... im sure it comes down to budget and staffing."
,SerSpec-V,2013-05-26T21:11Z,Get SKY here in SD and HD. Both are better quality than this low bitrate xvids.->http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8511955/F1.20130525.Monaco.Race.SD.mp4
,pxpierre,2013-05-26T21:34Z,"Guys who want Sky fuzzoff and go elsewhere.

Thank you footy & seeders!"

,tpbpost,2013-05-27T01:51Z,"@pearl:

fuk footy, search for 'f1' instead and get smcgill1969's HD Sky release"
,ftpv014,2013-05-27T06:35Z,"thx again footy

for anyone who cares, no pre-race (unsure about post-race at this point)

I used to only want BBC but now I actually prefer SKY (much as I love seeing EJ)"
