,extracube,2013-05-28T04:28Z,"I read that Windows Thin does not allow installation or use of Office, is this completely true?  How about the older Office like 2003?  Could I at least install Microsoft Word?

Also Windows Thin is designed to use less resources.  Would one say that it uses even less system resources than a normal installation of Windows XP, or still uses more?  I have an old netbook, slow as heck, I might like to use it on."
