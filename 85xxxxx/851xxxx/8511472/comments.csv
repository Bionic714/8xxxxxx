Props to NFRiP, and thanks to DibyaTPB for the ups."
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T19:25Z,"If it's not big enough to make me go over my limit, it's an .mkv, playable on absolutely nothing besides pc -_-"
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T19:35Z,Thanks nonetheless
,Affenkopf,2013-05-26T19:39Z,mkv is the best format! Thanks!
[V],QborT,2013-05-26T19:40Z,"Bawwww life is so hard for Death2Dipshits, can we have a moment of silence for his terrible woes.  Also .mkv's play fine on my HD media player, too bad you are probably using a gaming console... let's have another moment of silence for Death since now he's learnt that he has even more issues, shall we?  LuLz

Just a heads up, this has a watermark for ""Showstealer Pro Trial Version"" that pops up occasionally, it is ghosted so not a huge distraction."
,Crim2k8,2013-05-26T19:45Z,"Death2Dipshits:

I have a streaming media player for my television that will play .mkv files just fine. It's not as if it's new technology.

I find it helps if you're not a cheap motherfucker. The money you save downloading pirated shit can be better served by buying hardware that will play it.

It's only $80 for fuck's sake. Get a WD TV Live, or something."

The  ""Showstealer Pro Trial Version"" is a gag & part of the show, nothing to do with this being a rip:

,okbymyself,2013-05-26T20:45Z,"Yea hey dumbass, I watch MKV's thru my BluRay player everyday. Its by a company called Panasonic, and oh, its only the most popular BluRay player in the whole world."
[V],QborT,2013-05-26T20:56Z,... I got trolled by Arrested Development.  Hilarious.
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-26T21:04Z,Lots of blu-ray players can play MKVs (via USB or however you fancy). BUY ONE. AND BUY SOME BLU-RAYS TOO.
,Death2Dipshits,2013-05-26T21:06Z,"Stfu Qbort, I can play .mkv files moron, nothing else but a pc can however. Weird sarcastic bitch.
crm2k8, yeah sorry I spend money on my kid and my business, fucking faggot.
@okbymyself, ya better be, no one else okay with you."
,elvisomar,2013-05-26T22:11Z,"Death2Dipshits, I play MKV files on my Mac all the time. And from your language, I can tell you're not anybody I'd want around me. Enjoy life, and shut the fuck up, okay?"
,mambo96,2013-05-26T22:31Z,many thanks
,Cynamine,2013-05-26T22:35Z,"Hi! thanks for a torrent that isn't .ts  I was wondering if episode 2 will be up in an .mkv file?
Also, VLC media player plays .mkv no problem... just like it does with .avi"
,Cynamine,2013-05-26T22:44Z,"Hi! Thanks for the .mkv upload. I have no clue how to use those .ts files. I was wondering if you/someone was going to upload episode in an .mkv file?

Also, VLC media player plays .mkv files... it plays everything... thought everyone knew that!"
,yetisquatch,2013-05-26T23:23Z,Ready for the rest!  All other shows can wait.  Today is AD day!
,psyonikx,2013-05-26T23:51Z,"@Death2Dipshits, I normally don't post in torrent threads, because, well, it's generally irrelevant... however, I felt I had to here. I feel sorry for you and your child with that mentality and foul approach to your situation. You're not exactly setting a good example for your child with that approach. You are an example of what is wrong with the people of today, and an unfortunate provider to our future. Have a Nice Day! :)"
,richrard1,2013-05-27T00:04Z,"there is a transparent watermark occasionally, something about a trial version of some software, but its hardly noticeable and not constant"
,ledradiofloyd,2013-05-27T00:29Z,Anyone have a torrent for the whole season all together?
,yetisquatch,2013-05-27T00:47Z,That was explained above.  Its an actual joke in the show... kinda kidding that Netflix didn't pay Fox for the rights to show footage from earlier shows.  Its there intentionally.
,richrard1,2013-05-27T01:29Z,"yeah, signed up for a netflix trial and still saw the watermark, looked it up, and finally got the joke. sorry"
,simple_man815,2013-05-27T01:46Z,MOAR!
,eatsh1t,2013-05-27T01:56Z,"I downloaded this and the quality is very, very grainy. Not even close to 720p. Fully downloaded, nothing missing."
[T],karmax264,2013-05-27T06:39Z,"@Death2Dipshits

MKVtoMP4 .222 will take an MKV's video and audio and put it in a MP4.  Takes about a minute depending on the size of the file.  Works like a champ.  "

[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-27T16:29Z,"This is not HD. If you want a much better, real HD copy, get http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8513702/Arrested.Development.S04E01.720p.WEBRip.x264-QRUS"
,iratethep,2013-05-27T17:48Z,"Shit quality.

Framerate is jerky, and audio is a little out of sync."
,sounddd,2013-05-27T22:57Z,"Can confirm was GoodFirm says. QRUS looks MUCH better, the NFRiP release looks like absolute shit. Even the non HD x264 releases look better."
,bon-bongo,2013-05-29T15:03Z,"Bad quality - VERY blurry. Please, don't download that dreck."
