Rotastic is an addictive 2D arcade game, offering
accessible, innovative and original gameplay, and a
huge dose of fun without taking itself too
seriously. Behind very simple swinging mechanics
hides a deep gameplay with numerous possibilities
to challenge your reflexes, ingenuity, and skills!
Collect items, escape deadly traps, send your
opponents flying to their doom, smash bricks
execute aerial acrobatics, burst chickens to dust
and feathers, or top the fastest speedruns! The
solo campaign spreading across 7 worlds and nearly
70 levels offers hours of fun, with a wide range of
gameplay to value replayability! Pit your skills
against your friends and the players from around
the world by beating the best scores for every one
of each level! Rotastic offers local battle mode
for up to 4 players to either race for item
collecting, or tried-and-true deathmatch
Multiplayer is intense and full of fun!
