We Love Life is the seventh studio album by Pulp. Released on 22 October 2001 in the UK, and is the band's last album. It reached number 6 in the UK album charts, with a total chart stay of only three weeks.[1]
It is notable for being produced by Scott Walker, whose own album 'Til The Band Comes In is mocked in the lyrics of the song "Bad Cover Version". Cocker claims the lyric was written long before Walker became involved in the album's production.
In October 2011 a petition was started at PulpWiki.net to have a deluxe version of the album released.
