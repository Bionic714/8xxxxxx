,tflagger997,2013-05-26T21:32Z,"There is no NFO, and there is no information about this movie in either of the text files trying to get us to leave TPB.  At least there is a small sample.

Same old blurred watermark video, but the audio is confirmed TS.  So pair the audio with better video and jackpot!"

V:3 Very pixelated and washed out
A:5 It is Line, but Out of Sync quite a bit"
