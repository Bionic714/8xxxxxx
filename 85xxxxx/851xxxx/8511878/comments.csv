Even if its compressed it would still be near impossible.  Just a warning so no one is disappointed :)"

do you see any video missing? It's quality is actually really good, and you could download just part of that torrent and stop moaning;) "
,szymen90,2013-06-01T18:37Z,Size of files does not always relate with its quality. Download just one video and you'll see its a good torrent. Besides in a filelist you can see there's no video missing.
,anterior2dasuperior,2013-06-04T12:34Z,"Why don't you chill just a little bit szymen90!  Of course I looked at all of the files, I didn't even have to download them to determine the quality.  I stand by exactly what I posted.  And you told me to ""stop moaning""???  Are you serious, what would I be moaning about?  I am just informing peeps and giving my opinion, I am allowed to do that.  I have all of these videos and am not upset that they aren't complete and how in the world does informing potential downloaders of info mean that I'm moaning???  And I made one post, I didn't go on and on; you actually posted twice.  I actually started off my comments by stating ""Thank you to the uploader""  and then I said ""just an FYI"".  There weren't many seeders at the time so if people were looking for every single video made for Step 3 by Kaplan from 2008-2010 they definitely would NOT find it here.  But a big thanks to the uploader because every subject is here for sure and everything is covered.  The topic states ""A Complete Collection of Kaplan Videos 2008-2010"" and that is not true.  I knew when I posted that it didn't contain everything and probably just had one set of every subject and it does.  There are more videos and I have them, there are more videos of Fischer doing Imaging, Hematology, Rheumatology and Pulmonology.  Plus there are videos during 2008-2010 of Fischer AND Faselis doing CCS approach, heck there are videos from 2004 that tackle CCS so you would think it would be here but there aren't.  This upload definitely does have every subject covered at least once but if someone who really loves Fischer's teaching, which so many people do, they might be disappointed that the title is a little misleading because it says ""a complete collection from 2008-2010"" and if there's no Imaging by Fischer and no CCS video and the aforementioned then its not complete.  There were also some more Biostats videos made that aren't here but that's all good.  I have these in my files so I can compare, but you are right in that every subject is covered at least once by one lecturer.  Chill out dude, just cuz you're sad and frustrated about whatever is bothering you doesn't mean you have to be negative and say that I'm ""moaning"" simply because I am informing those who might think they are getting every video made for Step 3 that Kaplan put out during that time period.  This download might take awhile unless there are more seeders quick and that's why I was informing people, so they would know what they were waiting for.  Again I will say someone who possesses all of these vids and thanks the uploader while informing isn't moaning.  Moaning would be someone who is disappointed because they spent a lot of time downloading and then was disappointed and complained...you might want to get a little more education on your adjectives buddy."

Well I think you've overreacted a little. Yes, I did say that you are moaning and if you felt offended then I'm sorry;) But you could as well share all missing videos that you have (also for step 2, where you also made a statement about videos missing). "
