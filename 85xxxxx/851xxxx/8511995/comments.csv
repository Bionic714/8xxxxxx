With W4F & psspss uploading this show why bother?"
[V],psspss,2013-05-27T04:45Z,"not many download it.. seems theres not many fans for the show but thats the fault of aussie.. and all these region locking shit..

usa and other countries except NZ never get to see the show

and one would fo thought many animal lovers would be watching it after all..

so yeah normally the first to upload a episode gets all the traffic normally its about 20 max! almost hardly worth doing the series really but sicne I watch it and rip it for myself

however if yours is better quality.. then others will want it over other rips

w4g is mp4 so those who love mp4 will grab that
and mine xvids avi so people grab that who want that format. 

so if you encode a h264 dont use avi on end.. its really a mp4 container not a xvid/avi container"
