,topk,2013-05-27T05:48Z,"The game is awesome! I pirated it and now I will buy it - it's only $14 on Steam!
I never used to like top-down-view isometric type games, I HATE strategy shit like StarCarft etc. But I just tried this Van Helsing game and I LOVE it! I cannot stop playing it, it's addicting as hell!

Anyway, awesome game! Addictive "
