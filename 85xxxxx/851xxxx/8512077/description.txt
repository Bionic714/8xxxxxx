Every day, day in and day out, you project an aura of energy which others can sense.  Some of this energy is simply a projection of your bio-electric field, and all it tells them is ΓÇ£something living is near meΓÇ¥.  But there is more to your aura.  Much more.

You project, and others can subconsciously sense, a lot of information about yourself through your aura, including your emotional state and what you believe about yourself.  Because of this, and the fact that others do subconsciously sense and respond to this auric information, you can use subliminals to adjust your aura by telling your subconscious mind what you want it to ΓÇ£sayΓÇ¥.  The result?  Others will sense and respond to what you consciously want them to sense and respond to.  They will begin treating you the way you want them to.

In this case, you can tell your subconscious mind that you want others to percieve you as being sexy, and respond appropriately.  This title can be used by either gender, and can be used successfully by anyone of any sexual orientation.
