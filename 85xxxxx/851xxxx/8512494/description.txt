^^^ NOTES - Nice 720p source used on this, so i created a custom subfile for the foreign parts and hardcoded them for the 8 lines needed, did a resize, then messed with contrast, gamma, levels and sharpen, Audio is some highspec line synced and muxed to the video, enjoy.

I also included the .srt file for the subs needed if anyone wants, i just thought id share :)
