[T],iqeiqe,2013-05-27T01:17Z,"Namorax, yeah, the Disney re-dub is widely available. However, the original Fox-Streamline dubbed version is not as widespread. I personally like the Fox version much better, and I don't believe I'm the only one that feels that way. With that in mind, I decided to get this out there. "

Now to find a version which is 1) wide screen, 2) non-Disney, 3) playable! If there isn’t any, then too bad, 'cause this movie is very good! "
[T],iqeiqe,2013-06-13T01:09Z,"DeRater, you're welcome. 

I'm afraid I don't understand your third comment. The video works fine with any major codec pack as far as I'm aware, and my iPhone plays it flawlessly, so I would imagine it's not very demanding on a system's hardware to playback. 

As for the first and second, I covered that in the description. This video was never released in widescreen combined with the Streamline dub because Disney acquired the rights to the film not too long thereafter. I also mentioned that there is a 1080p (widescreen, I believe Disney BluRay sourced) with the Streamline dub audio muxed in floating around on TBP. 

Anyway, I hope that clarified up the situation. Thanks for the feedback!"
