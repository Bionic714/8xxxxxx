Video was encoded from the DVD source of the original Streamline/Fox english dub of this movie. It's in a full-screen SD 640x480 resolution due to the nature of the source itself. There is a dub-over-raw version floating around (1080p) if would like to grab that instead. 


Video: 640x480, x264
Audio: Stereo AAC-LC
Container: MP4

If it means anything to anyone, you can probably add this to your mobile device and probably any other device capable of playing h264 video without any problem. 

Anyway, I usually don't do these types of releases, but the lack of available copies of the Fox dub disturbed me. Feel free to leave any questions and/or comments and I'll try to get back at them. 

Enjoy.
