Audio was fine overall but the video doesn't look all that good."
,awdudeno,2013-05-27T04:02Z,"Not that I'm complaining.  I'm certainly thankful for this, as I don't plan on getting the other options available at the moment that are the size of movies."
,hatepig,2013-05-27T07:59Z,Kalambaka works for netflix.
,newtricks2,2013-05-27T15:41Z,"thank you ettv,    final a user that can upload a 30 min episode in good quality that is around 200 mb, unlike all these other piece of shit useless idiots,    why should a 30 minute tv show be over 1 gig?,    thanks again,   love you "
,vettukal,2013-05-27T20:58Z,"This works. The vid quality is good enough to watch. Though its not HD, Its above 360p. Audio is also very good. Thanks uploader."
,presshere,2013-05-28T04:12Z,Good Rip..worth downloading..thank you for putting up this amazing show
,land_stander,2013-05-29T12:38Z,I noticed the watermark fading in and then out at 2:30. (Showstealer Pro - Trial VErsion) - is this on all of them? Nobody else see this?-
,THRobinson,2013-05-30T05:26Z,Was about to post the same thing... watermark for video ripping software comes up every 5min or so.
,christo7,2013-05-31T10:41Z,Showstealer Pro Trial Version is a meta in-joke. Come on now.
