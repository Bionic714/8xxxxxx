,nycguy83,2013-05-27T22:17Z,Is there an app to watch these on android? MX player isn't working. Thx
,kemcolian822,2013-05-28T08:29Z,"@nycguy83

Install Mx player pro (search on google for free download links). It runs avi files just fine on my device. May be something to do with your android device?"
,nycguy83,2013-05-28T13:29Z,"Yeah it does, I just had to turn on SW Decoder local in the settings BEFORE I opened the files. Then refreshing my folders they all appear too."
,nycguy83,2013-05-28T13:32Z,"BTW it's hilarious so far, thru ep 4 at least... Except this ep 2, not the best. Don't give up, the next one is classic, Lindsay and Tobias.

I'm not getting Netflix but I want to donate $ directly to the cast, crew and writers/producers bec this is making me so happy. Much better than season 3."
,babymeow,2013-05-28T20:59Z,audio quality 5/10 at best
