I think I wanna hit her next"
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-05-28T03:08Z,"Good stuff, but, unfortunately, a very slow download..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-29T04:49Z,seed? been downloading for over a day but stuck at 43.5% for hours
,muckymucks,2013-05-30T08:02Z,"There's no seeds. Kerosine_Monkey, taking a day off, mate?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-30T16:01Z,"i know this uploader *knows how* to seed it properly, 'cause they have seeded a bigger set than this one before.

very frustrating!"
,Kerosine_Monkey,2013-06-02T04:15Z,I seeded it. Geez. Quit your complaining. You act like I ain't doing this Simply cause I'm a nice guy. No one is paying me? This is illegal so I ain't getting famous? I can't put it on a job application? Calm your damn tits. I gotta turn my laptop off at some point or else it will break and then Who is gonna make you torrents?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-02T20:07Z,"no offense intended, but it doesn't take a week to seed a 2 GB torrent. i don't think anyone was being rude to you by asking what was going on. there are many uploaders every month who post big torrents and downloaders end up wasting their time and bandwidth, but don't get anything to show for it.

thank you very much for coming back and seeding it."
