From the Infowars web site :: On the Sunday edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex covers a wide range of topics with animator, director, screenwriter, actor, and musician Mike Judge. The man behind Beavis & Butt-Head and King of the Hill talks about his 2006 movie Idiocracy and sounds off on a number of different issues including gun control and Hollywood. 

Alex airs Infowars Nightly News reporter Lee Ann McAdoo's special report covering Saturday's March Against Monsanto. McAdoo interviews author Jeffrey Smith about the health effects of GMO. She also talks with the Center for Peace and Justice about GMO labeling and Food Is Free Project about food sovereignty and aquaponics. 

Alex and Coast to Coast talk show host John B. Wells examine the massive scandals engulfing the White House and the accelerating panic by the government to demonize all opposing voices.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
