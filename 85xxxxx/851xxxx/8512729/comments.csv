,PurityDeath,2013-05-27T03:22Z,Where's the rest of 'em !?
,bno112300,2013-05-27T03:32Z,"I noticed you uploaded before changing the filenames. (probably because you wanted to upload fresh out of the encoder, it's nice to see you have your priorities in order)
I suggest doing a neat sort if you plan to upload the rest of the season. (Ideally with all of S04 in one torrent)

You're still in the lead as far as releases go, for now."
,margrave,2013-05-27T03:37Z,are there only 8 episodes? i thought there were more
,PurityDeath,2013-05-27T04:29Z,There are 15. Maybe SOMEONE should finish off torrenting the series if he wants props while putting down other uploaders.
,dualwieldkatana,2013-05-27T04:39Z,IMDB shows 11 episodes this only has 8...
,dualwieldkatana,2013-05-27T04:40Z,15*

,brxbrx2,2013-05-27T14:20Z,"Damn ads posing as magnet links.  TPB, I know you need the revenue, but come on, at least keep the basic functions of the site clean."

,machspee,2013-05-29T07:53Z,"hey guys 

What is the source name to these episodes?  Is it WEBRip-NFRiP or any other name? "
[V],politux,2013-05-29T10:36Z,"I didn't rename the files, this is how they were tagged."
,farahad,2013-05-29T10:39Z,Kudos to politux for upping this.  Much appreciated.  Shame about the 1kb/sec dl rate.  
,tomslayer92,2013-05-29T14:59Z,what is up with the random skips at the beginning of each episode? so very very very annoying.
,coldpluto,2013-05-29T15:27Z,Hi politux do you have regular SD mp4 files?
[V],politux,2013-05-29T16:33Z,"@tomslayer92

What media player are you using?  I'd go with VLC."
,checho_0,2013-05-30T12:27Z,Please seed! My torrent is stuck @ 95% TY very much upper man.
,blee10988,2013-05-30T22:29Z,judging from the size these are 720p??....glad you thought talking shit was more important than release info!....looks like ill have to wait for a GOOD complete rip
,jimmyjyc,2013-05-31T08:12Z,"@politux

I'm also getting the skips, and I'm using VLC."
,Aator80,2013-05-31T17:24Z,"Just a quick comment that you'll see a ""Showstealer Pro Trial Version"" watermark in the episodes, during scenes from the previous seasons.  This is an original part of the episodes as they were broadcast on Netflix and is a gag by the show."
,datisit,2013-06-01T13:37Z,"@politux

I too am getting skips at the beginning. VLC, or Finder preview, same deal. "
,piratiinho,2013-06-06T18:17Z,"All the files have parts of the beginning missing. This is annoying, download other torrents."
,flakelviv,2013-06-08T19:40Z,Confirming skips at the beginning.
,Baator,2013-06-08T20:31Z,"Just fyi, there are NO SUBTITLES available at this moment for this release."
