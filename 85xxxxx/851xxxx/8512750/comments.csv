No quality comments?"
,iratethep,2013-05-27T17:49Z,"If the quality is as with ep 1, it's total shit."
,kiwij,2013-05-28T12:32Z,This is different release group to both of Dibya's S04E01 uploads.
,paradox56,2013-05-29T07:48Z,"The quality for this one is average at best. It looked somewhat blurry, definitely not HD (and nowhere near as good as the QROS release for episode 1). There was also a Playstation disconnected sign or something around the middle. What the heck was that? At first I thought it'd be another joke from the show (like the ""showstealer"" watermark, which was hilarious), but it seemed pretty random.

As for the audio, Ron Howard and Jason Bateman sound like the Kardashians.

Anyway,

V: 6.5
A: 4

Dibya, thanks for the upload (regardless of the quality, I really appreciate what you do, since you're my main source for HDTV rips), but is there any chance you could upload a better version for this season? I've looked everywhere and haven't been able to find a decent HD rip in any torrent site.

Thanks!"
