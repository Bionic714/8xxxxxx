Hell Yeah! is a crazy action-adventure platformer. In Hell. You are Ash, a devil rabbit and the prince of Hell. When some jerk finds it funny to post your secret intimate photos all over the Hell-ternet, you get VERY angry. Time to seek him out and destroy him once and for all. While youΓÇÖre at it, why not use this incredible journey to kill everybody else? ItΓÇÖs you against all Hell. ItΓÇÖs Hell Yeah!

Kick-ass features this game definitely has:

Tension-relieving faux-gore action ΓÇô Hell Yeah! helps you clear your mind after a bad/frustrating/boring day at work. Achieve this by exploring the four corners of Hell and exterminating monsters in a cheerful yet challenging atmosphere.

Drill to kill ΓÇô shooting is fun but shooting from a super sawing jetpack that can drill through walls and squash monsters into chunks is better. Hell Yeah! gives you full frontal violence in your face.

This game is too BIG for you ΓÇô 10 huge game worlds with secret areas and side quests, hundreds of objects, weapons and monsters to collect. If youΓÇÖre a completionist, youΓÇÖre screwed man.

Help us make Hell a cleaner place ΓÇô there are 100 unique monsters to exterminate in Hell Yeah! Some are rude, others are really ugly but they all equally deserve to DIE!

ΓÇ£Finish himΓÇ¥ moves that will make your mama cry ΓÇô inflict ultimate humiliation on the monsters of Hell using over 25 deadly ΓÇ£Finish him!ΓÇ¥ mini-games.

Pimp my drill ΓÇô collect loot and spend your cash in big shops where you can buy bigger guns and awesome upgrades for your ride. The donut driller skin and the ΓÇÿSploding Carrot Missile Launcher make a lovely combo.
