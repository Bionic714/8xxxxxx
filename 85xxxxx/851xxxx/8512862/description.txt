Join our study in Revelation 3:7-13 "Philadelphia: Church With An Open Door" - Taught by Brett Meador
The church in Biblical Philadelphia receives only commendation from Jesus. As we continue reading through the seven churches in Revelation 3, study the substance in keeping the Word of God. Herein we learn the meaning of the Key of David, looking to Jesus. Be one who shares Jesus with others, even as the church in Philadelphia, the church with an open door.
