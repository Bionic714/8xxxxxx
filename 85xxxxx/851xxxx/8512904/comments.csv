,baatezu_,2013-05-27T09:50Z,"Sample is nice, thank you for the release."
,Osiris69,2013-05-28T04:26Z,"Save yourselves all the trouble I went through trying to find a good copy.  Download this copy if you want a full, complete, V:8/A:5 Cam copy that is the best I've found so far.  This is almost as good as a DVD screener if it wasn't for the Cam video and mono audio.

Just my humble opinion."

,Durham183,2013-05-28T19:07Z,"ive looked around for a decent copy of this since it theaters and i have to say this is the best one ive found as of 5/28/13. im sure if you wait a little longer there will be a better one, but this is definitely watchable.

,AcornBBCnut,2013-05-29T12:52Z,"I've seen a lot of comments reporting that the first five minutes are missing - from the torrent description, I think you have indeed worked some time on this and am prepared to give it a try.

Remember, however, if the first five minutes are missing, you will have gone down quite a lot in my estimation, in fact you would've gone to the point where I would pity your existance.

If on the other hand, this is a complete copy and all you say proves to be correct, then you sir, are legend.

Have a nice day! :)"
,tflagger997,2013-05-29T16:13Z,@Durham183 - Why are you cut/pasting the same review onto different releases?  HQ TS LiNE-CPG only has Audio @ 128 while this is @ 256 (a world of difference).
,tflagger997,2013-05-30T04:50Z,"""doing lipsync was a pita, took me 6h and good 120 cuts, now everything is perfect""

Too bad that was not tested before that comment was made.  The audio constantly drifts out of sync, and then there is a jarring audio glitch, and it is back in sync for a short while before it starts drifting again.  So A:4 (this does not sound like 256 Kbps TS) and V:5 (far too dark for many scenes, and that stupid adaptive blur that takes up a large portion of the lower right corner).  If it had simply been blackened out it would have been much, much better.  The constant adapting draws your attention to it constantly.

this is the best quality cam that is out there... the only thing that bothered me was the CPG guy's watermark for about the first 5 minutes of the movie... but other than that this is a great cam fix!!! thank you uploader!!"

Loved the movie by the way.  :)"

For cam good quality.

,justmealwatts,2013-06-07T16:52Z,"For me, the movie was totally watchable and it's really not a movie to watch at home, especially for the cam quality that it is but like I said, it was watchable.

Spock:  Where to now Captain?

Kirk:  I don't know Spock. Why don't you take over for a while because Ms. Markus and I are going to get it on, if you know what I mean.

Spock: OK Jim. Bartle Doo !!!"
,RaKinstack,2013-06-08T01:01Z,"big closet trekkie here... im in it as much for the story as the action, if not more so. saw it in theaters. visually stunning.... lots of flash bang and action. story wise, something was lacking. at least for me. I was disappointed. Hard to say why exactly it didn't work for me... after the first movie in 2009 i left feeling enthralled and totally elated, after this one... I just felt blah and..I dont know... its hard to explain. it was missing the..heart or something, that the first one had. IMO of course. Others may not see it like that. Anyhow, if you really want to watch it, you owe it to yourself to see it on the big screen, music and scenery and visuals are amazing.... cant believe what they can do for VFX these days... as far as effects these aint ur parents star trek thats 4 sure."
,mikedongs,2013-06-10T04:00Z,"I really didn't like this movie very much. It has nothing to do with the quality. I just didn't like the movie. I am a huge Star Trek fan. I really liked the 2009 movie. I wasn't huge on the original series. I think TNG is the best thing to ever carry the ST name.

I'm kinda with RaKinstack on this one. Into Darkness is missing something that the last film had. I'm not even totally sure how to explain it either. This just didn't do it for me."
