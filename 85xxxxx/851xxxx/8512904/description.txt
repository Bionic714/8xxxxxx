Notes: got this nice hd cam cpl days ago, just didnt have audio for it yet
it consists of 3 different cams 1h50mins perfect cam, than 10mins good cam, only
last 2 mins has flickeringall in all a great source to begin with, worked over
days on it.

Video:

had to cut the video in 3 parts and adjusted each as needed.
cam had low colours and needed adjustment in brightness, contrast and rgb
colours shifted a bit especially red, so had to find a middle way, some scenes
are a bit more red some have still too less, there is no perfect way for it,
but looks very good now.
made it a bit brighter as needed, but there are some darker scenes, which are
looking better now.
have already watch my video, so i can tell you its worth it.
translated the klingon subs to english and hardcoded them into my video, without
them you wont know whats goin on at this spot.

Audio:

took milleniums line audio, was really nice, nothing to complain about
doing lipsync was a pita, took me 6h and good 120 cuts, now everything is
perfect

looks very nice
enjoy
