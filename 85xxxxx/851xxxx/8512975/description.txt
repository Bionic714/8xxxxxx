I searched for this for several years before finally giving up and gathering them up myself.  I didn't code these, I just downloaded them individually and compiled them.  This is the first and probably last time I've ever created a torrent, so If I screwed it up, I'll apologize now ^_^

Tales of the Wizard of Oz is a series of short cartoons from the 60's based on The Wizard of Oz (surprise!).  They ran them again in Canada in the 80's or 90's when I was a wee one, and I just loved them.  I couldn't find all of them, but here's what I could get.

They're MP4 format, the quality is pretty good though the sound is a bit muffled.  Definitely watchable, though I wouldn't try it on a 50" plasma :)

I'll seed as much as possible, but I don't have a dedicated machine for uploading and I have to work on this PC.

Hope you enjoy them as much as I did. 

Cheers!
