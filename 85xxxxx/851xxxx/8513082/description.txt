The Character BuilderΓäó is a standalone tool that lets non-animators create animated presentations involving characters and supporting visuals. The Character Builder can render materials in the Macromedia FlashΓäó SWF format, the new HTML5 format, as well as leading video formats.

The Character Builder comes with royalty-free, ready-to-animate characters in a wide range of styles. Additional characters available in the form of Character Packs and Addon Packs. Many characters can be customized directly within the Character Builder, and additional customization is also available through our Service Desk. Meanwhile, the optional Extensibility Kit gives savvy artists access to the powerful underlying artwork model, and includes sample art files in leading 3d and vector formats.

The Character Builder supports high-quality Speech Packs as an alternative to recorded audio. Speech Packs are high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) engines that specifically permit the redistribution of the resulting audio within Builder-generated files.
