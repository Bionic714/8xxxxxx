,metrowestjp,2013-06-05T00:00Z,Curious why no one on any of the torrent sites is uploading s01e07 that aired two days ago. There were like six uploads for each of the previous episodes. Was there some kind of crackdown?
,stewie01,2013-06-05T01:22Z,Wondering about the Episode too.  No one has it....
