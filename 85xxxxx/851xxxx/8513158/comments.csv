,syscheck,2013-05-27T23:36Z,"Isn't that a Human Rights violation? Or Ethnic Cleansing of that episode? I know Memorial Day is dark and full of terrors, but never figured it would be this bad. Shouldn't we be standing up against it's crudeness? Hunger strike for Episode Rights? Lit ourselves on fire at HBO, shouting Valar Morghulis? I mean, what did these millions die for anyway, if the basic benefits simply can be postponed? 

Did Florence stop the bleeding next week? Was Martin having a Dream pause? Did the prince kiss Snowwhite only after the break? Sorry, We watch therefore we are! And certainly us, the Honest Torrenting Elite, counting our lives in gigabytes, not willing to pay anything of course, after the deep misery of 15 minutes delay after the broadcast, before the first torrent comes out.

And what do Denaerys and her troops do all week? Probably causing more Memorial Days, apart from the books. And what to tell Leon? Hang in there? No.. 

Awaiting Summer Suffering with no Season.04 at all.. Suicide is not even an option. You'd miss all future seasons. You could however torture your enemies by donating George Martin's books to them, containing every SPOILER for many years. If you already did so to friends, they're probably your enemies by now. Anyway, perhaps stay Valar Dormentis, until the new season starts. "

,syscheck,2013-05-28T04:20Z,"A 10 / V 10. And very sync from beginning to end. This is a very good copy, HDTV 16:9. Perhaps a very tiny bit too sharp, but I like this AVI-XVID-sharpness more than I usually see in MKV. Anyway, perfect download. Uploader, many thanks, good job!"
