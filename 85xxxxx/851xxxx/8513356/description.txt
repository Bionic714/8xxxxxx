So as I was adding this torrent, music started playing. Turns out AdBlock Plus had turned itself off and a popunder had come up and started playing Bullets And Bathsalt by Wesley James. At first I was kinda creeped out, but then I realised that the music is actually pretty good. The Ron Jeramy penis enlargement ads kinda repulse me though; I'll leave Adblock on.
