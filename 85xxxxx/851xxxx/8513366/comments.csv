,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2013-05-27T14:02Z,thanks
,Mr_Ceiling_Cat,2013-05-27T14:05Z,"Place Update.5 into your game installation folder and run it

Choose ""yes to all"" when asked if you want to replace files

On main menu, bottom right corner, game version should be 1.0.0.4 if successfully updated

no need for previous updates

support the devs, because i wont!"
,idleloss,2013-05-28T00:12Z,Thanks for the info Mr. Ceiling Cat.
,idleloss,2013-05-28T00:16Z,"Erm it appears installing the update removed my saved game. No biggie for me since I didn't play much before the update, but watch out for it."
,XtraZoom,2013-05-28T22:15Z,"It appears neocoregames is going for the record of daily update.

Update 5 is 1.0.04 right? Then there is newer 1.0.05 then 1.0.05B and at this moment it is 1.0.06 latest update from steam which neocoregames is not even showing any changelog yet."
,pcbflare,2013-05-29T12:35Z,does this work with reloaded version?
,ZtorkX86,2013-05-29T17:14Z,"idleloss@It's possible they changed profile, meaning the location will be different. If you remember the original file names you can try and search for them.

For a convenient way to search files on windows I recommend the application ""Everything"", just google it."
,XtraZoom,2013-05-30T10:29Z,"Goole the save location and look for your saves there. Legit steam games will be located in some random numbers within Documents NeocoreGames  Van Helsing sub folder. I believe Reloaded games are also located there but not in random numbers folder.


Win 8 save location:
C  :    Users   Username    Documents    NeocoreGames    Van Helsing  SaveGame"
,krazykyle,2013-05-30T16:28Z,first there is 1 and then theres 2 and now theres 5. That escalated quickly!
,GObonzo,2013-05-30T17:38Z,"cannot enchant after latest update. windows stays blank now when trying to insert weapons, armor, items."
,XtraZoom,2013-05-30T18:17Z,"GObonzo, 1.0.04 broken enchantments so 1.0.05 fixed it. LOL"
