As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size a bit in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a bit and enjoy!
