'Saloon'

Yahoo Productions, 1973, 28 pages

Written and Illustrated by Dave Geiser

Probably not for everyone, and probably not Geiser's best work, but I really dig this guys artwork. I always enjoy looking at his books.

As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size a bit in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a bit and enjoy!
