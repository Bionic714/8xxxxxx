,cechant,2013-05-27T23:09Z,"Hi
I am very sorry my internet is too slow ;
I need more seeds,I can't do anything to sped my internet.
Thanks for any help."
,maddog7777,2013-05-28T02:39Z,"@cechant- It really depends on the initial seeder kingashi to seed because if he does not seed long enough then the torrent is useless. I noticed it does not go past 4 seeders, but now I see it is at zero. So with all the leechers, you might a while DL this small file. "
,ualani510,2013-05-28T03:17Z,Oh-OH. Thanks to kingashi posting this FTX isn't going to release FTX Global. At least that's what he claimed would happen if he didn't pull SAK.
,maddog7777,2013-05-28T03:56Z,"@ualani510- He did pull it, but someone else posted it. Fullterrain is not going to not release FTXGlobal. Here is how it goes. If Fullterrain does not release FTXGlobal they lose all together and all the time they put into it. Very costly for them! If they release it, they make what ever they can off of it and only risk someone cracking it and posting it. They have more to gain releasing it and more to lose if they don't. I am guessing it will not be downloadable but would only be purchasable in a DVD-Boxed set. Kingashi claimed it was legal reasons, he also claimed he had issues with the torrent itself and then he claimed he had removed it to avoid Fullterrain not releasing FTXGlobal..... No disrespect for kingashi, but I think he only removed it because he was threatened by what we like to call scare punks that are out all over torrent sites world wide and nothing more. No member of Fullterrain.com made any threats about pulling down Alaska or Wales.......Besides, the guy who claimed to be a developer of Alaska and Wales was not even a member of Fullterrain nor was this guy part of the development team. I think when people are going to come on here and make threats that they work for or are part of some company, might want to research a bit who actually works for that company...LMAO....."
,fade_away,2013-05-28T04:52Z,"Orbx/FTX have said they are no longer releasing DVD products. Everything will be download only (with an option to order a burnable DVD for more $) from now on. 

I have no issue buying products like FTX global because I know it will effect every aspect of flight sim. I have also bought REX, and OPUS, and a few FSDT products because they offer them at reasonable prices and discounted. 

However, products like iFLY Cockpit builders edition (500 euro), prosim737 (600 euro) are priced out of reach; I would appreciate a working crack if possible. 

This torrent now has zero seeds. If you really want it, go to the russian tracker originally posted, or direct download from the german forum. Or you could be just patient enough for someone to repost and reseed."
,kingashi,2013-05-28T07:50Z,have some patience guys.....jeez
,kingashi,2013-05-28T07:51Z,"@ ualani510

REQ: FSCaptain latest version."
,cechant,2013-05-28T10:29Z,A lot of thanks to all the seeders.
,tornade25,2013-05-28T13:10Z,Thank you kingashi ;-))
,aarque,2013-05-28T13:22Z,"Good to see you back behind the wheel kingashi.
 In completely unrelated news, TPB has apparently reached a new low. Both sidebar banners in my browser have the little image of a French policeman levitating a transparent book: http://support.hostgator.com/img/articles/sslWarning.png
Which means Firefox is telling me that whatever site is hosting the banner is a known security risk and TPB is accepting money from it's owners in exchange for loading the banners into our web pages."
,kingashi,2013-05-28T21:23Z,"@ Cesah

Even i am looking for it lol."
,jaggy1963,2013-05-29T16:43Z,"These Airports are lovely, Thanks Kingashi."
