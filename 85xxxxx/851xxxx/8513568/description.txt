"The most obvious challenge involved in scripting Mutant World was to guide a character whom I sympathized through a shattered, hostile land populated by ohter hungry mutants, militaristic busybodies, deceiving women, and at least one religious maniac without warm, nurturing aspect of human personality, to witness that even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of man. I failed dismally. Dimento is treated horribly by the other characters and I must shoulder the blame for his misfortunes." - Jan Strnad
