Nelson Mandela's 70th Birthday Tribute Concert (DVD5)

Wembley Stadium on June 11 1988 was the venue for a unique gathering of musicians and performers from all over the world, who under the banner of Artists Against Apartheid, paid tribute to Nelson Mandela for his 70th Birthday.

An audience estimated to be well over half a billion people in some 63 countries participated in an event with a simple but compelling message: "Free Nelson Mandela". It was a message which reached into the prisons of apartheid.

 A letter smuggled out by one prisoner to the Anti-Apartheid Movement read:

 "The sweet sounds of Wembley still reverberate in the ears of every political prisoner in South Africa. Not the high walls, not the electrified barbed-wire, not the iron-bars and edict upon edict could prevent your message reaching us. We are inspired, encouraged, and immeasurably strengthened". 

The message captured the imagination of millions of people who have joined in the campaign to free Nelson Mandela, and all other political prisoners, and to end the tyranny of apartheid. 

This DVD covers the highlights of that day including two tracks by Dire Straits and Eric Clapton. Dire Straits appeared as the closing act of that unforgettable day with Eric Clapton on second guitar. Until today, it was probably the most important and powerful concert in the Dire Straits history.
