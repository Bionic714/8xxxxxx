Thanks TvTeam for bringing us the QRUS goods."
,press2012,2013-05-27T22:58Z,I thought that this was a better effort than Arrested.Development.S04E01.720p DibyaTPB but I did not see any other eps from TvTeam for the subsequent eps. Anyone know if they are coming. TIA.
,paradox56,2013-05-29T03:40Z,"It's been a huge pain in the ass to find decent rips and comments on audio/video quality without getting spoiled, so I have to say it: THANK YOU. Great video and audio quality. It has some barely noticeable stuttering, but, like I said, it's barely noticeable.

So,

A: 9
V: 9

If you're looking for a 720p rip, give this one a go! I'll now try rips from other groups (PLS and PublicHD I think) for the next episodes and see if that works.

Great to see AD back again, by the way. Hurwitz did a magnificent job and I can't wait to watch the rest of the season!"
,paradox56,2013-05-29T07:50Z,"TvTeam, please, please, PLEASE upload more episodes like this one! This is the only real HD rip I've found. Netflix isn't available in my country, by the way, so no, that's not really an option.

Thanks in advance!"
