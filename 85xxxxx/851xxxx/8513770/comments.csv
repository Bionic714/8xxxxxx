I was in for a long drive, and this totally saved the day!

I will do what i usually do. Download it, and if i like it (which i did), i buy it on amazon, and mail it directly to an institution/school etc where it will become more usefull than on my shelf.

If you have any more Military/Seal/Specops books, it would be greatly appreciated!"
