,notime4BS,2013-05-27T19:06Z,How is the film's aspect ratio butchered by cropping if the only thing that's removed are the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen?

,LOLicopter,2013-05-30T08:09Z,"bordo84, what is it you need explained to you, exactly?  This isn't rocket science.  Cropping out the black bars on the bottom and top of the screen generally means you have to crop out the sides of the picture too.  This means you are LOSING original movie detail that was filmed into the scene.  Capisce?

It's simple.  If you don't like uncut movies, don't download these.  However, if you do like your movies cropped, download those instead.  You're being provided a choice here, and choice is good.

,bordo84,2013-05-30T14:00Z,LOLicopter yeah thanks man for explaining .. but i understood that much i just dont see what kind of detail i miss i mean only on the sides of the picture which you barely notice? or detail in the whole picture?
,LOLicopter,2013-05-30T23:35Z,"It depends on the movie and the director.  There are movies where important details are shown on the very edge of the frame.  Many directors have a vision for their film.  Everything in the frame is intended to be there and seen by the viewer.  Cropping these details out won't ruin the movie or prevent you from figuring out what's going on, but you don't get the full effect.  You're not seeing the movie as the filmmaker intended you to see it.  "

vonRicht explains this on a previous release (the last stand)

https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8463349/The.Last.Stand.2013.RERIP.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD-7.1.x264-Grym

But it's not what i thought it was. Other rips are not removing any of the image (ie., cropping sides of images), they are just removing the black bars which results in the image being stretched slightly so the picture fills more of the screen.

I prefer it this way and set my player to do this with all videos."
