The last episode I saw, the one with the rock band The Seeds, I noticed was written by Don Nelson [not the NBA coach!], Ozzie's brother who wrote a lot of Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. So I was thinking I wonder if Ozzie Nelson appeared on this show as well, considering the Ozzie Snick reference from Don Nelson."
