Part 3 doesn't come out until tomorrow... and yet you uploaded this 4 days ago.

It will take RogueTranslator at least 3 months to translate it into English.

Even then, what's this ""QUEEN.ISO"" bullshit?  MGQ is a direct download game...  no CDs, no ISOs, no chance to exploit people's misconfigured CD autoplay settings.  (I suppose one could put an exploit into the EXE and none would be the wiser, but that would require being a script kiddie slightly more intelligent than dirt...)

The current best torrent for getting the latest fully translated version is
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7186820/Monster_Girl_Quest_1_amp_2_English_100__Translated

We should see the untranslated Japanese version  of part 3 pop up soon...  but it will be uploaded by a fan, not a spam site."
