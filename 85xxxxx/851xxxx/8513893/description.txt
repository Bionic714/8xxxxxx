Joe Danger 2: The Movie is a racing and platform video game for the PlayStation 3,[3] Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It is the second title by British independent developer Hello Games.[4] According to Hello Games's managing director, it is "kind of" a sequel to the successful Joe Danger.[6] The game was announced in August 2011[7] and released for Xbox Live Arcade on 14 September 2012,[4] and 9 October 2012 for PlayStation Network.[3]
Plot

Joe has gained favor with a movie director in Hollywood and is brought on to perform all the stunts on set.[8] The movie consists entirely of cliche action stunts and so he must perform chase scenes on mini carts, skis, and police bikes.[8]
Development and marketing

Following the commercial success of Joe Danger, Hello Games began to run job adverts on their website, indicating work on a new project.[9] They began to hire and moved offices towards the end of the year.[10][11] After an announcement on Hello Games' website the week before, Joe Danger: The Movie, as it was then known, was presented for the first time at Gamescom in Cologne in August 2011.[7] The game will have similar gameplay, but will take place on the set of a film about the daredevil;[5] players will complete objectives unique to each level set by a "mysterious director".[12] IGN noted that the premise is a "good excuse" to parody famous scenes from certain films.[13] Murray told Matt Miller of Game Informer that the game is "kind of" a sequel to Joe Danger, but that he envisioned the game as big enough to dwarf the original.[6] He indicated the game will involve "a load of vehicles" in a variety of locales.[14] At the Penny Arcade Expo, the game was presented on both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360, which Stephen Totilo of Kotaku interpreted as a broadening of scope for the studio;[5] a promotional image released with the announcement indicated Hello were unsure of how it would be released.[2] The game was eventually released on 14 September 2012.[4]
