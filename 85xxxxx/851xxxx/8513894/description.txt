Hot off his remix of their single "So Young So High", Dada Life announced ANDYBODY as the first artist signing to their So Much Dada label. ANDYBODY's debut single "The First Bass Is The Deepest" has just been released Today - May 27th. Little is known about ANDYBODY but one thing is certain; "The First Bass Is The Deepest" is far from child's play. Hard electro melodies, screaming synths and a dubstep breakdown adhere to the Rules Of Dada and make for a great first artist release for the label.
