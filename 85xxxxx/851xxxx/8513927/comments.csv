,zophras43,2013-05-27T18:10Z,I'm extremely drunk. Which is how this movie HANGOVER should be seen (or hungover). Who gives a fuck about resolution?
,drcat123,2013-05-27T18:25Z,I'm not totally sure if it was this file but my mcafee found a virus after downloading this file and this was only thing I downloaded today. So run a scan just to be safe

looks like it was capped with a cellphone.  image is square so 2 thirds of the screen is missing. 

@bigrg23  how can u tweek it so that 2 thirds of the screen isnt cut off?  shut up u dumbass.  uploaders of this crap should be ashamed of themselves"
,lapis22,2013-05-27T20:36Z,@weboooo0  isnt not complaining its a WARNING. DOWNLOADING THIS IS A WAST OF TIME.  some people have limited bandwidth per month and they should know this is utter crap and not worth getting.
,1EdgyGuy,2013-05-27T21:48Z,"is it scary to cam a movie at a theater ?
""YES I Suppose so"" Thank You for you're effort."

,bcormi,2013-05-28T01:58Z,yeah it sucks....2/3rds of screen missing but still watchable kind of. dont expect much but this all there is right now. thanks anyway
,Kapri25,2013-05-28T02:51Z,"It is amazing in how people do not realize that when something is labeled ""CAM"" they do not realize the person who got this movie was sitting his or her ass in a movie theater with a little video camera and then somehow expect blu-ray or dvd quality from said video camera. It also amazes me for something no one has paid for that they still want to complain. It is one thing to give your opinion on quality...it is another to bitch about it and bad mouth that UL becuase you do not get what you want.

@Scene4all: Thanks for all the stuff you bring us. Please ignore all the whiny bitches."
,drcat123,2013-05-28T05:16Z,it is not as bad as other people say it is for sure. I have seen alot worse on here
,nullroute,2013-05-28T05:42Z,It's 2013 and people still have shitty cameras?
,Sh0ckerElite,2013-05-28T06:15Z,Thanks for your efforts. Haters will shit talk all day cuz they aint got nothing better to do. 
,Captain_Ketchup,2013-05-29T01:38Z,"I can't believe Alan dies. On the bright side, that makes the chances of a Hangover 4 a lot less likely, this movie sucked"
,Newb787,2013-05-29T06:34Z,how does the quality compare to Star Trek? I think ST was ok. 
,Newb787,2013-05-29T06:54Z,"yeah, this version is pretty bad. It would be nice to know what camera/cell phone was used. "
,Mescwalrus,2013-05-29T08:55Z,"You all are some fuck nuts.  I cant pay to see this movie right now cause Im so broke from car repairs.  This is watchable and I thank the uploader for it.

,XONi49,2013-05-31T07:19Z,"you know its sad that the past 20 years we have been getting cam copies of movies in the theater and still get people bitchin about the quality

  its a CAM get over it 

if you want quality wait till some one gets a hold of a real DVD screener or its released on dvd  other wise stop your bitchin and go pay for it "
,yohomofo,2013-05-31T23:46Z,"Not sure what all the complaints are about. It's a watchable cam and this early that's all anyone can expect. If the audio is synced, it's watchable. Good job. Thank you.
