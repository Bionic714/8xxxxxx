There are several instances where the camera gets out of focus, especially during the last 30 minutes.  There are some parts where people walk in front of the camera.  Overall, the sound quality is great, the   picture quality is good.

A:9
V:7 (I recommend watching it with the lights out, since it's a very dark movie)"
