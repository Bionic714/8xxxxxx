,SickJoke1,2013-05-27T16:20Z,"Also don't be a lazy idiot, Seed! This is only like 155 mb. Is it that hard?"
,Easipak,2013-05-27T23:01Z,"Couple of hours in and it just won't download (0,0%)... Did you use good trackers? Or is your connection a little slow perhaps?"
,SickJoke1,2013-05-28T07:23Z,"too much leechers, ill reupload"
,Easipak,2013-05-29T23:17Z,"2 days in, and no one has even 0,1% completed. All download flags are down.  If this is your idea of a sick joke, then well done."

,soeldner95,2013-06-01T11:23Z,"well i got this torrent, will seed with 1mb for u guys"
