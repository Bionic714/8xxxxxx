,thorkis420,2013-05-28T02:28Z,1920*800 IS NOT 1080p!
,goblinshark,2013-05-28T03:10Z,"@thorkis420, it's been covered numerous times that 1920x800 will be more detailed and efficient than 1920x1080. Now if you'd like to argue with established fact and encode/upload your own videos that waste bandwidth and hard drive space by incorporating black bars into the video, be my guest"
,pro346pro,2013-05-28T06:34Z,@thorkis your a complete fuckwit I'm guessing your a mouthbreather haven't figured out the other way to breathe? 1920*800 is the same as 1080p its just had the black bars cropped not all movies have the same aspect! Only16.9 movies would have 1920*1080 ! Educate yourself and this goes for all the other fuckheads
,thorkis420,2013-05-28T20:42Z,"Any display device that advertises 1080p typically refers to the ability to accept 1080p signals in native resolution format, which means there are a true 1920 pixels in width and 1080 pixels in height, and the display is not overscanning, underscanning, or reinterpreting the signal to a lower resolution. The HD ready 1080p logo program, by DIGITALEUROPE, requires that certified TV sets support 1080p 24fps, 1080p 50fps, and 1080p 60fps formats, among other requirements, with fps defined as frames per second.
It is one of the more universally accepted video standards.[3]
For live broadcast applications, a high-definition progressive scan format operating at 1080p at 50 or 60 frames per second is currently being evaluated as a future standard for moving picture acquisition.[4][5] EBU has been endorsing 1080p50 as a future-proof production format because it improves resolution and requires no deinterlacing, allows broadcasting of standard 1080i25 and 720p50 signal alongside 1080p50 even in the current infrastructure and is compatible with DCI distribution formats.[6][7]
1080p50/p60 production format will require a whole new range of studio equipment including cameras, storage and editing systems,[8] and contribution links (such as Dual-link HD-SDI and 3G-SDI) as it has doubled the data rate of current 50 or 60 fields interlaced 1920×1080 from 1.485 Gbit/s to nominally 3 Gbit/s using uncompressed RGB encoding. Most current revisions of SMPTE 274M and EBU Tech 3299 require YCbCr color space and 4:2:2 chroma subsampling for transmitting 1080p50 (nominally 2.08 Gbit/s) and 1080p60 signal.
Recent studies show that for digital broadcasts compressed with H.264/AVC, transmission bandwidth savings of interlaced video over fully progressive video are minimal even when using twice the frame rate, i.e., 1080p50 signal (50 progressive frames per second) actually produces the same bit rate as 1080i50 signal (25 interlaced frames or 50 sub-fields per second).[6][7][9]


Straight off Wiki. by going 1080 by 800 you are ADDING BARS. Get Rid of THem"
,thorkis420,2013-05-28T20:43Z,pro346pro you are wasting your time. No one reads you dumbass comments with all that negative crap in it.
,thorkis420,2013-05-28T20:47Z,"The display resolution of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. It can be an ambiguous term especially as the displayed resolution is controlled by different factors in cathode ray tube (CRT), Flat panel display which includes Liquid crystal displays, or projection displays using fixed picture-element (pixel) arrays.
It is usually quoted as width × height, with the units in pixels: for example, ""1024 × 768"" means the width is 1024 pixels and the height is 768 pixels. This example would normally be spoken as ""ten twenty-four by seven sixty-eight"" or ""ten twenty-four by seven six eight"".
One use of the term “display resolution” applies to fixed-pixel-array displays such as plasma display panels (PDPs), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), digital light processing (DLP) projectors, or similar technologies, and is simply the physical number of columns and rows of pixels creating the display (e.g., 1920 × 1080). A consequence of having a fixed-grid display is that, for multi-format video inputs, all displays need a ""scaling engine"" (a digital video processor that includes a memory array) to match the incoming picture format to the display.
Note that for broadcast television standards the use of the word resolution here is a misnomer, though common. The term “display resolution” is usually used to mean pixel dimensions, the number of pixels in each dimension (e.g., 1920 × 1080), which does not tell anything about the pixel density of the display on which the image is actually formed: broadcast television resolution properly refers to the pixel density, the number of pixels per unit distance or area, not total number of pixels. In digital measurement, the display resolution would be given in pixels per inch. In analog measurement, if the screen is 10 inches high, then the horizontal resolution is measured across a square 10 inches wide. This is typically stated as ""lines horizontal resolution, per picture height;""[1] for example, analog NTSC TVs can typically display about 340 lines of ""per picture height"" horizontal resolution from over-the-air sources, which is equivalent to about 440 total lines of actual picture information from left edge to right edge.[1]"
,thorkis420,2013-05-28T20:47Z,"Some commentators also use display resolution to indicate a range of input formats that the display's input electronics will accept and often include formats greater than the screen's native grid size even though they have to be down-scaled to match the screen's parameters (e.g., accepting a 1920 × 1080 input on a display with a native 1366 × 768 pixel array). In the case of television inputs, many manufacturers will take the input and zoom it out to ""overscan"" the display by as much as 5% so input resolution is not necessarily display resolution.
The eye's perception of display resolution can be affected by a number of factors – see image resolution and optical resolution. One factor is the display screen's rectangular shape, which is expressed as the ratio of the physical picture width to the physical picture height. This is known as the aspect ratio. A screen's physical aspect ratio and the individual pixels' aspect ratio may not necessarily be the same. An array of 1280 × 720 on a 16:9 display has square pixels, but an array of 1024 × 768 on a 16:9 display has rectangular pixels.
An example of pixel shape affecting ""resolution"" or perceived sharpness: displaying more information in a smaller area using a higher resolution makes the image much clearer or ""sharper"". However, most recent screen technologies are fixed at a certain resolution; making the resolution lower on these kinds of screens will greatly decrease sharpness, as an interpolation process is used to ""fix"" the non-native resolution input into the display's native resolution output.
While some CRT-based displays may use digital video processing that involves image scaling using memory arrays, ultimately ""display resolution"" in CRT-type displays is affected by different parameters such as spot size and focus, astigmatic effects in the display corners, the color phosphor pitch shadow mask (such as Trinitron) in color displays, and the video bandwidth."
,thorkis420,2013-05-28T20:49Z,By going 1920 by 800 you are using LESS lines of pixels. Less information. Not More. goblinshark explain how that equates or point me to where they have proven it.
,pro346pro,2013-05-29T01:05Z,Cutting and pasting crap I see! Do you think all movies are filmed to fill the entire screen! No when you go to a cinema you see the movie as it was filmed...that's why we black bars we watch on a TV that's how its filmed! Them black bars are simply cropped from the resolution so no bitrate is wasted on encoding them! The TV makes the black bars by itself
,pro346pro,2013-05-29T01:15Z,"No one is adding bars you clown get the retail bluray and guess what you see the bars! That's how the filmmaker choose to film it! In widescreen I'll say this again most cinematic movie are filmed this way only some are going to fill the full screen!  Its called aspect ratio Google it, if you don't like black bars blame the film makers! Do you think every movie is shot in exactly the same way just to fill your TV screen! "
,oldtimer48,2013-05-29T02:12Z,Is this copy in sync anybody? 1273 downloads and no-one bothered to say thanks?
,peglegbiker,2013-05-29T06:38Z,"Wow, thanks for you hard work.  Most of us appreciate what you do"
,module409,2013-05-29T08:50Z,"Yes, it is in sync. Looks and sounds really good, to me. The quality isn't like a 1080p or even 720p 4.36 GB file. Then again, the file size is only 1.23 GB. For such a smaller file size, this 1080p file looks great. I really don't see why anyone would have a problem with it's quality, in general. "
,obvious2me,2013-05-30T08:00Z,"@Thorkis Yes, people do read comments that contain negativity like Pro's. It is nice to know that someone is thinking the same exact thing we all are. 

People do not read the retarded copy paste that you posted though. :)

It's 1080p. DEAL WITH IT.

To everyone else: It's a great copy. For future reference if you see YIFY{Green Skull} click get, no point in reading comments on his uploads unless you're looking for a laugh."
,pro346pro,2013-05-31T00:44Z,Negative I'm not the one posting on every upload saying its not 1080p when it is!
,aiigghht,2013-05-31T07:43Z,"Thanks YIFY

@thorkis420, Howdee mate. You posted a lot of info there but none of it is relevant to the resolution movies are filmed in, I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm just offering you some info because you're mistaken about the resolution of this video. If you would like to learn more start by googling ""aspect ratio""

1920 x 1080 is 16:9 like just about every TV these days. A lot of movies aren't filmed in 16:9 ratio they're often widescreen (2.35:1) which is why the pixel height is actually lower than 1080 when viewed on a 16:9 screen.

The 800 pixel height just doesn't include the black bars that appear above and below the video on a 16:9 screen, YIFY was kind enough to encode the file without them to save us space on our HDD's and time/bandwidth downloading it.

I hope that's helpful. 

Thanks again YIFY"
