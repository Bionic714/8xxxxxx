,d-w-d,2013-05-31T22:25Z,"no idea why people praise YIFY rips. the video quality on all their rips look like low-bitrate xvid. it's anything but ""10"" - rather just gritty and full of artifacts as soon as anything on the screen moves. it's almost as if they are using a crappy h.264 encoder instead of x264, or just don't know how to use the advanced settings of x264."
,bigshurup,2013-06-03T03:54Z,"dwd you're dumb fuck and your comp is a fucken old junk. dump it, buy a new one to enjoy 10+ quality movies by YIFY. Oh, and STFU!"

Everyone has his own opinion. Don't be an asshole, @ d-w-d just put a comment. 

His comment is like One person love the movie and rate it 9 but some other rate it as only 2.

Control yourself, take care."
