Construction company owner John Matthews learns that
his estranged son, Jason, has been arrested for drug
trafficking. Facing an unjust prison sentence for a
first time offender courtesy of mandatory minimum
sentence laws, Jason has nothing to offer for leniency
in good conscience. Desperately, John convinces the
DEA and the opportunistic DA Joanne Keeghan to let him
go undercover to help make arrests big enough to free
his son in return. With the unwitting help of an ex-con
employee, John enters the narcotics underworld where
every move could be his last in an operation that will
demand all his resources, wits and courage to Survive.
