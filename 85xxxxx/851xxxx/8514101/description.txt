Drawn from our best-selling anthology, The Bedford Introduction to Literature, Literature to Go is a new brief and inexpensive collection of stories, poems, and plays supported by Michael Meyer's incomparable, class-tested instruction. With literature from many periods, cultures, and diverse voices, including today's funniest writers, the book is also a complete guide to close reading, critical thinking, and thoughtful writing about literature. Students discover literature as a diverse, lively, and often humorous reflection of their own lives.
