,drcat123,2013-05-28T06:50Z,lapis22 you need to actually see a cam taken with a cellphone because that is a 1 out of 10 easy. trust me this is actually watchable and full picture. I would say 4 for A and V

,lapis22,2013-05-28T17:32Z,@drcat123 youre an idiot. this was taken with a cell phone and it isnt the full screen all you have to do id look at the resolution to see that.  it was taken with a cellphone and by an idiot who cvouldnt even be bothered to turn thier phone sideways. drcat123 youre delusional.
,drcat123,2013-05-28T18:57Z,lapis22  your a idiot at least on my tv it is full screen. Other cam cell phone movies only have the middle part to them.
