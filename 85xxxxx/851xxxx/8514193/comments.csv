,ArcAngelz,2013-06-08T12:44Z,"@Smith300 Thank you for posting. I was curious about this download since it's posted by an anonymous. I really need the latest version and this seems to be the only one on TPB, but since it's anonymous, I don't think I'll trust it. And even though you had problems after installing it, I'll just not take a risk and not download this. I'd rather wait for a trusted user to post it, and not a coward hiding behind an anonymous name. Even if it does work, I'd rather not support a coward.."
