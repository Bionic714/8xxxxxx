,iambrandoom,2013-05-31T04:08Z,@ajtongurizi i am getting similar issues. disc error issue. the game pass all agbx tests with green and im on mac using iso hacker which the game passed again with all green. the game loads up nice and fine except i can hear the laser in my xbox kinda tripping out reading the disc and once i start career mode bam i get the disc error. ive made three coasters and its getting frustrating. anybody have advice?
,estartithomey,2013-05-31T12:22Z,"@iambrandoom i got same problem keeps saying authification error. tryde few different uploads, and all the same. even used diferent brand dvd verbatin and 2 others all do the same. onley grid2 got this problem. any sulutions?"
,iambrandoom,2013-05-31T16:42Z,i think this is just a bad upload possibly and that we will have to wait for another person/group to upload this game. i know for sure though im not gonna waist any more discs on this spare release.
,driton1,2013-05-31T18:13Z,Even if you try mp3 trick the same problem again  keeps saying authification error.
,addsl,2013-06-01T01:04Z,"I've LT 2.0 and just patched the ISO with xbox backup creator. When i start the game, it asks to install an update. Should i agree? Thanks."
,xxdocxx,2013-06-01T01:07Z,I used ihas 324 burner latest imageburn verbatim mkm 003 discs. 3hrs gameplay so far with no issues. this is no way a bad upload. 
,estartithomey,2013-06-01T07:44Z,"@xxdocxx
it mite not be a bad download, bud what can be the problem, i tryded burning on different dvd. tryde different download same problem, keeps saying authenfication error during first race. any help"
,xxdocxx,2013-06-01T12:39Z,"@estartithomey. some info would be good. like what method are you using. are you using burnermax firmware with a version b ihas drive or are you just overburning the disc aka truncate method. I always use the method witch was recommended for the burning process. Sometimes these XGD3 discs can cause crazy issues. I know Bioshock infinite caused people some issues as well. but thousands of people have downloaded this and only a few people are having problems. also make sure when you burn a disc don't do anything in the background, no downloading, no web browser open DO NOTHING while burning the disc. Leave some info on what your entire process of burning is and what's happening. I'm sure someone will help. Cheers and good luck"
,estartithomey,2013-06-01T13:51Z,"@xxdocxx

yes i use the truncate mode, nurningspeed x2 and verbatin dvds, i tryde 5 copys, even different uploader. always same problem. onley grid 2 al other games ok including bioshok. weird never had thids problem , got latest firmware of lt"
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-01T15:06Z,"Truncate method has been outdated for well over 1 and a 1/2 years and is ""NOT"" acceptable for XGD3 games. The whole point of XGD3 is it's CIV checks designed for the specific purpose of preventing standard overburn and truncated copies from working. Yes, some XGD3 games work, but only because they aren't utilizing the CIV security fully and this should not be confused with believing that long outdated burning methods are still appropriate. 

So you have two options;
1. - Get a compatible DVD burner and start using either the Burner Max firmware or Burner Max Payload tool.
2. - Get out of the scene.

So long as you choose to keep using rejected burning methods, you WILL continue to experience issues like this."
,xxdocxx,2013-06-01T15:13Z,@estartithomey sorry for all your troubles. ask smallz94 if he got the game working. he uses the truncate method. Do you know what verbatims your using. are they mkm 003 or 001's. I know I used the verbatim UMEDISC-DL1-64 and had issues with the XGD3 games but they work fine with Xgd2 games. again ask smallz94 maybe he can help
,xxdocxx,2013-06-01T15:17Z,"ClipperCigars makes a great point. Really when you think about it for the cost of really one game, you can purchase everything you need. Considering all the free games we get here it only makes sense to use the right tools"
,Justin12421,2013-06-01T15:35Z,Have tried twice on this game and wasted 2 disc with the stifmeister and 1 disc with another SPARE release from someone else. Agreed with anyone else. Bad copy wait for another release that is not SPARE. 
,Justin12421,2013-06-01T15:37Z,Dont listen to clippers and xxdoc they are obviously the same person that owns the same stupid software and probably the same guy who put this crap SPARE release on here. ITS A SCAM
,xxdocxx,2013-06-01T15:57Z,Its A Scam give me all your money for downloading this. LMFAO
,Smallz94,2013-06-01T17:55Z,you matter fact buy the game if you really want it
,addsl,2013-06-01T18:51Z,"HELP: I've LT 2.0 and just patched the ISO with xbox backup creator. When i start the game, it asks to install an update. Should i agree??????"
,estartithomey,2013-06-01T19:24Z,"@ClipperCigars
 i ame waiting for new xbox1 to come out. than gona change mine pc.  dont want to spend money to be changing all over again when new xbox comes out. and all mine other XGD3 work ok, first time with grid 2 i got problems. weird no.downloaded more than 300 games over the years and never had any problems using the truncate method.
and mine other xbox that  playes iso from harddrive works ok with grid2 so mite be mine xbox to old? its already 7 years old"
,iambrandoom,2013-06-02T02:17Z,ok so after i finally got this game to work. i deleted it from my comp and re-downloaded it. i ran it through abgx360 with default settings and got all green. than ran it through x360 iso hacker for mac and also got all green. did the xdg3 hack in that same program and then burned it using memorex dual layer dvd+r.
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-02T08:32Z,"@Justin12421, considering you can't get a working release to work, instead claiming it's bad like a few others around here, I think you are hardly in a position to criticize me.

I burned it one time, and it works fine. But hey, no one listen to me, using free software and following instructions of the people who hacked the system is just a scam. Yup, that must be it.

Or rather, I think that I was able to burn, and am playing the game, and you're NOT says enough. "
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-02T09:08Z,"@estartithomey. And I've downloaded over 500. So? How many games you've downloaded over the years is irrelevant. 

How many of them are XGD3? And of those, how many are fully utilizing the CIV security? You do know that it's not many, right? The majority of releases, even now in 2013, are still using the wave based XGD2 format which do not use CIV. And to repeat my previous comment, not all XGD3 games use CIV either. 

Truncate 'will work', despite being the wrong way, for nearly every game that does not use CIV, so long as the disc has at least enough space to burn all the game data. Most of the XGD3 releases aren't about CIV, but about additional storage space, in which needed game data totals more than the available storage of recordable media. If data is missing, it's missing and the game won't play. This can not be patched at the ISO level. This is why BurnerMax is needed, because it is not simply an overburning firmware, it is a custom write strategy that bumps up track/data density to squeak out extra space so that 100% of game data will fit.

There is some half assed XGD3 hack bullshit that patches to the older LT2.0 standards, but again, this ain't going to help for CIV security or game data size issues. That's purely for people who won't update their Xboxes to LT3.0, which is a whole different issue all together.

Anywho, I'm simply repeating the burning instructions as per C4E, the person who made LT firmware. The same instructions I follow with 100% 1 disc, 1 burn, 1 playable game success.

Personally, I find it annoying and counter productive that you'll use his firmware on your 360 so you can play these games, but won't listen to what he has to say about how to burn the games so they will work with his firmware. I mean, really?

So whatever, do what you want. But if you're not going to follow the burning instructions that the LT firmware requires, then don't bitch and moan about shit not working or throw around misinformed BS that the image must be the problem. "
,estartithomey,2013-06-02T12:38Z,"@clippercigars
1 i never sad it was bad download. i just stated i got  problems with the burning, i now i ame using truncate. and some games got problems with it. so i never  throw around misinformed BS that the image must be the problem.i ask for help thats it. and dont worry i got game working on other xbox thasts plays them directley from harddrive. so chil ok, i apreciate the help bus dont want to be slaged of for nothing"
,estartithomey,2013-06-02T12:41Z,"@clipperCigars
and yes i got loads of xgd3 games and all work including bioshock . i got told that aswel got  CIV security. so prob the burning method bud all other xgd3 works ok."
,iambrandoom,2013-06-03T02:02Z,"so i thought i got this game working and i was wrong. the game still either says ""unable to authorize disc"" or ""disc error: unable to read disc"" "
,iambrandoom,2013-06-03T04:29Z,Has anybody successfully got this game to burn and work on a Mac? Any help would be much appreciated!
,JonAndRoid,2013-06-03T16:39Z,"so i have ihas and mkm003's, getting failed to authorize disk...not too sure why...burned over 100 games and this is the first....not too sure whats going on. installed to hdd and it went away...i read here about new security measures or something...offering some insight to those in need of help..."
