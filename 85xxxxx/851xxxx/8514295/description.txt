  The wait for Franz FerdinandΓÇÖs fourth album is stretching into ΓÇÿChinese DemocracyΓÇÖ territory, but if arch lyrics and louche vocals are what youΓÇÖre missing then let this fill the gap. As their name implies, Filthy Boy are a smutty proposition. These boys have supported Palma Violets, received the Zane Lowe seal of approval and garnered praise no end from the likes of NME, The Fly and TimeOut London. This foursome are leading a new revolution of indie disco, with a post-noughties twist. Helmed by 20-year-old frontman Paraic Morrissey and his transportive baritone (like Kapranos, singer Paraic Morrissey has the knack of sounding like heΓÇÖs casually sparking up a post-coital cigarette, but thereΓÇÖs less of a pop cushion here than with Franz.) Filthy Boy's debut album, which was recorded at Edwyn Collins' West Heath Studio, is laced with romance, sweetness and intrigue. Stories don't quite finish as expected, there's drama, suggestion and blurred boundaries between innocence and murky darkness.
The Peckham boys, their number made up by Paraic's bass-playing brother Michael, guitarist Harry Weskin and drummer Ed Bernez, spent less than a week recording an opening statement that's as barbed as it is pleasant. Steeped in refreshing, classic-leaning guitar lines, melody and sticky, robust choruses, it acts as an imposing calling card for its creators' songwriting abilities. "Naughty Corner" is like Sweeney Todd down the indie disco, while "Spiral Eyes" has a dark heart plucked straight from the Nick Cave School Of Indecency. 

  'Smile That WonΓÇÖt Go Down', above everything, showcases the memorable and incredible vocals of Paraic. Even the most absurd or mundane of lyrics in the almost-parody track "Jimmy Jammies", make you fall to your figurative knees in awe of the band, when set to the deep baritone voice of Morrissey. Filthy Boy have no time for beating-about-the-bush with this album. They write and sing exactly what they mean, and make no apologies for their frank lyrics. In "That Life" we can see, in full force, the bandΓÇÖs penchant for colourful lyrics (ΓÇÿphenomenal tits and the firmest behindΓÇÖ) that gives their music an almost juvenile charm. Last year, the band grabbed the attention when they released their single "Naughty Corner" along with a video racy enough to make your Granny shudder! All in all, it's pretty pleasantly disgusting!
