This is the Amercian version aka The Blood Of Heroes cut. The extended or uncut version is called The Salute Of The Jugger. The only real difference is the ending. I like this dvd because the colors are easier to see. The other Salute Of The Jugger and dvd is darker. Also, the audio is the highest you will get at 448 kbps.

I am looking for someone to remux the blu ray version if you have it! big thanks! please help if you can, I need that blu ray for film research.
