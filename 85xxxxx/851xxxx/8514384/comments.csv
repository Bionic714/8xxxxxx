,theglikspokmentipler,2013-05-28T00:26Z,Is anyone else stuck at 50%? There are 213 seeds and I have been able to connect to one. Seems a bit weird.

,Garyhall,2013-05-28T00:54Z,"Classic case of too many leachers and grabbers that don't seed. If you going to download people, then at least SEED!"
,Garyhall,2013-05-28T04:30Z,"I show over 230 seeders.
I don't know why it only shows a few seeders..."
,keanereader,2013-05-28T17:26Z,"Gaaah, where's the seeding. Stuck at 93.8%!"
,magz64,2013-05-29T03:09Z,stuck at 93 % too :(
