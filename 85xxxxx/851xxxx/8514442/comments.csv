,misterburnz,2013-05-29T18:00Z,"Morons that prefer to skip scrolling through 87 some odd folders, extracting them, and then coming to the conclusion that the same files are present either way. That method is old and is left somewhere between demonoid and kazaa. 

Solution for _woah_ : Ok simply download this/any torrent by a trusted uploader. Notice the two files.. go ahead and ZIP them in any specific fashion you prefer.. 10 files, 1000, or 9999956 if you want to be ""extra"" safe. Then Extract as normal. Tada!"
