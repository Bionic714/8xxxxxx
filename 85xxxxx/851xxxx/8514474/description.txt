From the Label "Cleopatra", comes the 4 disc compilation of "Industrial Madness". Contains artists such as Le√¶ther Strip, Project Pitchfork, Razed In Black, and more (in high quality mp3 format).

Notes from Discog http://www.discogs.com/Various-Industrial-Madness/release/445019
-------------------------------------------------


The fourth CD is a random pick from the Cleopatra back catalog. The back tray inlay is replaced with a generic one saying "Bonus Free Surprize CD".

Track 1.01 is misspelled on the label as "Die Lieb".

This compilation comes in a cardstock box/case.

XERN0N'S NOTE: The torrent contains the 3 discs of the compilation, but excludes the 4th disc I received, since it is a "random pick", and therefore, should not be defined as "the inclusion" of this torrent.
