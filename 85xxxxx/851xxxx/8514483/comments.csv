TO dumb fucks who ask if it's working, TRY MOVE YOUR FAT LAZY HAND... GUIDE THE MOUSE POINTER OVER THE GREEN SKULL BEHIND UPLOADERS NAME... AND 3 LETTERS POP UP: VIP so IT WORKS...  And at last, at least :-) Thank you Drarbg for this, been waiting to stomp the gas again :-)"

,S1NCORP,2013-05-31T07:01Z,"If your getting a disc read error just copy the game to the internal HDD and update and play simple as that.  As for the game...  if your a fan of the original Racedriver GRID be prepared to be disappointed by GRID 2's arcade like handling and lack of car upgrades, lacklustre race modes and worst of all NO FREESTYLE DRIFT Aargh!!! >:-/"
,Persia514,2013-06-01T00:05Z,"finally done downloading it ! and game is working on Rogero 4.40 v1.03  ...
