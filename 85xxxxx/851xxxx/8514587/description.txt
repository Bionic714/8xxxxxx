Plot

Mary Katherine (a.k.a. M.K.) (Amanda Seyfried), a near-20s teenager, visits her estranged and eccentric scientist father, Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis), who has been searching for tiny human soldiers, about which M.K. is skeptical. She wants her father to stop his work. Unknown to the both of them, Bomba is right that there are tiny soldiers called Leafmen. They protect the forest Bomba lives near from evil creatures called Boggans, who shoot arrows that can kill any living thing, and their malevolent leader, Mandrake (Christoph Waltz), who plans to destroy the forest. An independent young soldier, Nod (Josh Hutcherson) decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leafmen leader, Ronin (Colin Farrell), who wants Nod to learn about teamwork.

The queen of the forest, Queen Tara (Beyonc√© Knowles), decides to choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods, guarded by a laid-back slug named Mub (Aziz Ansari) and an uptight snail named Grub (Chris O'Dowd), who wants to become a leaf man, to use her magic to tell her whom to choose. When she chooses, the Boggans attack. In the midst of the attack, Mandrake's son and lead general, Dagda (Blake Anderson), is killed by Ronin, but Tara is shot by Mandrake.
