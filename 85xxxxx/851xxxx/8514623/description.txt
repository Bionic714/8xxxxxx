In THE LANGUAGE GOD TALKS, Herman Wouk attempts to reconcile the sparring ideas of science and religion. Drawing on his own experiences and encounters with the masters of religion and science, such as Richard Feynman, Murray Gell-Mann, and Steven Weinberg, he addresses the eternal questions of why we are here, what purpose faith serves, and how scientific belief and fact fit into the picture.

In his classic graceful prose, Wouk introduces readers to figures of the 20th century who have had key roles in the arguments about science versus religion. Spanning an incredible breadth of time and illustrated with Wouk's own personal experiences, THE LANGUAGE GOD TALKS is a brilliant investigation and a worthy addition to the canon.
