,torrentic,2013-05-28T19:40Z,"Thanks a lot for sharing, cyclonoid!!

I've followed install.notes.txt in Windows 8 x64
and it installed successfully.

One only note:
in the PS, where it says:
""P.S. Run Nero Control Center
Delete exists serial number and add new""
don't use the serial in there, but the 3rd serial, from step 3."
,PattyrRob,2013-05-28T19:40Z,I downloaded this and it does not have platinumeffects12 application in it. As far as your screenshots thats only because you installed a platinum serial. Just my opinion. Don't mean to step on anybody's toes.
,PattyrRob,2013-05-28T19:53Z,My mistake cyclonoid and TPB ppl. Nero's Platinum trial from there site has same hash as this one. My appoligies cyclonoid. I will seed this for some time.
,torrentic,2013-05-28T20:28Z,"Please ignore my previous post about the PS. Sorry.
By mistake I thought that they were different .

It works 100% great. Thanks once more, cyclonoid."
,ambergrl29,2013-05-29T18:18Z,Cyclonoid I tried to install and it says it expired after entering serial #. What am I doing wrong?
,ambergrl29,2013-05-29T18:41Z,cyclonoid I tried to install and after serial # it says sorry your version has expired. What am i doing wrong???????

,akatsuki1416,2013-05-30T14:53Z,Thanks for the upload.. :D
,viruta48,2013-06-03T13:38Z,"Funciona perfectamente! Gracias!

,jimis88,2013-06-04T13:45Z,serial number doesn't work!!!!
,jimis88,2013-06-08T12:30Z,"To make this password WORK, change the date of your computer backwards before 2013. e,g, September 2012 will work! After that, you﻿ can put your computer, back to it's original date, without any problem. Enjoy! :D"
,Supermatt01,2013-06-10T07:23Z,This doesn't work either. Not one of these Nero uploads will work. The stupid patcher won't work at all. In every file that has an .exe it says the same dumb thing and then I have to close the patcher. It is no good. I have followed the instructions to the letter four times with the same results and as it was truly said insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results.
,Supermatt01,2013-06-10T07:39Z,Ok now you guys have to work on writing your instructions up so people can understand them plainly. It is not rocket science. You install the Nero product and then you install the x86 or 64 reg key then you change the install key to the second key that doesn't expire EVER and it is now unlocked. The patcher thing is useless. 
,Demonaz77,2013-06-13T20:55Z,Thanks @cyclonoid & @Supermatt01!!!
