,IcemanSR,2013-05-27T23:08Z,"unfortunatelly this update is screwed up
my fps is steady at 60 and then a sec later drops to 47 then climb up,and every 2 seconds it drops again.reverting previous patch and its working good again"
,IcemanSR,2013-05-27T23:19Z,"Found the problem!
DO NOT USE steam_api.dll FROM THIS RELEASE!
Only use their exe for game!
updates will still be in game
The STEAM DLL kills fps in game as i mentioned in previous post!"
,Timbo6669,2013-05-28T01:09Z,doubt it..
,IcemanSR,2013-05-28T03:17Z,"i dont know what u are doubting
and i dont care really steam dll from this is screwed up totaly"
,4nt1trt,2013-05-28T14:12Z,"IcemanSR you mean it will kill fps on same graphic settings before installing update?
Did you check vsync after install?"
,WonderPirate24,2013-05-28T23:34Z,"Hay! Can't find a description about this Update
on the steam website or anywhere. I follow the
""http://store.steampowered.com/app/222480"" 
link and found nothing. Can anybody confirm if
this update is for real and does it really work?

,Dewarton,2013-05-30T03:20Z,"=====================================
Added:
 - 2048×1152 and 2560×1080 resolution support

Fixed:
 - ON/OFF toggle for the Mouse Acceleration setting was previously backwards. ON is now actually ON and OFF is OFF.
 =====================================

***IMPORTANT NOTE***
 Please recheck and test mouse acceleration settings after today’s patch. (Hint: set acceleration to ‘OFF’). 

Watch out tho, this release seems to be not good as many ppl have lag-stuttering issues. ye been warned."
