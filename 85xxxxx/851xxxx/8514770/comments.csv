,onlyHD,2013-05-29T10:42Z,"It's great to hear !!

I know how hard it is to download source and encoding them & upload, then seeding.
Besides you are already loaded with huge requests and still you are encouraging requests, it's so kind of you. Actually we should thank you for your effort and time :)"
,Philosophus,2013-05-29T23:24Z,"Thank you for the nice movie. 
Any chance for the movie ""Crazy Heart"" (2009) ?"
,jalucian,2013-05-31T05:10Z,@ onlyHD - Ernest and Celestine is a controversial movie? It doesn't seem to fit with the rest of those on the list...unless there's another Ernest and Celestine that's not about a mouse and a bear. Am I missing something? lol
,onlyHD,2013-05-31T06:12Z,"I don't know how that movie got here lol :)
"
,onlyHD,2013-06-01T17:16Z,"Now i get it.
