NASCAR 2013 Sprint Cup Series Race #12 Charlotte The Coca~Cola 600  



This file has issues with the audio. It doubles until about lap 100, fixes itself, goes back to double until the next break and I am pretty sure it is fine after about lap 127. It's annoying but better then nothing. Also the file type is Flv but plays with VLC and WDTV players.
