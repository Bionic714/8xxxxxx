Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the special Memorial Day edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex Jones speaks with former presidential nominee of the Constitution Party, co-author of Romans 13: The True Meaning of Submission and To Keep Or Not To Keep and pastor of Liberty Fellowship in Kalispell, Montana Chuck Baldwin about preacher's rights to political opinions under the First Amendment. 

We'll also air our interview with senior editor of The New American William F. Jasper where we examined the John Birch Society's origins, and broke down their incredible foresight in exposing the American Communist takeover. 

And special guest host Gerald Celente, American trend forecaster and publisher of the Trends Journal, takes over for the final hour providing his unique perspective on the spectacle that is the White House Correspondent's Dinner, the war drums beating in Syria and a host of other news items.

Today's broadcast consists of previously aired material.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
