'Cos the others I've tried are REALLY bad."

,tflagger997,2013-05-29T16:15Z,"Missed this one (the other 5 or 6 copies were posted long before this one)-

Taking a 720p and downgrading to 320p is lame. Nice about CM8 doing the lipsync, too bad this is the same original cam video with blurred watermark that is only 720x320. Also the colors are very over-saturated. "
