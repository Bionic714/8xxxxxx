,Fuebar,2013-05-28T03:40Z,"This isn't a tweak... Google GodMode and the first link'll show you how to do it.

For the lazy: Make a new folder and rename it to GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

Then hit enter, so the rename is confirmed. The folder'll turn into a GodMode folder with all the tweaks. This torrent is just that folder in a zip file to be extracted."
