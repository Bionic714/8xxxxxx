DESCRIPTION:

Produce submission-ready manuscripts and screenplays

Storyist provides the word processing tools you expect from a top-notch creative writing application, including spell checking; smart quotes processing; annotations; and support for headers, footers, and style sheets. And Storyist comes with manuscript and screenplay templates so you can focus on the writing, not the formatting.

Get a high-level view of your story

The story development tools in Storyist let you sketch out a story using index cards and photographs and then refine it with customizable plot, character, and setting sheets. If you prefer a more traditional approach, Storyist provides an outliner for working with your story elements in outline form.

Keep all your writing organized and accessible

The project view organizes your novel manuscripts, screenplays, notes, and other project-related writing so you can access them with a click of the mouse. And the search field lets you quickly find what you are looking for anywhere in your project and return to your writing.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Pretty easy, actually. Mount the .dmg, drag to Applications (or wherever you want it), run it, copy/paste the included serial.

DO NOT UPDATE OR YOU WILL HAVE TO REINSTALL!!!!!
