Richard Lemieuvre's wife (Nicole Segaud) leaves town temporarily. He meets a blonde tourist (Ulrike Lary) by a fountain and they go off and have various sexual adventures, including in the Bois de Boulogne with a hooker or two (Laura Clair and Nadine Roussial), a nightclub (with stripper Cathy Stewart), with a friend of Richard Lemieuvre and his wife (Anne Veruska), in a restaurant (with waiter Dominique Aveline), at Richard Lemieuvre's apartment with a swinging couple (Guy Royer and Jane Baker). There is a penultimate gang bang scene, involving many of the previous participants, where France Lomay plays a maid (non-sex). Finally the wife returns and it turns out she knows the little stranger.
