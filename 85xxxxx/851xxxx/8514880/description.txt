RICHARD WAGNER - The "Ring" Without Words (assembled and conducted by Lorin Maazel)
Performed by the Berlin Philharmonic

Telarc CD (1988)

A decent attempt to tell the entire story of the Ring in Wagner's own music (not words). Differs from traditional "orchestral highlights" for this reason, it's continuous music from beginning to end.

The audio quality and the performance are both superb. The only real weak point is the concept and/or Maazel's execution of it, but that is arguable. Many people like it, some don't.
