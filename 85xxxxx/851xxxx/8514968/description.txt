The book is lavishly illustrated with more than eighty of Escher's work on show and, to indicate the extent to which he was influenced by mathematical ideas, one only has to consider the titles given to some of the works ...The whole book is a visual delight. Most of the articles are very readable and they constitute a very wide range of insights into Escher's world.
