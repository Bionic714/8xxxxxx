Only video playback works but no sound when trying to playback videots folder from hard drive. One has to select video as a playlist to get sound but then half of the pan scan options don't work. Gone back to windvd 2010 just to get some joy out of movies again. Anyways, thanks for all your effort wolf."

,roccococo82,2013-06-01T21:05Z,Unfortunately doesnt work proper :(
,chop007,2013-06-08T15:40Z,"I am almost certain that when the trial runs out, it automatically uninstalls some .dll in syswow 64. Have tried almost everything but it refuses to play the sound part of a video_ts. Unless you go to videos and select playlist, then it plays fine, but not the dvd structure as such.i.e Video_TS, .VOB etc etc."
,chop007,2013-06-08T15:41Z,Strange that powerdvd 10 has almost the same quality.
