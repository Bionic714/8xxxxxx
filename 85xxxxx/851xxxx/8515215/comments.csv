,chem_101,2013-05-29T10:49Z,Is there missing commentary on the audio file for the race?
,SilverKnife,2013-05-30T06:29Z,"Thanks man! But can I ask you, what software are ou using? Or maybe you would make video whith 3500 b/ps & 25 fps, because all my attempts failed."
,shpritzer,2013-05-30T17:29Z,I'm i the only one noticing that the commentary is in Russian??
,SilverKnife,2013-05-30T19:38Z,Ha-ha... no not only... I can recomend you mkvmerge... load this video & delete all audio that you don't need. That is easy and quick.
