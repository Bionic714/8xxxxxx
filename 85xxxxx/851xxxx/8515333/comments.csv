This is correct.  There is no mistake.  The source file from Audible is one file.  After the amount of time it took to remove the DRM, I wasn't too terribly motivated to ""chapter"" it.  I hope you can all find it in your bleeding pirate hearts to forgive me.  :)

As for the reader, Alice Eve, I have to agree with ""lookfar.""   She's not as good as Zach Quinto was in the first book.   It helps to stare at a picture of her tits while you listen. :-)"

So glad it sounds good for you guys out there, too.  I thought it would be a shame to convert an enhanced audio file to anything less than 64 kbps.  And for this presentation type, stereo would be a complete waste of space.  Mono is more than enough.
...and staring at her tits while listening to the book?!  Good tip... both of them.  lol  Excellent recommendation by the way!  Everyone, heed those words.  :)
