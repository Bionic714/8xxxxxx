,RossPat,2013-05-28T11:35Z,"Never gets started, always getting metadata."
,Nimh,2013-05-28T16:13Z,"Yeah same, it doesn't start, just removed it from my utorrent as it had been sitting there for 5 hours. 

 Anyway,  thanks for keeping us updated with Judy. With all the crap on TV i'm amazed it's this hard to actually watch/find JJ online."
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-28T16:19Z,"hello tvteam open the damn dl,
y have 100s of dls worthless if u dont seed
any."
,keeganzo,2013-05-28T18:26Z,TVTeam needs to lose the green skull
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-28T20:33Z,"i wonder why he or it has one? he always or it,, is copying from another,nothing new from them,it or he always from another."
,gnorpppp,2013-05-28T23:04Z,Thank you so much! :)
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-28T23:49Z,WTF u r thanking ?
,spacemancalvin,2013-05-29T01:08Z,Why even post this if you won't let people seed? Cocksucker.
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-29T17:48Z,"In my opinion people should not download anything from tv team,it is always very slow no seed and u can find all their ups with other guys much faster,TVTEAM just copy from others"
,ghdsd,2013-05-29T22:53Z,I miss Mr2Wingzzz!!!!!!
,azybuzza,2013-05-30T01:39Z,"Even though I gotta call bullshit on the seeding of this one so far, I think we are getting high demands. People are doing us a favour by sharing at all.

@TWEETY2455
If u can find it elsewhere, maybe u can just download it from there - and maybe even share it with others instead of whining like a little bitch. Maybe a bit of put up or shut up would be in order?"
,spacemancalvin,2013-05-30T02:53Z,"@azybuzza I'm not defending tweety more just saying you're retarded.....

If tweety was asking for an episode that wasn't here (ex. ep249) already then started bitching at tvteam for not being quick enough or something to that avail then sure I understand saying tweety's a little bitch.

However tvteam posted this online then refuses to seed it to anyone - from the start. No one asked him to put this up, he did it based on his own free will. So if you're going to put it up then refuse people expect some backlash.

In conclusion, you are the bitch less you ever forget - you should just shut the fuck up or stick a dick in your mouth because that's clearly why you opened your mouth."
,ghdsd,2013-05-30T03:36Z,"Come on guys, give TVTeam a break here.  I'm sure something just went wrong and we just need to live with the fact you got what you paid for here which was nothing.
I'm DL'ing MasterChef from a TVTeam U/L as I type, and as usual, it's going fine.
Pull up your big boy pants, be thankful you can even get files like this, and when something goes wrong, give your blood pressure a break and move on.  Sheesh ...."
,spacemancalvin,2013-05-30T04:00Z,"@ghdsd  Sure I hear ya,but this isn't an anomaly with tvteam and Judge Judy though...  I miss mr2wingz that guy/girl was a boss and always kept everything proper.

Also you imply that were mad... I don't want to sound mad... I feel marvelous. Just because you accept mediocrity doesn't mean we have to."
,azybuzza,2013-05-30T05:45Z,"@spacemancalvin

You seem to need to relax, so if you think I need a cock in my mouth maybe I should go gay and suck you off so you'll quit being an ass.

As far as me putting the ""whining like a little bitch"" in there, that might have been the wrong choice of words from me...maybe."
,azybuzza,2013-05-30T05:49Z,Forgot to say that I gotta agree with what people are saying about mr2wingz. That guy was stellar.
,keeganzo,2013-05-30T06:08Z,MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ MR2WINGZ 
,Pendaws,2013-05-30T06:29Z,"I must say that this is a little disappointing but, that's life. I also miss Wingz but he must have had problems getting JJ and TV Team stepped in.
I don't see them need to go troppo and swear about TV Team, he isn't getting paid to do this?"
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-30T14:28Z,"azybuzza why dont u go suk the dik of ur father?
I comment on shit ups whenever i feel like u gay.

Shit is shit not gold u fuck."
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-30T14:42Z,"I dont have nothing personally  against TVTEAM,i just find stupid having 200 of the same ups where TVTEAM has always the less seeders and saying divide the people around so we stay longer wasting . "
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-31T18:12Z,wtf this crap is still doing  here?
,rekrap,2013-06-01T04:38Z,"It's seeding, but extremely slow, at average 0.3 kb/s.  I am at 89.2% now.  3 more days to go."
,ghdsd,2013-06-02T03:22Z,"@rekrap - I said the same thing ... 4 days ago.  I'm still at 89.2% now.  I think it's a government plot to get folks to sit on a DL long enough for the feds t record ISP's for a bid copyright infringement lawsuit, or maybe JJ herself looking for a big John Doe lawsuit against freeloaders ... I bailed a long time ago."
,rekrap,2013-06-02T05:44Z,I'm out then!
,azybuzza,2013-06-02T10:39Z,"@TWEETY2455

yeah, sorry about that. no need to have a go at you. Foi Mau"
