,dootiefresh,2013-05-30T08:14Z,Thanks for all of your uploads!  I use sickbeard to download my fav TV shows and the TVdatabase sees this show as the 2nd season of Breaking Amish.  So sickbread does not auto download since they are labeled S01E##.  If possible changing the torrent label to S02E## would be greatly appreciated and fix the issue for any users with this set-up
