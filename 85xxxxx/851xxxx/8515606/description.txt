 The TG12413 plug-in is an  authentic emulation of the compressor  / limiter  
   from  the legendary  EMI TG12345  mixing console,  which was  used on  many  
   classic recordings such  as The BeatlesÆ  Abbey Road and  Pink FloydÆs Dark  
   Side of the Moon. The TG12345 consoles were custom-built for EMI's  studios  
   and were never sold commercially.   
              
   The  plug-in  brings  the  sound of  this  rare  and  sought-after unit  to  
   computer-based DAWs and sets a new standard in vintage hardware  modelling.  
   It  functions as  a 2:1  compressor or  as a  limiter with  up to  20dB of  
   limiting and accurately reproduces the behaviour of the original. It can be  
   used  on  mono,  stereo  and multi-channel  tracks,  supporting  up  to 7.1  
   surround operation.  
              
   Two plug-in modules are included, providing variations on the TG sound: the  
   æ1969Æ module  is modelled  on the  original from  the EMI  console and the  
   æ2005Æ  module  is based  on  Chandler LimitedÆs  hardware  reissue of  the  
   TG12413, the TG1.
