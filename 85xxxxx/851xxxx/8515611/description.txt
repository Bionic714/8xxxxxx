What's New in Version 1.14

- ADVANCED PLANNING UPDATE: change your pre-planned route without having to start from scratch. You can now change the starting point, destination, or departure time ΓÇô and see how it affects your drive and arrival time.

- KEEP YOUR SETTINGS: If you are using the iCloud backup feature you can now delete the app to free up space when updating. Make sure that iCloud is enabled on your device, then open and close the TomTom app to make a backup. Now delete the app to free up space and download the update from the App Store.

- iPhone 3G and iPod touch 2nd gen. users (and other users of iOS4.x): this is the last version of the TomTom app that will support your device.
