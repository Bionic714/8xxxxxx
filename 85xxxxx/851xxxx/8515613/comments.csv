"
,tflagger997,2013-05-28T06:01Z,Clarification - the initial seeding is so slow it takes 15+ minutes to get the NFO.  My DL speed can do it in less than one second if seeds are there. ;)

Also the audio is good, but does have a noticeable hiss and is only 128 kb."
,acsmith1972,2013-05-29T04:52Z,If Yerisan thinks that's an 8 he must be using a 13 inch color tv from 1978.
,Teachem,2013-05-29T11:43Z,"Are these ratings a TS rating, or General Rating, or a Rating compared to DVD? We just never know out here!"
,tflagger997,2013-05-29T16:26Z,"Average cam ratings (from me).  It is a good point though.  So on the range of camera possibilities this is about a V:6.5 A:6.5. 

A perfect cam, and some have been posted in the past, would have V:10 (perfect VHS quality), and A:10 (good line audio @ 256 Kbps +).

So far we are just getting everyone trying their 'filters' out on the same original video with the blurred watermark, with a little editing to replace the missing parts.  Then they slap their names on it, and upload to the 'main' site where most TPB posters get their material from (apparently).  Then we get 6 copies here, though most are posted so close together time-wise, that they all started at roughly the same time (so it is not spam)."
