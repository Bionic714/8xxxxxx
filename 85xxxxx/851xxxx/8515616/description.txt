The  TG  Mastering Pack  provides  authentic emulations  of  EQ and  filter 
   modules from the original EMI TG12410 transfer console. These consoles were 
   custom-built  for EMI's  studios and  have been  the centrepiece  of Abbey 
   Road's mastering rooms for more than 30 years. 
             
   The TG12410's Tone Control and Filter modules have become secret weapons of 
   Abbey Road's  mastering engineers  and these  were studied  and modelled to 
   create the TG Mastering Pack. The plug-ins bring the smooth, musical  sound 
   of the original TG hardware to users of computer-based audio workstations. 
             
   The TG12412 is a four-band, semi-parametric EQ with selectable  frequencies 
   and curve shapes on each band. The Shape control provides the shelving  and 
   variable  bell curves  from the  original module.  The TG12414  provides a 
   presence section and  low- and high-pass  filters. The presence  section is 
   the same as the presence EQ on the legendary TG12345 mixing console.
