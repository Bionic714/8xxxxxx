On the Underground Comix grading scale this book is far above average on all fronts. Interesting, well-written topics with a good bit of humor. But it really excels in the art department. It's a looker, for sure.

As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!
