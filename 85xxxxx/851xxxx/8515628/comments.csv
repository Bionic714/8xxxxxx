,Justin12421,2013-06-01T15:30Z,I have never wrote a comment but I have wasted 3 disc on this game so I dont want anyone to do the same. As someone else said I would give up on this SPARE release and wait for another. I have tried the other most seeded copy twice and this as well and no dice. Time to give up and wait for another release...
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-02T09:37Z,"@Justin12421, Well, coming from the person who said in the other torrent that using C4E's BurnerMax firmware a scam, it's no wonder you are wasting discs. 

The game works just fine.

C4E, The creator of the LT firmware you run on your x360 to play these games long ago gave a definitive set of instructions of how to properly burn working games compatible with his firmware and provided the resources for doing so for free, as he did with the LT firmware itself.

Sorry you got a shitty burner and discs that aren't compatible and can't burn some XGD3 games correctly and won't spend the $15-20 bucks to get ones that can. That's your own fault and problem to deal with, not the fault of the spare release.

So quit your bitching and spreading bullshit lies about the release. Do the shit right, then you won't have any issues, just like the rest of us who are enjoying the game. "
