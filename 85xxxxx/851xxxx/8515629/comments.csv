try updade your video drivers, direct x last updade, also there is game accelerator youtube it,or torrent, is a great help for old pc, then from catalist center at the gaming performace menu, turn everything on left, try your luck"
,reyasl,2013-05-31T09:30Z,"also net framework 4.0 and the nvidia drivers, even when you dont have nvidia card, will help  some games to avoid crash, gamexp, gameboost will also increase few fps"
