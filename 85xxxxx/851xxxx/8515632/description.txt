Information
------------------------------

Meet the Natives follows a group of men from the South Pacific island of Tanna who travel to the USA - to observe the natives of these exotic lands. From cattle roundups and snowball fights in Montana, these men experience some of the best - and most unusual - activities that the USA has to offer. They provide a unique spin on life in America, filtering what they see through their own experiences and offering their perspective on homelessness, traditional gender roles, livestock artificial insemination, and more.


1)  The Cowboy People 
Five natives of the remote Southern Pacific island of Tanna embark on a journey to America, where they soon learn that farming is motivated by money.

2)  The Big Apple 
The five tribesmen are swept by limo from the Montana cowboys and into the Manhattan apartment of 'Bunny'. From there, they take a baffling trip to Wall Street.

3)  The Suburbans 
Unsure why they are decorating a strange plastic tree, the natives spend Thanksgiving watching teleshopping and going to a Santa parade in a modest suburb in the mid west.

4)  La La Land 
The tribesmen live 'the ideal' in Orange County, relaxing by the pool, observing a Botox party, visiting a theme park and puzzling over the point of artificial grass.

5)  The Army People 
Concluding their trip, the natives head to an army base in Georgia, where they learn more about the heroic American soldier who stopped the infighting on their island.
