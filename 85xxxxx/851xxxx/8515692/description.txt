Her singular skill at creating richly drawn, complex worlds makes her novels not mere whodunits but brilliant and satisfying novels about memory, identity, loss, and what defines us as humans. With Faithful Place, the highly praised third novel about the Dublin Murder squad, French takes readers into the mind of Frank Mackey, the hotheaded mastermind of The Likeness, as he wrestles with his own past and the family, the lover, and the neighborhood he thought he'd left behind for good.

Broken Harbor: Mick "Scorcher" Kennedy, the brash cop from Tana FrenchΓÇÖs bestselling Faithful Place, plays by the book and plays hard. ThatΓÇÖs whatΓÇÖs made him the Murder squadΓÇÖs top detectiveΓÇöand thatΓÇÖs what puts the biggest case of the year into his hands.

On one of the half-built, half-abandoned "luxury" developments that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children are dead. His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care.

At first, Scorcher and his rookie partner, Richie, think itΓÇÖs going to be an easy solve. But too many small things canΓÇÖt be explained. The half dozen baby monitors, their cameras pointing at holes smashed in the SpainsΓÇÖ walls. The files erased from the SpainsΓÇÖ computer. The story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder who was slipping past all the locks.

And Broken Harbor holds memories for Scorcher. Seeing the case on the news sends his sister Dina off the rails again, and sheΓÇÖs resurrecting something that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control: what happened to their family one summer at Broken Harbor, back when they were children.
