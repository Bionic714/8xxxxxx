,mwisher,2013-06-14T07:49Z,Thorburn this is a great share buddy but is there any chance you could turn up your upload speed so that at least one of us could get the full torrent so that we can help seed?  It has been a few weeks now and I think only one other person has managed to get the whole file and they didn't keep seeding. An hour or so at full speed will allow this great upload to being seeding properly. Thanks again for it.
