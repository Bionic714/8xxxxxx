This book is actually still available from Kitchen Sink Press (via Steve Krupp's Curio Shoppe) where they have this to say about it...

The Airships of Atlantis are pretty cool looking and "New Age" philosophies permeated the head shops that underground comix were sold in, so it seemed like a sure bet. Metzger, though a veteran underground cartoonist (including Truckin' and several issues of Moon Dog for Print Mint), had never published a comic with Kitchen Sink Press before. But sales on Mu were poor and the only underground comic title with two letters (unless you count "O.K.") ended up being Metzger's only solo effort for KSP, though he sometimes contributed to anthologies (such as Snarf #6).
