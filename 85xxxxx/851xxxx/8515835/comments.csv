,BKKJack,2013-05-29T12:31Z,"This happens to a lot of TvTeam's torrents these days.

Shame none of them can be fucked checking them...

They seem more intent on just banging anything up they can, to get more hits on their iffy website."

,longpole001,2013-05-30T10:50Z,but file does not play with 512k missing - or is corrupted - what a pain - dont bother with this download 
,odexus,2013-05-30T14:45Z,"@PauFitl2008 If you used the torrent I pasted, it is impossible that you still stuck at 99.8 because i'm seeding this torrent since yest with my 10mbits. 100% complete."
,NishNab,2013-06-02T23:10Z,99.8 for a few days 99.9 after some point..VLC wont play it...use new source
