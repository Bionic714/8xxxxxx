Info:
----------
A hundred sixty miles off the coast of Baja California, a team of world-class anglers will land one of the most challenging fish imaginable: the great white shark. Unlike any other catch ever attempted, they'll lift an SUV-sized shark onto a platform, mount a long-lasting tracking tag by hand, take measurements and DNA samples, and release it unharmed... all within minutes. Marine biologist Dr. Michael Domeier uses advanced tracking devices to help uncover how this predator lives, with the ultimate goal of conserving and protecting this endangered species.

Plot:
----------
How well can you handle the great white shark? Join the shark research team as you measure the catch, tag it with a GPS tracking device, and take a blood sample. Watch out, this is one slippery animal.
