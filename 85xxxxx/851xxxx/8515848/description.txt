Really great art and some strangely surreal stories. Reminds me a bit of Dave Sim in places (for obvious reasons once you've read it), yet it was done before all but his earliest pre-Cerebus work. Admittedly, I like some offbeat stuff, but I'd definitely recommend this one for anybody who has been digging the books I've put in a word for in the past.

A short write-up/review of this books is available at the Comix Joint. Just give it a search, because links to that site don't show up in PB descriptions or comments.

As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!
