Summary:

On the outside, seventeen-year-old Madelyne Summers looks like your typical blond cheerleaderΓÇöperky, popular, and dating the star quarterback. But inside, Maddie spends more time agonizing over what will happen in the next issue of her favorite comic book than planning pep rallies with her squad. That sheΓÇÖs a nerd hiding in a popular girl's body isnΓÇÖt just unknown, it's anti-known. And she needs to keep it that way.

Summer is the only time Maddie lets her real self out to play, but when she slips up and the adorkable guy behind the local comic shopΓÇÖs counter uncovers her secret, sheΓÇÖs busted. Before she can shake a pom-pom, MaddieΓÇÖs whisked into LoganΓÇÖs world of comic conventions, live-action role-playing, and first-person-shooter video games. And she loves it. But the more she denies who she really is, the deeper her lies becomeΓÇªand the more she risks losing Logan forever.
