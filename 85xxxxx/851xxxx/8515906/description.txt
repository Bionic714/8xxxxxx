Nature Documentary hosted by Tony Leonard Moore, published by PBS broadcasted as part of PBS Nature series in 2012 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

The story of two remarkable and extremely rare white lion cubs on their journey to adulthood. Both are female, sisters born as white as snow in May 2009 in South Africa's Kruger Park. Growing up on the savanna, they must not only overcome the same survival challenges that all young lion cubs must face, they must also overcome the threats their high visibility brings. Their mother and their aunt raise the two white cubs alongside their young cousins--two tawny male cubs. There is no male lion in their pride to protect them against the dangers that constantly surround them--herds of buffalo, elephants, other predators like hyenas or leopards, or rogue male lions who would kill the cubs in order to start a new family with the females. But the lionesses who guide them and care for them are fierce and savvy, determined to keep their young family alive.
