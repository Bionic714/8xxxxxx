description:

The spiritual and psychological insights of these essays were nurtured in a monastic milieu, but their issues are universally human. Merton lays a foundation for personal growth and transformation through fidelity to "our own truth and inner being." His main focus is our desire and need to attain "a fully human and personal identity."

This classic is a newly restored and corrected edition and the inaugural volume of Gethsemani Studies, a series of books that explores, through the twin perspectives of psychology and religion, the dynamics and depths of being fully human.
