Like many people I had seen the 70's TV Movie but never read the book. I think there was only one printing of the original paperback, which accounts for the steep prices as it has become a cult favorite. I do not want to spoil anything but will warn you the book is far darker than the toned down TV movie. Ronald is really really bad!
