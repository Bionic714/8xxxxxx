I am having really slow seeding speed issues as always and wanted to know if anyone would like me to email it to them instead and they can either upload it or not. The file is only about 73MB and I can send it via toobigforemail. dot com. I got it from a friend and he said the credit serials still work. I am using V2.26 now and I will probably uninstall that and try that out. If anyone is interested, let me know. "
,cechant,2013-05-28T10:31Z,"Thanks,I hope to succeed in getting it.

I will try with an other internet provider to solve the speed problem..

Thanks"

PM me on suprbay.org

but never upload any serials here because aerosoft will blacklist all of them..."
,maddog7777,2013-05-28T11:08Z,@kingashi- I sent you a pm.
,maddog7777,2013-05-28T11:16Z,"@kingashi- I sent you a pm. At least I hope I got the right person...lol... 

@cechant - I am seeding a lot of torrents from all over and that it probably why. I do not want to stop yet until I know for sure they are on solid ground. I figured if I try to upload that now, it would at very horrible speeds... "
