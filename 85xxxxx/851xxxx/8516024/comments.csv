they dont seem the brightest

why dont they just build a big tent or a tent over the seam they prospecting.. then thehy can work in the heat of the tent on the seam even if its one man tent someone could do something but why not big tent to nail down over a spot :)"

bit lame they didnt tell us how much they earned from gold etc while there and how much they spent

but when watch it.. and wondering you can calc some of it out I guess

how much you should pay for a one-carat ruby. A one carat ruby can be worth ten dollars or it can be worth $10,000. Quality makes the difference. Fortunately you can see differences in quality if you look at a lot of rubies side-by-side. Better color costs more, a lot more. Better clarity costs more"
[V],psspss,2013-05-28T10:58Z,"on top they also earn
each cast member was paid $22,500 per episode
WOW

thats $120K per person from tv show

plus the gems and gold they find"
[V],psspss,2013-05-28T11:02Z,"hmm seems that answer was revoted

now be changed to

Barely anything. Just enough to be able to leave their jobs for 2 months

LOL so we will never know really. $22K would be bare min for being on tv I would of thought though considering how much actors get from 100K to 1million per episode"
,q2323,2013-05-28T21:34Z,"each cast member was paid $22,500 per episode? lol no way....

thanks for the upload i like the ending"
[V],psspss,2013-05-29T03:54Z,"why no way.. how much do you think the producers and the cable tv made from it.. I bet millions

paying 100K to each member isnt they far fetch just they probably wouldnt

I suspect they made abotu $200K from the venture as miners a lucky last day huh"
