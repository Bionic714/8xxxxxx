Holly Valance - Footprints [2002] [only1joe] FLAC
		
Footprints is the first album by Australian singer Holly Valance, released in the United Kingdom by London Records on 14 October 2002.
The album was a success in the United Kingdom, where the first single "Kiss Kiss" reached the top position on the singles chart. Footprints peaked at number nine on the albums chart, selling over 100,000 copies and being certified Gold.
In Valance's home country of Australia, success was similar. Footprints reached the top fifteen, sold over 35,000 copies, and was later certified Gold. All three of its singles also reached the top 3 on the singles chart.
Footprints was also successful in Japan, where the album reached number nineteen on the Oricon albums chart and sold 159,606 copies. It was later certified Gold and became one of the big international successes of the year in that country.
"Kiss Kiss" was the first single released by Valance. The single was released in April 2002 and went straight to #1 on the UK and Australian charts. "Down Boy" was the second single, released two months after Valance's debut single "Kiss Kiss". It became a smash hit on the day of its release. "Naughty Girl" was the third and final single from the album, becoming a Top 3 hit in Australia and Top 20 single in the UK. Six months later, a fourth and final single, "Tuck Your Shirt In", was announced; however, the single was cancelled due to poor sales of the previous single, and Valance was beginning to record her second album, State of Mind.
