,escalade200st,2013-05-28T19:35Z,i dont see the point of uploading this and then sayin if ur gonna complain not to download. ur a fuckin idiot ur audio is way the fuck off.might as well have no audio if u gonna do a shitty job at this 
,cjay2334,2013-05-28T21:47Z,@escalade suck a dick. this is the best thats out right now. its a decent cam and if you had half a brain you would know you can fix the audio syncing on VLC Player.  Thanks Pimp4003 for the upload!!
,omnipote,2013-05-29T01:46Z,Thanks :)
,crumrugin,2013-05-29T02:43Z,check the screens first.. kinda way blurry you think? not that I have anything better 
,imagic5,2013-05-29T03:43Z,"@cjay2334: escalade200st is right.  If you're going to upload a 4/4 quality, why bother uploading it at all?
It's a waste of people's time and frankly I'm glad that there are people here who are honest about the quality of the rip.  Now I know I don't have to waste my time downloading this version.
Thank you simon, escalade and crumrugin."

They can look at the screens, if they dont like what they see, then dont download. and for a cam this is pretty decent.  i would give it A:8 v:6"
