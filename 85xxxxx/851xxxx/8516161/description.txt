Hey baby, Little Steven here, and this weekend in the Underground Garage we are celebrating a bunch of cool birthdays including Marlon Brando and Eric Clapton.

Our Freak of the Week is one of the freakiest actors ever.

Joining us will be some of the freakiest artists ever, like Iggy Pop, the Saints, the Kinks, the Dead Boys, the Animals, the Yardbirds, and the Strangeloves.

Brand new music from Wyldlife, the Woggles, the Bayonets, Mark Lindsay, and Palmyra Delran.

Find out what Kim Fowley, Little Eva, and Frank Sinatra have in common.

It's the only Rock n' Roll dance party on the radio.

I'll see you this weekend in the Underground Garage.
