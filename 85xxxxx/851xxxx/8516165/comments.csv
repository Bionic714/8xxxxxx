,dauntless10101,2013-05-29T03:55Z,Thanks!  What did you use to rip these from Netflix?  How did you encode them?
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-29T16:40Z,Checked the first episode and the quality is rubbish. QRUS is where it's at.
,wanderlustus,2013-05-29T17:08Z,"All in one shot.  Cheers, mate."
,wanderlustus,2013-05-29T17:10Z,"They're shite?  Please explain?  Don't usually see skulls pissing on one and other, at least without good reason."
[V],GoodFilms,2013-05-29T22:05Z,"Yes, pass on this one. I'm only saying because I love this show and it'll be worth waiting for QRUS to do all episodes. They've done two so far."
,bon-bongo,2013-05-30T21:35Z,"Awful quality - looks like upscale from 480p, will wait for QRUS."
,HellFrog,2013-05-31T01:23Z,watermark in the middle of the screen popping up during episodes 'SHOW STEALER PRO TRIAL VERSION'  not horrible but come on???
,HellFrog,2013-05-31T06:32Z,"update, QRUS converts are amazing, this torrent truly is a waste of bandwidth and not real 720p.  Thanks to uploaders but skip it and wait for the TV Team QRUS versions"
,HellFrog,2013-05-31T16:44Z,"I got punk'd by the show!! 'SHOW STEALER', yep I live under a rock, I love this show"
,xtheghost,2013-06-05T10:47Z,This is def not 720p... 
,dauntless10101,2013-06-05T18:50Z,"Do not download.  Very poor quality, has a framerate problem, not worth it."
