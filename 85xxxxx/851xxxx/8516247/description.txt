60 Years Israel Navy
by Klaus Mommsen

DESCRIPTION:
A comprehensive look at the history of the Israel Navy, from its inception in the early 1930's through its 60th anniversary in 2008. Organized chronologically, the book covers all aspects of the Israel Navy's history, including equipment, peacetime and wartime operations, organizational and conceptual development, changing roles and missions, as well as distinguished personnel. Going far beyond mere naval or maritime aspects, the author also sketches the historical development of Israel's ongoing conflict with both the Palestinians and its neighbouring Arab states.
