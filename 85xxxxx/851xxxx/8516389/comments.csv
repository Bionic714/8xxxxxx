,2Guys1Sandwich,2013-06-07T09:41Z,Hey guys i got this game a few days ago and started playing up to the unlocking of the WSR tournament. Now i literally cannot play because the lighting goes up and down (by this i mean it goes brighter and brighter to white and then darker and darker to black) but the HUD and map are perfectly fine. I can go on a test drive without this problem but the the official race is problematic. Any suggestions?

The light goes brighter and brighter till it's white and then it goes darker to the point it's black. I haven't had this problem previously and the hud and speedometer are still perfectly visible while the problem is persisting. Any solutions?"
,internetruler,2013-06-09T14:11Z,Only problem to me is the sound. It's noisy and makes it unplayable without muting. Any solutions? i also had to download 4 .dll files to make it start :|
