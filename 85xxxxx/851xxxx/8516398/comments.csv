Tried this on my home theater system and was completely blown away.

Any chance you could do Anamanaguchi's new album ""Endless Fantasy""

Also, how the fuck do you do these? I'd love to know."

I could give the Anamanaguchi a shot.  Have been listening to the album lately.  Like what I hear.

Just visit the good folks at surroundbyus.com and learn how you do this.  There's nothing I do that someone else can't do with some practice.

Again, though, thanks a ton."
