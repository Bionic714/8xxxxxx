,MPlovers,2013-05-28T16:36Z,"Mr.Stifmeister why is your torrent of only 5.72 GB, when HeroMaster Torrent is of 10.07 GB"
,MPlovers,2013-05-28T16:39Z,"why is your torrent of ""5.72 GB"" when heromaster torrent is of ""10.07GB"""
,moeburn1,2013-05-28T17:19Z,"I'm guessing this torrent is half the size because it is english-only, whereas the 10gb one is MULTI-8 languages.  Dem talkin parts, dey big."

,ronthegamer,2013-05-31T11:38Z,"THOSE EXPERIENCING CRASH AFTER THE GRID 2 LOGO, DO THIS....



1- GO TO Documents-My Games-GRID 2-hardwaresettings



2- USING NOTEPAD, OPEN ---> hardware_settings_config



3- PUT THE NUMBER OF CORES IN BETWEEN ---> workerMap and Core 

""workerMapFile=""system/workerMapCore 

Mine is 5 (core i5). THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, AFTER I MAKE THE CHANGES

workerMapFile=""system/workerMap5Core.xml"" (do not forget to put .xml at the end of it. 



4- UNDER GRAPHICS , ""forcedx9=false"" change to ""forcedx9=true""


5- SAVE THE FILE AND START THE GAME


6- IF YOUR GAME STARTS IN WINDOW MODE, CLICK ----> alt+enter


7- PLAY THE GAME


THANKS TO Dz_95 FOR MENTIONING THE THREAD "
