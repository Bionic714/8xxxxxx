Place: grid 2_[DangeSecond]RedistVisualvcredist_x86.exe

Virus Name: Virus.Win32.Neshta.a

Date Detected: 12 Dec 2005 15:46:00 +0400

Date Published: 09 May 2006 22:59:00 +0400

Technical details:

This malicious program identifies and infects executable files. The program is a Windows PE EXE file, written in Delphi. The file is 41472 bytes in size.

Installation

The virus searches the Windows system directory (%WINDIR%) for svchost.com, which it deletes. It then creates a new svchost.com file, which contains the body of the virus. The following key is created in the system registry:

[HKCRexefileshellopencommand]
@=""%WINDIR%svchost.com ""%1"" %*""
This ensures that at each system restart, the virus will be automatically launched."
