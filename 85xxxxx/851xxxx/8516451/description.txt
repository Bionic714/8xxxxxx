This widget will help you to start your prefered apps or call your best friends - but with style!
You can add some frequently used apps, contacts or bookmarks to this launcher and start those apps, contacts or bookmarks with one click from a circle, a horizontal or a vertical line. Use the included launcher icons, load your own image or use a icon from any icon pack (CircleLauncher icon packs, ADW and Go Launcher icon packs supported). If you slide over the icons, they are animated a little bit mac-like ... just try it!
There are some issues with Android 3.x+: There is a default shortcut at the home screen that will be created after the installation - this shortcut works only for apps, but the CircleLauncher is a widget and has to be added to the home screen using the widget selection ... the shortcut will not work and can be deleted. Also some devices need a restart (or wait a few hours) until the new installed widget appears in the widget list.
Additional features in the full version:
- custom icons for the icon on the homescreen
- support for ADW icon packs for the icon on the homescreen
- vertical and horizontal launcher versions
Some icons in the screenshots are from 'CircleLauncher IconPack One', 'Minimal UI', 'Glasklart Go Nova Apex Theme', 'Circles Theme', 'Motif' and 'Rain' - the clock is 'lockscreen watch'.
Please don't move the app to the sd card - it won't work!
