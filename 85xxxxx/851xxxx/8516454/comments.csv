,km11,2013-05-30T21:54Z,"please remove internet explorer 8,microsoft games,and windows media player 11,then integrate mozilla firefox,vlc media player,and
latest java runtime "
,UltraCat,2013-05-31T15:56Z,"Smartass : You must write ""Updated Hotfixes up to may-2013"" ... in torrent´s name... but don´t  say SP4 , that is not fair to the newbies or untrained people.

Microsoft have said openly many times :  ""we don´t plan to create a SP4 installer for XP""."
,UltraCat,2013-05-31T15:59Z,"From another POV , the release looks good. Thanks for sharing.  Everyone will decide if download it or not."
,ibraram09,2013-05-31T17:59Z,"If you want to say it in your words as it is the most improved version of windows xp, you are right. I agree with you but if you wanna look at the fact, you are mistaken coz I have installed it with goood which i have for you but I was shocked to see that it was still XP service pack 3 not 4. I dont want to share any discouraging comment for u as  u r doing a graet favour fr the people like us."
,ibraram09,2013-05-31T18:00Z,Dear brother do not misinterpret my words. I am always full of praise for the wonderful efforts you are doing for us.
,km11,2013-05-31T21:16Z,yeah yeah...praise the lord

,lolzob,2013-06-02T16:38Z,"@km11

,lolzob,2013-06-03T14:04Z,"@km11
I have seen, you are not smart man ... you must first time READ DESCRIPTION of the torrent ... it's hard when you do not know to read.
You're a sick man, go to the doctor and treats you or go to to the madhouse!
Have a nice day!"
,km11,2013-06-03T21:57Z,"im not smart but im genius.
"
,ibraram09,2013-06-06T18:39Z,"I would appreciate if u add netframe wrk to windows 7 and 8 releases and if u add serial key to ur xp releases. I have to reosrt to somebody else when u don not add these things otherwise your releases are the best on the net. Hopefully you would consider my request.
I would be graetly thankful to u.
Regards 
Ibraram"
,lolzob,2013-06-07T12:48Z,"@ibraram09 
windows 7 are integrated .net framework 3.5 and 
net framework 4 and 4.5 it`s optional for everyone to download.
windows 8 are integrated .net framework 4.5.
I'm sorry but, i do not add serial number in windows xp, because it`s like a signature for my.
If you need the serial number, you can find in torrent to a file under the name of ""info.txt""!"
,lolzob,2013-06-07T13:04Z,"I do not understand!!!
In this moment uTorrent shows me the 97 seeds and thepiratebay shows me 65 seeders, why ? Anyone knows?
This happens about 2 weeks, before approximately 10-15 minutes thepiratebay was the same as uTorrent!"
,lolzob,2013-06-07T14:21Z,seeds!
,czeslawosso,2013-06-12T21:11Z,"Hey lolzob. You are doing are REALLY good job with those XP/Win7/Win8 packs. Keep it up and ignore idiots writing stupid comments. I tested this version of WinXP and it works good, but I think you missed flash player this time (is mentioned in torrents description). In your windows packs it was listed under installed apps, in this case it's not. Everything else appears to work (.NET framework, player, sata drivers, power shell, bitlocker, even silverlight)."
,stingrayopp,2013-06-14T07:11Z,"brother lolzob, what about the  "" June edition 2013 "" by your own effort ? when would you submit the latest month [ june]of Xp sp3 2013 version for us ?"
,lolzob,2013-06-14T13:19Z,"@czeslawosso
I missed flash player? 
I think in the rush I forgot to integrate it.
Sorry!
Thank you for your encouraging words.
It would be nice if all people would appreciate my work. 
But, all fingers are not the same, and so people are not the same."
,lolzob,2013-06-14T13:24Z,"@stingrayopp
I hope this weekend to be ready windows xp ... 
at the latest next week (maximum 23 june)  to be ready!"
,czeslawosso,2013-06-14T23:25Z,"Can't wait for new releases of XP and 7 for june. Could you skip integration of flash player and silverlight? They both are not and essential part of windows, instead could you integrate .NET framework 4.0 (with security updates) into your Win7 releases? Integrating .NET frameworks into install makes later deployment less of a hassle. Everything else is fine. Thank you again. I'm a big fan of your releases, all tested, all working great."
,czeslawosso,2013-06-15T00:26Z,"Oh yeah. In my opinion with Windows XP you should stick to the SP3-SP4 formula, it's definitely better and more complete than just system security updates/hotfixes. But remember to change torrent name to SP3. It won't attract so many morons that way. ;)"
