My antivirus gave a false positive but what else is new??  lol.  I just disabled my antivirus for 10 minutes while I installed it and cracked it then I added the game folder to the exceptions list so my antivirus wouldn't scan it ever again.

So far the game is fun as hell.  This is a game I plan to buy when it goes on sale on STEAM sometime.  its $49.99 on STEAM and I don't think the game is worth that so I will wait till the summer sale before I purchase it, till then my cracked version will do just fine :D :D

If you are having an issue getting this to work then as usual its the users fault.  Stop blaming the uploader for you being to goddamn stupid to figure out a simple torrent file, lol.

Get a brain, and understanding of the basics of a computer, go buy a decent computer, and get rid of that piece of shit welfare computer you bought at Walmart."

I read half a dozen reviews while this was downloading and all said what a great game it was with emphasis on how good the handling was. I now know that codemasters must be paying these fuckers to lie thru there teeth. it not even as good as grid 1 the gameplay is really boring making you repeat the same track three times in a row as you eliminate the one on one groups. I sadly unistalled this after a couple of hours i'll never get back trying to like it. Even for free it cost too much. my opinion only of course. you might like it. id be fucking surprised if any half serious racer liked this game though.
