,king2795,2013-06-01T12:46Z,"my grid 2 starts but dont show the game , got a black screen , with this crack or just simple change on steam api

someone can help me ? "
,vagenrider,2013-06-02T13:54Z,works but no save..
,RSF1903,2013-06-04T03:49Z,"king2795 your problem solved:
In Documents, go to DocumentsMy GamesGRID 2hardwaresettings.
You should look for the file named hardware_settings_config.xml.
Open the file in a text editor and look for the line:
directx forcedx10=”false”
Once, you find it, you should change it as follows:
directx forcedx10=”true”
Save the changes and run the game again."
,SleepingZUMBI,2013-06-04T14:53Z,It's saves the progress in game ? 
,shipo007,2013-06-10T18:01Z,this did not fucking work at all..it just upgraded my dumbass steam manager...and after that whenever i try to run the game i shows me the steam store and asks me to buy this fucking game...
,jlc4life,2013-06-13T15:04Z,"It gives me an error «application can't start normally (0xc0000022)»

Anyone knows what is the problem ??"
,Ploomp,2013-06-13T18:17Z,i get to the press start screen then it says checking for downloads and crashes. ive already edited the dlc id as well as forced directx10 value to true. need help!
,jlc4life,2013-06-14T17:42Z,"Now it started and it brings me to Steam / Grid 2 communauty and I know why it is because I can't move the steam_api.dll 

Anybody knows why ?? (I am the admin of this computer)"
,jlc4life,2013-06-14T17:57Z,"Never mind both of my last comment for no particular reason I restarted my pc and I've been able to move steam_api.dll
