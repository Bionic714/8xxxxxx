I think TxJag could put them too, but it'll take time and money as Stephen king has more than 100 books.
so you have to wait for TxJag for reponding."
,jojoclen,2013-05-29T12:48Z,Yes I know it will take time previously I requested him dean koontz books i hope it will be uploaded soon I like horror novels a lot.
,jojoclen,2013-05-29T14:07Z,And also I requested him because he managed to post 101 James Patterson novels.
[T],TxJag,2013-05-30T05:29Z,"@jojoclen Hey, I had already planned the James Patterson ahead of time. Same with Agatha Christie. Dean Koontz and Stephen King will take some serious planning on my part. If I had to GUESS then neither one may not make it till some time this fall but they are on my to do list I promise that."
