From the MAD Project. Inspired by my sister (sent two songs) I was looking for more African flowers to make a small bouquet. Actually quite hard, because I already picked most interesting songs for earlier playlists.
 Fortunately a collector always has a waiting room, full of songs, just waiting to be listened more closely (I imagine a well known person performing the song. Its fun and at the same time I learn whether I like to play the song for you too and share.). So what began as a trip through memory lane ended in a real Safari.... Enjoy,
