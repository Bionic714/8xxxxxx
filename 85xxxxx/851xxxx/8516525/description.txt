           ==========================================================




Who uses SketchUp Pro?:
======================

Hundreds of thousands of professionals in (take a deep breath) architecture, construction, engineering, commercial interiors, light construction, landscape architecture, kitchen and bath design, urban planning, game design, film and stage, woodworking, and plenty of other fields use SketchUp Pro all the time, every day. Its the all-purpose antidote to complicated, expensive CAD software.

A smarter way to think about 3D modeling:
========================================

SketchUp Pro is like a pencil with superpowers. Start by drawing lines and shapes. Push and pull surfaces to turn them into 3D forms. Stretch, copy, rotate and paint to make anything you like. More advanced? Start modeling from CAD and terrain data, photographs or even hand sketches. Build models with custom behaviors and attributes. SketchUp Pro is as simple and as powerful as you want it to be.

Turn your models into drawings with LayOut:
===========================================

At some point in every project, you need to produce a set of drawings that shows your model: plans, sections, elevations, perspectives. LayOut in SketchUp Pro lets you add model views to pages, choose drawing scales, adjust line weights and add dimensions, callouts and graphics. Changes to your model are reflected automatically in LayOut. When its time, export PDFs, images and CAD files.

Get good, fast:
==============

Theres a reason SketchUp is synonymous with friendly and forgiving 3D modeling software: we dont sacrifice usability for the sake of functionality. With handy contextual tips, a dedicated Instructor panel for beginners, and mountains of online resources, help is always on the way. And just in case, every SketchUp Pro license includes a year of free technical support.

No software is an island:
=========================

We built SketchUp Pro to slide right into your existing workflow. Ready for some alphabet soup? With importers for DXF, DWG, 3DS, DAE, KMZ, TIF, JPG, PNG and a few more, you can bring in drawings, models and images to your hearts content. SketchUp Pro also exports all of those formats, plus PDF, OBJ, FBX, XSI, VRML, MP4, WEBM and AVI. OMG.
