  Minneapolis punk band Off with Their Heads began in 2003, taking their membership from area punk and hardcore institutions like Dillinger Four, Dear Landlord, Banner Pilot, and the Fake Boys, among others. Based around the depraved and hard-living themes of vocalist Ryan Young's songs, the band existed mostly in the form of an endless string of EP and split 7" releases for many years. Also focused on constant touring, Off with Their Heads maintained a revolving lineup so they could stay on the road more often. In 2007 they released All Things Move Toward Their End, a collection of highlights from the group's lengthy vinyl-only catalog. This compilation was followed in 2008 by their first proper full-length, From the Bottom, and the group self-released a video for the album's song "Fuck This, I'm Out." The band followed up in 2010 with In Desolation. By the time their third album, Home, was released in 2013, the band had finally solidified a permanent lineup, with Young on guitar and vocals, Robbie Stewartwood on bass, and Justin Francis on drums.
