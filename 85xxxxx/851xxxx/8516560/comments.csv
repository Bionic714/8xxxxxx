,freakforyeshua2,2013-05-28T19:35Z,Awesome! Loved these guys. Thanks my man. Would you happen to have a collection of Everybody Duck by the way. No big deal if not.
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-28T22:03Z,"Freakforyeshua2, Wish I had some everybodyduck for you.  I know they have a handful of albums, but unfortunately I don't own any."
,freakforyeshua2,2013-05-29T04:55Z,"Thats cool, I have 2 of them in my collection, maybe I can get them downloaded and share with you all. I hope you dont mind me asking these request. I see you have Chris Rice but not bundled and I can't get them downloaded due to no peers in streams. Can you put a discography together."
[V],TorrentTracts,2013-05-29T16:38Z,"Freakforyeshua2, it would be my privileged.  I transferred over Chris Rice into a discography for you earlier today.  I will torrent it once I complete some of my existing torrents, and free up some bandwidth.

Please keep the requests coming.  My collection is quite abundant and yet it often only gets shared if/when someone like yourself asks for it."
