104 page magazine with COLOR

JACK KIRBY COLLECTOR #60 continues in its new format (104 magazine-size pages with COLOR SECTION, $10.95), with a Fantastic Four follow-up issue to #58's THEΓÇêWONDERΓÇêYEARS! It starts with a dynamic, never-before published Kirby FF wraparound cover (and wait'll you see the flip side)! Also, we present a dual interview between classic FFΓÇêinkers JOEΓÇêSINNOTTΓÇêand DICKΓÇêAYERS! Then, there's a rare Lee and ΓÇêKirby interview, and we compare one of Jack and Stan's FF Bullpen story conferences to what ended up on Stan's final script and Jack's penciled pages. Plus there's MARKΓÇêEVANIER and our other regular columnists, and galleries of Kirby FF art, including pencils from Kirby's BLACKΓÇêPANTHER, SILVERΓÇêSURFER, and more! Edited by John Morrow.
