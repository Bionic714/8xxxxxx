,ChingaTuu,2013-05-29T03:57Z,"...I remember the show quite well. It came along at a time where the musical-variety show got kicked in the balls *hard* with Nixon's pressuring See-BS to cancel the Smothers Brothers and their groundbreaking show - Hint! Hint! Exec? :). Cash himself experienced a bit of that pressure when the issue of his being a somewhat more-than-recreational pot smoker came to light, and while it wasn't enough for him to turn tail and run, it did force him to take a good, long look at the lifetime expectancy of the whole comedy-musical-variety act genre.

...""Hee Haw"", which See-BS rushed into production to replace the SBCH, had become the genre's nadir - not counting ""Pink Lady and Jeff"", and that was even before Rosie the Hippo ruined comedy-variety on TV for all eternity just a few years ago - while ""Ed Sullivan"", arguably one of its zeniths, could only last as long as its host did, and that demise wasn't long in coming. Sonny and Cher's show, as well as Cher's solo series, benefitted from the fact that 95% of the creative staff, including most of the camera and lighting guys, were refugees/veterans of the Smothers Brothers show. And Carol Burnett herself saw the same writing on the wall that Johnny Cash did and retired her show while it was still on top(*). 

...But above all that was the so-called ""Rural Purge"", where See-BS cancelled any show with a tree in it. Cash had gotten a hot tip from a buddy who worked for the AC Nielsen company that See-BS was going to go by demographics and not hard ratings to determine what shows to air, and that even though his show never dropped below a 20-share during its two-season run, as demonstrated just 8 years later with ""Battlestar Ponderosa"", having high ratings does not *ever* guarantee renewal at the end of the season. So, as Carol Burnett would do a few years later, Cash pulled the plug on his own show, and let See-BS take the heat.

...Demographics were a two-edged sword when they first came out. Where they would have kept ""Star Trek"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"" and especially ""Batman"" on for at least twice their original runs, they also caused a whole slew of programs to get shitcanned - some even before their pilots were filmed! - in favor of shows that were more in the interests of that segment of the baseline audience that had the most disposable income. It's this same sort of programming criteria that kept complete and utter bullshit like ""Seinfeld"" on the air for 12 seasons longer than it had a right to be. 

And yeah, that's two years longer than the show was in production. The math is *not* incorrect, kids. The show was *that* bad. And yet...well, as the Pythons pointed out, even a six-foot-tall penguin has more intelligence than your average TV network programming executive...

(*) Granted, the late Harvey Korman argued on numerous occasions that the show could have made it another season or three, but Carol decided to let Tim Conway have at least *one* series besides McHale's Navy to his name where he wasn't the reason it got canned!

[thinks]

...Hey, Exec? You wouldn't happen to have that Comedy Central recolorized run of ""McHale's Navy"" by any chance, would you?"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-29T15:16Z,"I'm anti-colorization, Chinga, so surprised you asked that!  Sure McHale's Navy looked better in color but ONLY the two feature films they shot in color while the series was still in production.  I was never a fan of that show anyway.

I do like Tim Conway's other work though.

As for The Johnny Cash Show, that was on ABC and not CBS so I'm not sure why you went on a long rant about that.

And finally, President Nixon had nothing do with The Smothers Brothers being cancelled by CBS.  It was Dick and Tom's personal battle with network censors that was an issue as early as their second season.  By Season 3 things came to a head and NOT because of censorship, but due to the fact that the brothers were late in getting their tape to the network for early review. 

The Smothers Brothers were able to return to TV on a regular basis a couple of times though. First in 1975 as a summer replacement series. Pat Paulsen was back and comedian Don Novello got to play Father Guido Sarducci for at least the second time before SNL. 

They even got to return to CBS for 2 partial seasons beginning in 1988, and that version of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour was similar to their classic series. Even Pat Paulsen was running for Preisdent again! Only by that time they were making fun of Reagan and Bush, Sr.
Comedian Gallagher (then alerady famous from his Showtime specials) and veteran TV actor Geoffrey Lewis were  frequent guests.
What was unique about that version was Tom showing off his yo-yo tricks."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-29T20:36Z,"Here's why Johnny Cash's show ended.  
Johnny probably would have kept doing it :

"" The show was canceled in 1971 as part of ABC's involvement in the so-called ""rural purge"" in which all three major broadcast networks eliminated rural and older skewing programs. The purge also affected ABC's The Lawrence Welk Show. """
