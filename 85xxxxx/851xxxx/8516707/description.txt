Galaxy Angel II Mugen Kair┼ì no Kagi (πé«πâúπâ⌐πé»πé╖πâ╝πé¿πâ│πé╕πéºπâ½II τäíθÖÉσ¢₧σ╗èπü«θì╡ Gyarakush─½ Enjeru II Mugen Kair┼ì no Kagi?) is the second Galaxy Angel II game, and it is the sequel to Zettai Ry┼ìiki no Tobira. Two new members join the Rune Angel Troupe, being Natsume Izayoi and Roselle Mateus.

It has been half a year since the war caused by Verel. The army of EDEN and NEUE get the control of ABSOLUTE back, and UPW (United Parallel World) is founded. UPW rules ABSOLUTE and is independent of EDEN and NEUE. Its main task is to open the various closed Chrono Gates which lead to other universes.

The rejuvenation of NEUE is on track, and EDEN and UPW won't intervene internal affairs of NEUE any more, to keep NEUE independent and to keep its culture inimitable.

Rune Angel Troupe and Luxiole are under UPW's command, instead of EDEN. Luxiole's Former Captain, the Hero of Transbaal Empire, Takuto Meyers, becomes the Supreme Commander of United Parallel Worlds. Coco Nutmilk whose military rank is captain takes charge of Luxiole provisionally.
