,NordicF1,2013-05-30T16:49Z,Pascoal: i would really appreciate if you didnt put up a spoiler like that. You ruined the race for me.
,NordicF1,2013-05-30T16:50Z,I guess its no point for me to download this now that i know who won.
,NordicF1,2013-05-30T17:10Z,"Oh and btw, you fucking idiot!"
,pascoal,2013-05-31T02:32Z,"NordicF1: You live where? Mars? Only then not to know that he won this race. And finally, you're a fucking stupid idiot for write this words. ;)"
,barnaba64,2013-05-31T19:14Z,"please do not hate, because I will remove torrent.I nothing can be added later."
,PoliticalHeretic,2013-06-02T05:37Z,"I watched, and seeded and was so grateful!  My father and I used to listen to Indy 500 on the radio because it was blacked out in indiana (they want you do go to the race.)  We were to poor to go, so we would huddle around with radios or walkmans and listen.

As years went on and we moved my Dad and I continued to watch IndyCar and the indy 500.  He died last year at 63.  I was already an IndyCar fan, but now the Indy 500 means even more to me. 

I have no TV and tho working hard really can't afford it.  I really appreciate every single indycar race you upload!  I can't tell you how much :) "
,barnaba64,2013-06-02T09:45Z,"I'm happy that I could do something for such people like you... I myself am a fan of indy and such races when J. Villeneuve won...You can't forget such races... In Poland it""s also hard to have television because it's very expensive... Besides there are no transmissions of indy on tv... You're welcome:) Take care.."
,NordicF1,2013-06-11T19:49Z,"Pascoal: I live in Norway and i stay away from news untill i have seen the race so i dont get any spoilers. You dont put spoilers up on a torrent, thats something everybody knows."
,NordicF1,2013-06-11T19:53Z,"If you need to talk about a race after its finished you should go on Twitter like everybody else.

Thanks for the upload anyway barnaba"
,NordicF1,2013-06-11T20:52Z,"Sorry for calling you an idiot, but im guessing you would feel just as angry as i was if someone spoils a race for you.

The last few laps of this race was very exiting, would be alot more fun if i didnt know who would win.

Peace!"
