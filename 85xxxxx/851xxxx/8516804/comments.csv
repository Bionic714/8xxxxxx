Audio Bitrate........: 256kbps, 48hz, Stereo

Used CM8's source and cleaned up and increased audio, brightened video and other filters to improve picture quality.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that sounds good right?  Well unfortunately it is not.  I am not sure where they got the 256kbps sound from or if they just saved the original (lower quality sound) as a higher bitrate which would mean that they were just bloating the file size.  It is like taking a 720x320 video and stretching it to 1620x720 and claiming it was now 720p HD (which some do thinking pixels just magically appear to fill in the missing data).

Anyway, this is the same old video with the blurred watermark, but brightened.  So that helps out in dark scenes, but makes them far too overblown in the lighter scenes (like on the bridge with all those silly lens flares).  It also looks like they managed to increase the size of the blur, but I cannot be sure on that.  It is very distracting in their sample, that I am sure of.


It took nearly 25 minutes to download just the NFO, so please start posting the NFO in the Info Box.  Cut and paste is fine.  Thanks!"

,tflagger997,2013-05-29T19:24Z,"@acsmith1972 - How else could I make sure that everyone got the message?  Most people do not go into 3 or 4 versions which are obviously (name and file size) exactly the same.  So most people would not get the message if I only posted it in one.  Hence, the same thing covering all.

It would also be unfair if I only targeted one poster's work to give a negative review to the source material.  It would look like I am trying to troll their work (posting the torrent)."
