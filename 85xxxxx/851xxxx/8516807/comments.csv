It's hiding under steam_api.dll
Use at your own Risk!

Once you quarantine/delete it you cant play the game anymore."
,ronthegamer,2013-05-31T11:37Z,"THOSE EXPERIENCING CRASH AFTER THE GRID 2 LOGO, DO THIS....



1- GO TO Documents-My Games-GRID 2-hardwaresettings



2- USING NOTEPAD, OPEN ---> hardware_settings_config



3- PUT THE NUMBER OF CORES IN BETWEEN ---> workerMap and Core 

""workerMapFile=""system/workerMapCore 

Mine is 5 (core i5). THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, AFTER I MAKE THE CHANGES

workerMapFile=""system/workerMap5Core.xml"" (do not forget to put .xml at the end of it. 



4- UNDER GRAPHICS , ""forcedx9=false"" change to ""forcedx9=true""


5- SAVE THE FILE AND START THE GAME


6- IF YOUR GAME STARTS IN WINDOW MODE, CLICK ----> alt+enter


7- PLAY THE GAME


THANKS TO Dz_95 FOR MENTIONING THE THREAD "
,IAmTorrenter,2013-06-08T02:49Z,"what the fuck man?!?

i also got a trojan warning from the steam_api.dll in this torrent after installation.
just like mr.maxout said, its unplayable without it. waste of my time and data.

im using bitdefender and it is pretty accurate. its rare that it would pick up a false positive, especially from a steam_api.dll file.
i would suggest avoiding.
