That one sucks, hope it is different."
,Godless.,2013-06-02T02:21Z,"Absolutely GREAT torrent!
The game is awesome too. I've read comments about bad controls, especially with the 360 controller - I had none. I'm playing this on a 3y old laptop (i3, 4g ram, amd 5650 1gb) and xbox 360 wireless controller and I really enjoy it - great graphics and code optimisation, runs smooth in full HD.
I sure will seed ;) worth downloading!"

does anyone know how to fix this?"
,marcpb,2013-06-14T14:13Z,"Was working great, having a great time playing it, one day it did not start, saying steam_api.dll was missing. I installed it, and nothing happened, game wont start and no message appears. I uninstalled it, and installed it again, same thing, game simply wont start and no message. Any good soul out there could help me? Tks."
