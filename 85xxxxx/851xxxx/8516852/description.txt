The National Enquirer is the US publication of legend. Known for its high level of sensationalism and dubious veracity, The National Enquirer has nevertheless broken some very significant stories; notably the OJ Simpson case as well as news of Jesse JamesΓÇÖ illegitimate child, and also solved the murder of Ennis Cosby, in recent years almost managing to replace its "Elvis is alive on the moon" stories with more appropriate articles.
