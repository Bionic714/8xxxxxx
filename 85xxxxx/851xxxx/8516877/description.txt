Wake the Sleeping Giant is the first full length release by experimental, progressive, indie rock band Sputnik Monroe.

ΓÇ£SputnikΓÇÖs Wake the Sleeping Giant is by far one of the best releases of 2005 from either a signed or unsigned band. The production, the instrumentation, the intensity, the sweeping melodies-unreal. I am honored to have heard your music before the rest of the world knows your name-and they will.ΓÇ¥- Skinnie Magazine
