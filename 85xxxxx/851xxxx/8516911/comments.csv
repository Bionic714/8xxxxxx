[V],globeplus,2013-05-28T21:37Z,"Hi wherever you are and this comment it is to say that i was in a middle of many work when i get this video file from a net site and after the downloading i only checked the file integrity and watched the first few seconds and everything looked normal about the video then i finish another uploaded file to get enough speed to upload this video file and i did it , so i removed the other file now going acceptable to the possible downloaders and started this one and with the peers with more percentage in about 15% already , i taked a more close look at the uploaded video when i noticed that the guy that shooted the cam started uploading this video file on the net without correcting the incorrect perspective of the camera at the time of the shooting and then what we get after a few seconds on this cam : about 30% of blackscreen at the top of the picture and making the viewer watching the video in almost half screen style with the top part of screen only black to watch then i tought to myself : why the guy from the shooting didn´t get a nice video tool and correct the perspective of the camera before the uploading? it is impossible that he didn´t noticed how was shooted the camera , i have to say to this guy in appreciation for his work that in certain circunstances on the cinema the shooting somehow can get ununexpected problems and that can happen all right but if that happen the camera shooter grab a nice video tool and try to correct the imperfections on the shooting camera before start uploading the cam all over the net on the movies sites ... it is the more correct procedure and respecting the unknowledge on the matter of correcting a camera perspective i can always remember that the google search can be in handy in many things including in a case like this but besides that Virtual Dub a very well known freeware video tool have a perspective plugin that can be downloaded and integrated on the video tool plugins that can correct more as possible the incorrect perspective of the camera and with that get the screen that was shooted occupying about 60% of the totality of the picture in pure and usual fullscreen  without the view of the picture suffer anything with that , can be about 90 minutes codification work but in the end the shooted picture will be at the all screen with normality making disappear completly the black screen on the top of picture and the video still going with naturality besides the perspective correction ... so i want with this comment making excuses from this possible upload giving solutions at the same time and wish happy movies to all of you ..."
