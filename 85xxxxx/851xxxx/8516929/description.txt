
Camera 2 is the ultimate real-time effects app.
Take better pictures, amazing videos and have fun creating them.

Featuring many unique high quality effects, grouped into families sharing a common theme:

- Old Time: make your camera look like something from the 20's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's or 80's
- Lomos and Retro: everyone's favourite, from normal to sublime.
- Comic: to express yourself, half tone, B&W, printed comics, new style, mix and match
- Art: sometimes you just want to create a piece of art with a tap
- Sci-Fi: see it to believe it
- Computer: and finally, for every geek or nerd out there, this is unmissable. Old computer monitors

Many of the effects can be boosted by applying a superb "out of focus"/"depth of field" filter, and, as usual, it's all real time.
