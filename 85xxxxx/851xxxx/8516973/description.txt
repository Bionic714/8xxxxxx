Blabla Kenya:

Dj's Mina Alaa and Fady Hany A.K.A(Fady & Mina) born in Cairo,(Egypt). From
the early years their talent for music was clear. Fady got his first keyboard
at the age of 6 and Mina's first mix was at the age of 12 , They also began
by listening to all kinds of music (Pop, Techno, Rnb, etc.), then started
listening to trance; they were both fascinated by the melodies, beats and
everything about this music. They were taken by the tunes of great producers
like Paul van Dyk, Marco V, Tiesto and the Egyptian heroes(Aly and Fila).

Trance is not only a music they have listened to, it was a lifestyle, after
playing some dark tribal, the music concept and culture has been completely
changed into the world of melodies and uplifting beats.. Following the steps
of Aly & Fila and Philippe el Sisi, bringing the energy back again to trance
music, with the passion to create and innovate in the electronic music scene
world-wide. After that they decided to create their own music, so they've
started to invade the trance scene by listening to all types of Trance music,
and they've known the passion inside them towards this genre.

They performed in many parties and privately organized events for their
friends. By days, they were first introduced to people by (nile fm),their
sets were aired on the local radio station, and they gained positive feedbacks
from their friends and Djs. They started to set up their studio and they
produced a couple of tracks, and it was the start that never ends!
