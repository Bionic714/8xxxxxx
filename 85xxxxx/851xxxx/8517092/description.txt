From the Publisher

"Life of the Beloved" has become Nouwen's most cherished book. He wrote it at the invitation of a friend, who asked him to write something about the depths of spirituality in language that people unfamiliar with theology and scripture could understand. His friends loved the book, and so have readers ever since.
