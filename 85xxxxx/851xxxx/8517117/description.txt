A Canadian classic of historical fiction about World War I. I read somewhere that in Canada, this is a commonly-read school novel, but it seems to be little read outside Canada. So, Canadians, is it worth reading?


description:

Robert Ross is a Canadian officer caught up in the nightmare world of World War I trench warfare; a world of mud and smoke, chlorine gas and rotting corpses. In this world gone mad, he performs a last desperate act to declare his commitment to life in the midst of death.
