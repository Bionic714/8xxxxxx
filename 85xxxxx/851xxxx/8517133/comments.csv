[V],globeplus,2013-05-28T22:08Z,Hi wherever you are and yes the FULLSCREEN VIEW means that the blackscreen on the picture was removed with video tools giving a normal viewing to the film ... happy movie to all of you ...

[V],globeplus,2013-05-28T22:46Z,"Hi again and this comment it is to say that the original shooted video cam had wrong perspective on the shooting showing to the viewer almost half screen black (the top half) and the camera shooter didn´t corrected this video insuficience , i uploaded a first file with the video like that without notice and in the middle of many other work that i am doing and when i realized how was the camera shooting i explained in a comment of the first file what happened and corrected the camera perspective with video tools and uploaded with natural screen as possible for a cam this new file with the picture really occupying all the screen , not only half of screen as it happen on the first file ... i wish a happy movie to all of you and cams can get this type of insuficiences times to times ... see you all around here at piratebay ...

[V],globeplus,2013-05-29T14:03Z,"To TWEETY2455 : hi there wherever you are and you right about the camera shooting , certainly not one of the best cams you already saw available for any movie but it looks like the only cam for the moment , maybe in a near time a new cam can be available or a dvdrip but i have to say independtly of the general possible quality of the video that what really shocked me more was this cam uploaded in lot of movie sites with only half screen style with the top half in blackscreen  and that somehow it is amazing , it is like everything it is valid to have new movies cams available on the net , after this cam be available all over the net in many movies sites what can be happen next about general new cams that can be available to watch ?... well the answer i think we will never know , the best way is to pray for the guys that make the cams get luck on the shooting and can be useful too if them knows how to work with video tools to try to correct circunstancial insuficiences on the shooted video ... see all of you around and nice movies to all of you ..."

,Mogwai79,2013-05-29T23:32Z,"Globeplus: I'm sure you mean well, but I really can't understand what you're saying.

You really should upload some screenshots. That way we can see what you mean instead of you trying to explain it to us in text. It would really help."
