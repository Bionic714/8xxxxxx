Galaxy Angel II Eig┼ì Kaiki no Toki (πé«πâúπâ⌐πé»πé╖πâ╝πé¿πâ│πé╕πéºπâ½II μ░╕σè½σ¢₧σ╕░πü«σê╗ Gyarakush─½ Enjeru II Eig┼ì Kaiki no Toki?) is the third and final Galaxy Angel II game and it set 3 months after the events of the previous game, Mugen Kair┼ì no Kagi. The name of the game was first announced at Rune Angel Troupe: The 4th Concert. The subtitle of the game can be misread as "Eig┼ì Kaiki no Koku", but both the radio programs and the game itself confirm that the subtitle is "Eig┼ì Kaiki no Toki".
