At worst it's filthy liars trying to scare you, manipulate you, and, ultimately, take money from you. You are gullible and deluded if you buy into any of this garbage. Those of us who live in an evidence based reality find that life is much more amazing and enjoyable than these assholes would have you believe. There is no evidence, no actual proof that any god exists. So relax. Enjoy life. And tell these fear peddlers where they can stuff it."

Ever had a payback ? Prophecy is the greatest proof   How about the NO MISSING LINKS IN ANY SPECIES Many events took place exactly as portended in scripture Your in for a sad surprise someday
