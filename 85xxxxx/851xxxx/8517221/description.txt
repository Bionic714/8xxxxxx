EUA VERSION !

CCleaner is one of the most powerful and effective solutions to clean up the entire PC, deleting unnecessary files and gaining more privacy by removing packages that store activities conducted while browsing the web.

Our computer has a number of files that are recorded daily to store system information, cookies navigation, records programs installed and uninstalled, backup data, historical instant messengers, among others.

Therefore, it is likely that sooner or later your computer is slow and takes to start or load your favorite software. In this sense, this cleaner can also help improve the performance of your machine by removing junk files and organizing or retrieving those who still can be availed by the OS.
