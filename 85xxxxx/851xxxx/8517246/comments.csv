,wwaddict,2013-05-29T07:29Z,"Hey, yeah, uploader here, if my voice counts, it's real.  It's a netflix rip, so the audio/video goes wonky at moments, but it's genuine 1080p basically all the time.  Seeding like crazy here :P"
,bon-bongo,2013-05-29T14:56Z,"Bad quality, same as NFRIP - VERY blurry. Please, don't download that dreck."
,wwaddict,2013-05-29T17:46Z,"Dude, it's buffering at the beginning of the first episode!  Give it 30 seconds, and it's crystal clear.  Try one of the other episodes too before calling my torrent dreck."
,avarice,2013-05-30T02:49Z,"Thank you; just curious, does anyone have a link to a how-to for recording Netflix streaming content that they could post here?? 

I personally am trying to grab 1989's ""Hillside Strangler's"" and 2010's ""Jim"" from there, neither of which have never been released on DVD..."

,birstmooth,2013-05-30T09:49Z,"Don't download. This is a fucking travesty.

1080p it might be but the original certainly wasn't and has just been upscaled. The guy hasn't even removed black borders from the side.

Luckily I have bandwidth to spare cos now I'll just be deleting after wasting 18GB of quota as this is unwatchable.

Dude you need to be flayed alive."
,Jannic69,2013-06-02T18:52Z,"@Birstmooth - Are you joking? Download one episode first if you're nervous of the quality. This is FREE FUCKING TELEVISION YOU ARE PIRATING. Also it's not goddamn Planet Earth, you don't need it to look like a painting, it needs to be good enough quality to get the jokes - which it totally, absolutely is. Huge ups to the Uploader. "
