The little green dinosaur is a curmudgeonly soul occupying a world of walking, talking, scheming mice and rats - smarter than all of them. The little green dude named Picadillo gets no respect, but there's some entertaining stories in these two issues.

As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!
