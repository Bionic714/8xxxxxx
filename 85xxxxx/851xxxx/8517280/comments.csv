I'm just passing by to thank you for your good taste and will to share this material because most americans don't know european comics. I'm having a blast reading Guilty Pleasures and Clara After Dark. I've always been a fan of Jordi Bernet but never heard about this series. Thanks, again and keep up the good work! Excelsior!"

The 4th (and last) Guilty Pleasures book will come eventually, I just need to finish translating Valhalla 15 before I get time to do scan of Guilty Pleasures so Alice can get something to translate and retext on :)."
