And here you go, the third book in the Guilty Pleasures series, scanned and edited by me, and translated and retexted by Alice.

Guilty Pleasures is short 1-2 page gags about our hero, Arthur, and his various sexual escapades, or the lack thereof :).
This third book is completely focused on Clara, giving it a more feminine touch. Arthur is only in a few times as a cameo, but dont worry, Clara is just as apt to getting into sexual mischief as Arthur is.

The art style is cute and funny, but it IS adult in nature, so don't give this to your kids :)
