Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Tuesday, May 28 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex covers the increasing furor over Obama's multiple scandals and the corporate media blackout over the massive anti-Monsanto protests on the weekend. Alex also takes a look at John McCain's surprise visit to the CIA's al-Qaeda mercenaries who are attempting to overthrow the al-Assad regime. He also confronts the refusal of the establishment media to cover the upcoming Bilderberg meeting. On today's worldwide broadcast, Alex confronts to globalist cabal as it cranks up the heat on the world economy and exploits the war on terror to increase the police state at home.

Near the end of the third hour and through a half hour of "ovedrive," Alex talks with World Bank whistle-blower Karen Hudes.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
