'Like Nobodyz Bizness Funnies'

Adam's Apple Distributing Co., 1972, 36 pages

Written and Illustrated by George Hansen

I'm a big fan of Hansen's work. It's incredibly psychedelic and often quite funny. It probably helps if you've opened a few of those doors in the mind at some point in your life. But even if you haven't I don't imagine it would be too hard to appreciate his many richly detailed drawing styles. This book, like his others, features a reoccurring cast of characters.
