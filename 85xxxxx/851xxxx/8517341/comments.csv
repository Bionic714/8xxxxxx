The hardware is supposedly out in the garage boxed up with *two* working power bricks, but the manuals were in a box that got soaked and tossed in the dumpster about 15 years ago or so. I'd love to get the damn thing up and running for old time's sake, especially since I've got one LED monitor that'll take old TV RF Analog signals. Might even convince me to dig up those old DIY graphics board upgrades that let you run your VIC in - gasp! - 40-column mode!!!"
,Needz234,2013-05-29T05:06Z,The VIC-20 was before my time! All I remember is my friend used to draw a house and a car on it. Great computer though as the next gen-c64 was based on the same hardware. Seems like the VIC was more customizable and experiment driven than the c64. I will ask around and see if I can get the reference guide or a programmers aid but don't hold me to that! :) be careful w/ running the VIC in 40 column mode you might wanna break it in for a few hours!!! :D
