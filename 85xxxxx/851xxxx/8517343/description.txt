'Legion of Charlies'

Last Gasp Eco Funnies, Fall 1971, 36 pages

Written and Illustrated by Ron E Turner, Greg Irons, Tom Veitch, Dave Sheridan

The sagas of Charlie Manson and the Charlie Company at My Lai Vietnam intertwine in this protest against "a government that dehumanizes its citizens and makes robot killers out of them". Dedicated to the brave veterans who turned in their medals to Washington D.C. on Memorial Day 1971.

This is a pretty dark and unsavory anti-war/government book. Entertaining and even quite funny in places, yet I still found it to be a very heavy read. Some of the best done by some of the best names in the underground scene.



A full write-up/review of this books is available at the Comix Joint. Just give it a search, because links to that site don't show up in PB descriptions or comments.

As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!
