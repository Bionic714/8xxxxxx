,Jack_Reacher,2013-05-30T05:14Z,"They finally found a roll that is perfect for that fucking douche Matt Damon.  He most likely required no rehearsal as he knew all the moves first hand.  What a dick ... Or I should say, dickless."
,village1diot,2013-05-30T09:42Z,"hey Jack_Reacher, I can understand why you don't like Matt Damon. He is always speaking out against people that like to burn American citizens. Yeah, we all know that everything is fine in America. We have to let the greedy morons, like you I'm sure, take over. 

Fuck Matt Damon for sticking up for people in need."
,Maximum38,2013-05-30T13:48Z,"The television premiere of Behind the Candelabra, starring Michael Douglas as flamboyant pianist Liberace, was seen by 2.4 million people in the US.

The Nielsen Company said it was the HBO network's biggest audience for one of its original movies since medical drama Something the Lord Made in 2004.

A further 1.1 million people tuned in for a repeat of the film that aired immediately after Sunday's premiere."
