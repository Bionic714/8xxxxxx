You're full of shit. Prove it with screens, don't just say it. 
This movie doesn't look so great and you can't expect much detail (sharpness) from it, see pics at bluraydotcom

Here is a comparison between bluraydotcom & my encode:   http://imgbox.com/g/vNijUChtLV
If you really mean that 720p looks sharper you shouldn't bother with 1080p-s in the future, your monitor or player or configuration are not right for 1080p. Or simply you're blind lol.
""A:10 (for not being re-encoded)"" ?
Lol, what a non-sense! Audio was trans-coded from TrueHD (if you bothered reading description).
If you can't appreciate a movie for free and uploaders's effort but instead unfairly criticize  you'll just look like a cheap troll. Fool!"
