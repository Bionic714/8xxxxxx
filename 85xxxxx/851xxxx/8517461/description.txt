'Judy Tunafish'

Adam's Apple Distributing Co., 1973, 28 pages

Written and Illustrated by George Hansen

As the title implies, this one contains mostly Judy Tunafish stories. Not quite as great as some of his other books, but still work checking out, and certainly one you'd want to keep if you're a completist like me.

As a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!
