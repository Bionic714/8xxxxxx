Surely youΓÇÖve experienced something like this: you buy a red car, and suddenly red cars appear everywhere. Why? Because youΓÇÖre focusing on red carsΓÇöand you get more of whatever you focus on. But much of the time, consciously and unconsciously, we dwell on what we donΓÇÖt want, and thatΓÇÖs what we get. Drawing on the latest scientific research, Laura Goodrich shows you how to stop fixating on negatives and rewire your brain to focus on positive outcomes.
Unique and practical exercisesΓÇöincluding a free online toolkitΓÇöand dozens of enlightening real-life stories help you identify what you truly want so that it drives everything you do. And Goodrich shows how Seeing Red Cars can build organizational cultures in which employees are playing to their passions and strengths, focusing on what they want, and achieving breakthrough results.
