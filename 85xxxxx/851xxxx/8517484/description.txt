I enjoy watching on my Blu-Ray player, but it doesn't do external subs very
well & I'm guessing I'm not alone in that department. So here it is English
Hardcoded only in one scene, where there is non English dialogue (English soft
subs for the entire film, you may want to shut off for that one scene) . Also in
reguards to watching on Blu-Ray players, this film is effected by Cinavia on the
Blu-Ray release, but the DVD is not effected.


Wilee is one of 1,500 bike couriers in Manhattan who rides on the edge by
having a bike with no brakes. On this day, Wilee has a delivery that is so
valuable that a corrupt NYC Detective, who needs the money, begins to chase
Wilee throughout the city to get it before the envelope is delivered. Rated
PG-13
