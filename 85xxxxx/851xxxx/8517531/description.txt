  This book provides up-to-date information on experimental and              
  computational characterization of the structural and functional            
  properties of viral proteins, which are widely involved in regulatory      
  and signaling processes. With chapters by leading research groups, it      
  features current information on the structural and functional roles of     
  intrinsic disorders in viral proteomes. It systematically addresses the    
  measles, HIV, influenza, potato virus, forest virus, bovine virus,         
  hepatitis, and rotavirus as well as viral genomics. After analyzing the    
  unique features of each class of viral proteins, future directions for     
  research and disease management are presented.

  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :
  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :
  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :
  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :
  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :
  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :
  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323ΓÇô283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :
  : Ptolemy II (283ΓÇô246 BC).                                               /:
