,banzekin,2013-05-29T13:30Z,thank you
,mrknowitawl,2013-05-29T14:16Z,Looks like a shitty movie
,visionthing,2013-05-29T16:56Z,it got like a 3.8 on imdb....
,Jaymark_prs,2013-05-29T17:07Z,Sweet! Adrian Paul is back! I'll check this out! ty
,ghostrx,2013-05-29T18:41Z,Thanks!
,Bambootoo,2013-05-29T18:55Z,What shitty movie.....
,derrique,2013-05-29T19:28Z,"don't forget that low score was combined by the votes of only about 30 people.
i'm sure the score will increase to 6 or 7 after more people have seen it and voted.
the trailer looks pretty good, not a ""Blade Runner"" or ""Silent Running"" kind of sci-fi, more like ""Predator"" with lots of good FX and a larger cast.
i'll watch it and come back here to give my 2 pence.. ;-)"
,Phatfish,2013-05-29T20:15Z,"Nr. 4 at top 100. Sigh* 
The current state of TPB (the whole scene for that matter) never seems to stop disappoint me. "
,Amafule10,2013-05-29T20:57Z,"how can this be a good movie worth the 4th spot in the top 100 ?
It's a straight to dvd movie. Wasn't even released in theaters."
,tapp3r,2013-05-29T21:22Z,"Why the FUCK is this crap popular? Like it exploded onto the top 1, yet it's worse than most of the crap on TPB. Hasn't been anything good uploaded in a couple of days, this probably takes the price as the worst, yet it's top 1... wtf?"
,tdurden83,2013-05-29T21:46Z,"wtfever. I bet this movie is gonna be awesome. I can't wait for it to finishing downloading. I've been wanting to see this ever since I first heard about it. I think will and jayden smith are both great actors, and the plot seems pretty cool from the trailers. i'll post about quality once I get to see it"
,tapp3r,2013-05-29T22:10Z,tdurden83: You're confusing this movie with After Earth dumbass. 
,dixiediver,2013-05-30T00:00Z,:-)
,logan-x-art,2013-05-30T00:10Z,"hahaha, tdurden, you are an illiterate fucking donkey...

goddan you are stupid...it doesnt say will smith or jayden smith anywhere on this page...
"
,Boostpimp,2013-05-30T00:16Z,"Best movie ever...right up there with ""The Village"""
,stevemorse,2013-05-30T00:42Z,"Yup, this is bad, Adrian Paul deserves better than this"
,wizzard4all,2013-05-30T02:58Z,"You douchebags in here whining about this movie make me sick! I challenge any one of you to go out there and make a better movie yourself! Until you DO, keep your snarky posts to yourselves! 
#LOSERS"
,mErLoTtEs,2013-05-30T03:45Z,Couldn't get through the whole trailer. :(
,craddle,2013-05-30T05:20Z,There can be only one!
,Iceburgslim,2013-05-30T05:28Z,"This movie sucks so bad. The acting, special effects, story. So many inaccuracies. Waste of time and download. I apologize to anyone that I seeded."
,bobbo_nut,2013-05-30T05:50Z,"I love it when they release these shitty B-movies with similar names to the blockbusters. It fucks with the dumbasses on here (and the movies are usually pretty fun too)
A:10
V:10
M:2, but the shittiness of the movie makes it hilarious so it ends up an 8"
,injun_mojo,2013-05-30T05:59Z,ugh this is soooo bad ppl. super awful. dont waste your time unless youve got time to waste
,tdurden83,2013-05-30T06:44Z,"WHAT A SCAM!! THIS ISN'T EVEN THE RIGHT MOVIE! AND WILL AND JAYDEN SMITH AREN'T EVEN IN IT! WELL, I THINK I MIGHT'VE SEEN JAYDEN IN THE BACK IN THIS ONE SCENE, BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE. A/V QUALITY ARE GOOD THOUGH, AND THE MOVIE IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD, BUT I'M STILL MAD THAT I WAS LIED TO!!"
,dvdgeek,2013-05-30T07:35Z,"This is another one of those ""copy cat"" type movies. This is not 'After Earth' with Will Smith. This is a piss poor movie trying to scoop-up on some of the hype for the actual movie. "
,thr0waway,2013-05-30T08:06Z,"What goes up, comes down. This will probably be out of top 100 in a few days."
,Xandra87,2013-05-30T08:16Z,"tdurden83: LOL, wish I could read as good as you."
,Xandra87,2013-05-30T08:19Z,tdurden83: Helps if you read what your downloading sometimes..
,Kapri25,2013-05-30T09:24Z,"Oh the hilarity of the movie...it really did suck. 

@tdurden83: Dude? Seriously...look at the picture man. Look at the description. No one lied to you.

Kind of sad that it seemed like it was trying to do and avatar thing in the movie as well...the ""camo lady"" did not seem so much as a survivor as much as a ditzy bitch that has a survivalist uncle.

Thanks Scene4all but this movie really should have been put on the back burner and Adrian Paul should not have to have done this movie."
,AndySpartacus,2013-05-30T13:37Z,"movie got 3.3 on imbd.. :( is it even worth the download or will i be wishing that i had spent my time doing something productive like pulling out nose hair? 

A- ? 
V- ? "
,ouchyfish,2013-05-30T16:08Z,lol..Richard Grieco's name should be enough warning...
,hallumet,2013-05-30T16:17Z,Another example of how projects unfamiliar with the concept of production value manages to push their shit through and throw it up on top of the piratebay. This is tragic. I refuse to believe that the majority of torrenteers have this bad of a taste in movies. The torrent market is obviously rigged.
,mikoo2,2013-05-30T17:09Z,I love this film thanks
,kietaxx,2013-05-30T17:40Z,"Total bullshit movie and the bigghest waste of time I have had for a long time...
Watch ONLY If you want to see why movies shouldn't spend 99.9% of their budget on actors. 
Or better don't watch it at all, please..."
,FurryTadpole,2013-05-30T17:58Z,"I don't understand how anyone could actually like this POS movie, low budget, low grade acting/actors/production company sure A/10 v/10 .... M/ -1, still I must say thanks for the upload even though I am what people may call a movie coinsure, some are not and may like the film... thanks for your time and energy uploading!"
,FurryTadpole,2013-05-30T17:58Z,"I don't understand how anyone could actually like this POS movie, low budget, low grade acting/actors/production company sure A/10 v/10 .... M/ -1, still I must say thanks for the upload "
,Smektah,2013-05-30T17:59Z,@wizzard4all So only Movie directors can criticize movies ? Dumbest comment of the year
,FurryTadpole,2013-05-30T18:00Z,"A 10 V 10 M -1 , Crappy Film, thanks for upload tho!"
,FurryTadpole,2013-05-30T18:08Z,"I agree wizzard4all is a complete moron, haven't you ever heard of the term film critic? People come on here and look at the comments to get an idea what the movie is like whether it be A,V, or M. People are entitled to their own opinion. In America its called freedom of speech, so you must be one dumbass person, or should I say non intellectual "
,DLesion,2013-05-30T19:09Z,No wonder these horrible movies keep coming out. So many people watch and seed this shit when there are perfectly good movies with 0 seeders. Good job guys.
,norge96,2013-05-30T21:44Z,WTF did I just watch?
,TheChristx,2013-05-30T23:42Z,THIS IS NOT AFTER EARTH THE MOVIE STARRING WILL AND JADEN SMITH. ASYLUM MADE THIS DO NOT DOWNLOAD.

,mikeisagod,2013-05-31T08:24Z,"In fariness this movie was so much better than Avitar (from which it stole some themes). Yup, I was another tard looking for the Will Smith movie. A7  V7  M3 "

,Eldain,2013-05-31T14:35Z,"A10 V10 M -9999
Worst.Movie.Ever."
,bkay77584,2013-06-04T16:59Z,I watched this movie and accidentally soiled my couch with buttjuice. So awful. Richard Grieco especially needs to be lanced.
,bradm2579,2013-06-07T03:22Z,"Great Quality, thankyou for another great torrent,
