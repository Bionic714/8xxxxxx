Notes:

Another fine addition to anyone's controversial films collection. As there are no HD or blu-ray sources for the 1997 Lolita, 576p is the best resolution I come up with for this one. However, since the resolution isn't my usual 720p or 1080p, I added a few features with this one to sweeten the pot. First, I encoded a second selectable audio track with the director's commentary. Second, I included four extras from the DVD (resolution of extras is 480p.) As far as I can tell, this is the only version of this encoded in x264 instead of the obsolete XviD format, the only one in 576p instead of 480p, and the only with extras and a director's commentary track... so I don't think it's going too far to say that this is now the best torrent available of Lolita (1997). Enjoy!

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on "normal" sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you may need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.

(My 1080p encodes will still look crisp and sharp on monitors up to 28-30", and possibly larger. The above paragraph primarily applies to 720p and below.)

Please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
