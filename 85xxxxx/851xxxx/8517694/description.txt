Words from the Comix Joint, because I completely agree with them...

Guy Colwell spent two years in prison for draft resistance and took a lot of drugs in the 60s and 70s, both of which had a direct effect on developing Inner City Romance, the comic book series that defined his early career. In five books that span seven years, Colwell delivers a variety of gritty stories with gripping characters that reflect his life in Oakland, California, his two years in prison, and a lifetime of keen perception about life on the city streets.

Today's youth culture talks about "keepin' it real." Guy Colwell never failed to keep it real. Inner City Romance is caustic, raw, funny, daring and highly recommended.
