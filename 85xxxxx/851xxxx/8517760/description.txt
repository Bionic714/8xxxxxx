Pretty dark stuff, but some of it is very well done. In particular, each issue has a couple of stories with some incredibly well executed art. 


Words from the Comix Joint...

Only George DiCaprio would host such a macabre feast as Forbidden Knowledge. Filled with stories of cannibalism, incest, castration and exhumed corpses, the two-issue series wallows joyfully in its depravity. In the first issue, Jim Himes "Blood Lust of the Tupinamba" is particularly gruesome. The cruelty inherent to human history is a great excuse for Forbidden Knowledge to deliver some of the most stomach-churning and violent scenes in comic book history.
