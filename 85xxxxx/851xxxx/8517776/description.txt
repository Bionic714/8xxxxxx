Game information:

Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder, where anything is possible
and where nothing is quite as it seems: join young Jerry and follow a
peculiar white rabbit to the wondrous realm of Mousewood, a land where
critters can speak and where mystery abounds

It is here that Jerry's dream of being a magician comes true, though a
haunting, sinister force casts a long shadow over the forest. Someone
offers the residents of Mousewood a deal of their lifetime - tickets to
the greatest magic show that the world has ever seen. But the price is
steep, as they'll have to stake their most precious possessions and also
their lives

As the shadows grow deeper, the residents of Mousewood have only Jerry to
turn to. On an adventure full of laughter and tears, joy and fear, the
young boy will face the ultimate trial, leaving behind the world he once
knew, and his childhood, too, will become a thing of the past
