'The Big Trucker'

Dancing Rock Press, May 1978, 36 pages

Written and Illustrated by Dennis Dunn, Steve Eugene Abbott, Bill Sigfried 

First part of a projected twelve part comic novel about truckers. A sort of comic concrete poem book.

Not a great book, but a very interesting one. Certainly it's very grounded in the time it was produced. But it's still a real shame that it never went any further.
