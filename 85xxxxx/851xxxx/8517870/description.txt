The Avengers Protocol: Part 1 AND 2

 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2455546/


After so many years of life outside, The Red Skull is dying due to his imperfect Super Soldier Serum, so he teams up with MODOK (who upgrades HYDRA's tech) to kidnap Captain America so Skull can transfer his mind to a more fit body. After his defeat by a reassembled team of Avengers, Red Skull takes Iron Man's armor for its life support system, leaving Tony for dead. The Avengers get Stark to a new armor, but Red Skull attacks them at the mansion and is again defeated. Skull plans to take away everything the Avengers hold dear from their lives to their country by trying to have them hated by the people for failing to save the day. To even the playing field, The Red Skull brings together his team of power giants: The Cabal. The Avengers intercept a transmission, and remain together to battle the Skull and his new allies. To stay close, after the mansion blew up, they set up their base in Avengers Tower.
