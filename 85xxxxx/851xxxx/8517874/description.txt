Words from the Comix Joint...

Immediately after publishing the final issue in the Barbarian Comics series, Bob Sidebottom and California Comics launched the Barbarian Women Comics series (the title was never exactly the same on any of the three issues). The first two issues came out about a year and a half apart, while the third issue came 18 years after the second, in 1995.

Barbarian Women is, thankfully, less about barbarians than it was about women. Underground comic pioneer Trina Robbins contributes a full story to the inaugural issue, though the series was certainly never a feminist publication, as most of the content was produced by male artists and writers. Barbarian Women #2 features a lively cover by S. Clay Wilson.
