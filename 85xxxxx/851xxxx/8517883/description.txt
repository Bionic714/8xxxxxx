This World Oft Can Be is the first Rounder release, and second full-length album, from the Boston-based Della Mae. Recorded at the old Johnny Cash studio near Nashville, the session was produced by bluegrass guitarist Bryan Sutton and mixed by indie rock engineer Paul Q. Kolderie. This is traditional American music, not just a bluegrass session. It's a combination of tradition and eclecticism, which has become the signature sound for the all-female band who refuse to be pigeonholed. The 12 songs, all originals, are mainly live-in-the-studio first takes, with very little overdubbing except for some of the harmony parts and solos. That first-take feel shines throughout the session, especially on the more overtly old-timey tracks "Empire," "Letter from Down the Road," and the title cut. The remaining tracks rework modern roots music with an added edge and singer/songwriter sensibilities.
