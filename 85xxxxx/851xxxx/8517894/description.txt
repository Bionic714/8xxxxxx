How to download NEW big torrents faster
.
.
A: The more you are uploading the faster you usually download
Put ALL your other torrents on PAUSE
.
.
B: Set your Torrent Client to download in FILE ORDER
You can be watching some Episodes while the others are downloading
.
.
C: If you can not leave your PC on 24/7 then wait until there are a few seeders
If you switch off your PC then you take what you have downloaded with you
The seeders then need to upload them missing seeds AGAIN
When you return you might notice there is not much more available
That is because the seeders used their upload to replace the missing seeds you took away when you switched off your PC
