[T],pharmakate,2013-05-29T19:06Z,"""The best is yet to come""!!! Does that mean you're expecting Joseph and His Brothers too? You're a merciless taskmaster, you know that?

By the way, I just read John Woods is translating Zettel's Dream. Do you read Arno Schmidt?"
[T],penfag,2013-05-30T01:59Z,"You know, I've never read Arno Schmidt and until you directed my attention to it, I had no idea Woods had translated so many of his books (eleven to date by my count).

For many years I considered ""Dr. Faustus"" to be Thomas Mann's masterpiece.  Then in 2007 I picked up ""Joseph and His Brothers"" in the Woods translation and was awestruck by the monumental ambition of the work.  It's a hugely intimidating tetralogy (Mann likened it to a pyramid) and, unjustly, is the least well known of his novels.  That might also have something to do with the truly awful 1948 translation by Lowe-Porter.  But even if Mann doesn't always succeed in his ambition, the book richly rewards one's patience, especially if you keep a copy of Genesis by your side as you read, as a host of biblical tales leap to life with astonishing realism and psychological acuity.  In my humble opinion anyway.

All of which is a very long-winded way of saying: Yes, ""Joseph"" would be fantastic!  If and when you can find the time, or course.  I may be cruel but I don't want to be thought unfair.

[T],pharmakate,2013-05-30T02:46Z,"I'm glad I never tried Mann before -- I would probably have launched unthinkingly into Lowe-Porter's Magic Mountain and given up within 20 pages. But I somehow acquired the impression Mann was either (1) a novelistic Hegel, i.e., unintelligibly prolix, or (2) a hopelessly oblique proto-gay libertine. Neither concept much attracted me. Dipping into Woods' versions is showing me I was wrong. And your description of Joseph is consistent with what I've been reading elsewhere. I see Woods suggests reading certain portions first, before diving straight in from page 1.

As for scanning, I'll be keeping my eye out for cheap disposable editions of Joseph, Faustus, etc. I came across an old copy of some stories translated by, I think, Neugroschel? No, but something like that. I might go back to it."
