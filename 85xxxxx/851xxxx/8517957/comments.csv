,Chaoticdeath,2013-06-11T04:39Z,"well, the duplicates i cannot delete, and all of the so far torrents have been corrupted due to all of the torrents are set to my hardrive now, when i play them without it, it corrupts my uploads and makes me download which makes them dead... sorry everyone sincerely..  i will try one more time if it fails yet again, i will be uploading in rar files on my website server @ ghosttech.clan.su those whom are interested in my torrents if they end up failing then join this site and i will replace the torrents with archives if i can work it out then dont worry about it, sorry again."

,Chaoticdeath,2013-06-11T05:03Z,"Seeding an exact copy for a day or two before i release it, so it will have a good amount of seeds. will be naming it C.D.H.P aka variable v of name, after this i will repeat with my other torrents and will be renaming them as well."
