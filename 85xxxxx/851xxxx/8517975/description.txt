It was last spring 2012, and John GourleyΓÇöfrontman of Portugal. The ManΓÇöfound himself in New York City about to ring the bell at Danger MouseΓÇÖs apartment--a long way from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella, Bonnaroo and LollapaloozaΓÇöup until this moment, Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range.
