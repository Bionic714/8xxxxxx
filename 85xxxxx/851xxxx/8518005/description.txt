:Plot:
Aditya Shrivastav is a deserted army officer. He has a brother, Anuj. Anuj gets angry at Aditya one day and runs away. ACP Yashwant Thakur helps Aditya in finding Anuj, and later tells him that Anuj was killed in an encounter. Aditya reads a police report, which stated that Anuj was running away with drugs, and was shot dead on the spot. Aditya can't quite believe this so investigates himself. He later meets Ramona, who reveals that ACP Yashwant Thakur and his two other police officers killed Anuj for no apparent reason and lied to cover it up. Aditya wants to take the matter to court and chooses Payal as his lawyer. However, after losing the case, Aditya decides to take matters into his own hands by holding the three until they confess their crime. This was successful and, having secretly recorded this evidence, shows it to the Police Commissioner.
