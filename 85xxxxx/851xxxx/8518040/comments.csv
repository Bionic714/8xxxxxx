,mapPirate,2013-06-02T09:11Z,"@nursep Likewise. Greg Harewood has a few sets - mentioned above in the description. I would probably need to purchase these before I could share them as I've spent a lot of time searching and can't find them anywhere. As soon as I do get a copy of any though, rest assured I will upload.

@NANGAMOLE .ECW really is a pretty lousy map format, even on the lowest compression ratio it produces low quality images with lots of artifacts. Is there any particular reason you would prefer ECW files? Thanks for posting the OZI link too!

Thanks folks and keep seeding!"
,NANGAMOLE,2013-06-06T11:54Z,"Reson being I would like to use with other progs apart for Ozi.
