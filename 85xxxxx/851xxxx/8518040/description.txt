HEMA 2012 AUSTRALIA

A NEW RELEASE BROUGHT TO YOU BY MAP PIRATE!

*******************************************

ABOUT THE RELEASE

These maps were ripped and converted from 
the .qct files found in a fairly recent
version of the Hema iOS app. They should
contain all of Hemas digital maps of 
Australia up until 2013.

They have been converted to .ozf2 format
with corresponding hand calibrated .map 
files containing correct geo-referencing 
information. Each .map contains the 
relevant datum and projection.


FORMAT

.ozf2 & .map

I choose the ozf2 format as it produces 
high quality images at a fairly small file 
size, and it's fairly compatible with 
various map conversion softwares. The 
actual OZI Explorer software is also 
readily available.

If you would like to see these in another
format I can possibly convert them from 
the master files and make them available, 
just let me know.


CREDIT

All credit goes to Hema for producing these
absolutely outstanding maps. If you enjoy
using these maps please buy something from
Hema to let them know you care!

The main reason I converted these maps was 
because Hema's iOS app leaves a little to
be desired (it's basically a port of
Memory Map) and they have not made their
recent maps available (for purchase) in any 
other digital format.


YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TOO

I am looking for the following maps and 
would be happy to share them if you'd like
to send me a disc or upload them somewhere.
