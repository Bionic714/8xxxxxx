NATMAP 2008 AUSTRALIA 250K

A NEW RELEASE BROUGHT TO YOU BY MAP PIRATE!

*******************************************

ABOUT THE RELEASE

These maps have been downloaded in GEOPDF
format from Geoscience Australia directly,
each map has then been converted and
automatically calibrated to ozf2 format
producing a high quality raster version
of the original.

All 513 maps are included in this release.


FORMAT

.ozf2 & .map

I choose the ozf2 format as it produces 
high quality images at a fairly small file 
size, and it's fairly compatible with 
various map conversion softwares. The 
actual OZI Explorer software is also 
readily available.

If you would like to see these in another
format I can possibly convert them from 
the master files and make them available, 
just let me know.


CREDIT

Credit goes to Geoscience Australia for
producing these fantastic high quality 
maps. 

The maps are freely available
online, it just took somebody to write an
automation script to download and convert
them all!


YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TOO
