Orphaned at a very young age and adopted by his uncle, a Poojari, and aunt, Premvati, Devdhar lives a poor lifestyle with them and their daughter, Radha. Poojari works for Bade Thakur and his family and prepares astrological charts and organizes prayers, and asks him for financial assistance so that Devdhar can go to Bombay and study, which is approved. Years later Devdhar has matured, returns home so that Radha could get married. He meets with and falls in love with Bade Thakur's paternal niece, Manorama, his childhood friend. She likes him too, but is very naive about love and intimacy. Radha gets married to a much older man and moves out, while Manorama's marriage is arranged with Kunwar Narendra Pratap Singh. The wedding takes place with great pomp and ceremony, and a heartbroken Devdhar leaves the village to return to Bombay. A few months later he meets with Radha, who is now pregnant, and also decides to visit his uncle and aunt. This is where he will get the shock of his life ..
