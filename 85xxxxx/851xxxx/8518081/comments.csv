Are you going to up all of season 1?"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-05-30T18:57Z,"Yes, I have the rest of Bud & Lou's first season and 
all of the superior second year too....but I'm taking
 a break from it for the next few days to upload 
other series such as The Mothers In-Law and 
Joan Rivers' late 1960s daytime talk show."
