I have taken this and cleaned up the audio, and ran the video through 2 different filters and tweaked the contrast. It is a mkv format, 1280x520 FR-29.97 Audio= Stereo 44100 hz
Please Note: There is hard coded Japanese Subs for such things as English writing on screen, Bill boards, and such. That is it, there is no subs for Speaking.
