The years 1947-1955.

Mountbatten is sworn in as India's first Governor General and is immediately faced with the severe problems caused by partition. Nehru's government elects him as chairman of an emergency committee to tackle the worsening situation, which eventually improves, but the failure to accede of three states, Kashmir in particular, causes a permanent problem. In November 1947, Mountbatten returns to England for the marriage of his nephew Philip to Princess Elizabeth. Back in India he attends the funeral of Gandhi after his assassination by a Hindu fanatic, and in June 1948 he hands over as Governor General to Rajaji Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and returns to a somewhat hostile England. Mountbatten returns to the Navy in Malta under the command of some of his former juniors, and sets about climbing the ladder to First Lord, via Vice Admiral, 1949; 4th Sea Lord, 1950; Commander in Chief, Mediterranean, 1952; and Commander in Chief, Allied forces, Mediterranean in 1953. He finishes his tour of command in Malta in December 1954.
