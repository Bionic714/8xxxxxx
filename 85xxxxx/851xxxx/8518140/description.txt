"The Tiger's Tail" refers to the "Celtic Tiger" economic boom that Ireland experienced from 1995 to 2008 (Ireland was said to officially be in recession as of June 24th 2008).

A property developer with a trophy wife (Kim Cattrall), a thriving business and an Irish Enterprise Award to his name, Liam O'Leary (Gleeson) has grown rich off the back of the so-called "Celtic Tiger". In reality, though, his life's in meltdown. A scheme to build a national stadium has left him hugely over-extended, his son hates his guts and he's just discovered the woman he thought was his sister (Sinead Cusack) is really his ma. Not only that, but it turns out he's got an identical twin with a grudge..-bbc-
