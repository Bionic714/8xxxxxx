This so called ""integrated"" XP doesn't have a recovery console and not even the most essential drivers, after install I didn't have ethernet drivers, pci-express drivers, graphics drivers and other essential drivers, couldn't even connect to the net. In addition to that that burned CD is extremely slow.

If it were an unaltered CD, then it should have a recovery console (this is essential for XP repairs) and if it were a properly integrated release it should have at least the most essential drivers.

Bad, bad release, cannot recommend that in the slightest."
