That explains why there's no update or release notes on the dev's website.

Torrent contains these folders and files:
eat.nfo
eatmqm31.zip Folder
EAT.nfo
eatmqm3.rar
eatmqm3.rar Folder
file_id.diz
eatmqm32.zip Folder
eatmqm3.r00
file_id.diz
eatmqm33.zip Folder
eatmqm3.r01
file_id.diz
file_id.diz"
,bogarin,2013-05-29T16:13Z,"The installer is fine,but the serials don't work
as usual.
Never been able to find a working serial for mac version so that renders it useless.Anybody ? ? ?"
,bogarin,2013-05-29T16:23Z,"Please somebody Out there ! ! !
a working serial ! ! !"
,Tstart,2013-05-29T17:12Z,"I´ve just installed it with a serial from the torrent, worked just fine!

and the zip/rar/nfo files are a warez standard, don´t shout fake when you don´t know what you are talking about ..."
,bogarin,2013-05-29T18:35Z,"Its not working for Me,Tstart :(
I remember having a working 2.5 version but after that I installed a 3.0 ver. wich I never got regged cause the ser number was always rejected and I tried several.
3.2 is now giving Me the same problem.
Any advice of how can I clean the old reg.?
I'm not that good at macs(I have a hackintosh)
but I think I can manage to find the path if You instruct Me.
Thanks In advance ! ! !

,Tstart,2013-05-29T18:49Z,"bogarin: I´m a newbie om mac myself, oldschool pc guy :)

So I have no idea how to clean OSX to get rid of your previous attempts :/

I´m pretty sure I used the 2nd serial in the list, called a friend I installed it for a couple of weeks ago and that installation is still working.

,bogarin,2013-05-29T20:18Z,"Well, I tried them all at least twice hoping it'd work this time before posting my babycry but now you're telling Me by Your post that it's my machine the one with the problem.
I hope somebody else hops up with a tip.
thanks a whole for minding Me.
Keep it up ! ! !"

And as proof ... here ya fucking go:

Gooood night :D"
,iPlunder,2013-05-30T09:49Z,"You're all full of shit - there's NO WAY this works! This is one of the most f*cked up app torrents I've ever seen - there isn't a simple dmg and a serial like normal apps have.

First folder contains 3 more folders that all contain zip files. Unzip the first one and there's a folder called CRACK, containing serials. But the next two zip files can NOT be unzipped - every time it says ""could not extract.""
After reading the comments, I downloaded this lame-ass torrent TWO MORE TIMES, and every time the same results - zips will NOT unzip.

Tried to see inside the zips with Entropy and The Archive Browser, and they show a setup.dmg file inside the 2nd zip, but it CAN'T BE UNZIPPED!"
,Tstart,2013-05-30T10:48Z,"like I said ""the zip/rar/nfo files are a warez standard"" ... all scene releases are released like this.

It´s quite simple.

#1. unzip ALL zips in the same folder
#2. unrar the rar files that was produced by the unzipping in #1
#3 install

and before going off and accusing people maybe next time you can ask nicely instead?"
,ClubQBall,2013-05-30T14:07Z,"iPlunder - again, you're a first-class idiot.  I provided proof to you, specifically - as well as any dingbats - showing that this was installed and operating correctly.

Y'know, there's an old saying out there, son, about intelligence ...

""Better to remain silent and be thought as a wise man, rather than to speak and be proven a fool.""

You look like a complete fucking ass right now.  Shut up already, okay?  IT WORKS.  I have no need or desire to lie.  In fact, I can't stand or abide liars, fools, and loudmouths ... of which you qualify for all three labels.

So do us a favor, eh?  Go sit down somewhere, have a Coke and a smile, and just please, please, please ... SHUT THE FUCK UP."
,iPlunder,2013-05-30T16:17Z,"SUCK A DICK QBAlls.

If this was a PROPER torrent, there wouldn't be any issues. I've downloaded hundreds of apps, rarely seen one this fucked up!

A SINGLE rar is fine, not a bunch of bullshit folders and multiple rars!"
,Tstart,2013-05-30T16:46Z,"which word in the sentence ""the zip/rar/nfo files are a warez standard"" are you having problems understanding?

If it´s too hard to first unzip and then unrar, go download someting else ...."
[H],EverybodyLies,2013-05-30T17:18Z,"@ iPlunder
Fucking shut up already. You are pushing it too far.
The multi rar is the original scene release format, if you still didn't get it from all these comments."

,ClubQBall,2013-05-31T00:59Z,"iPlunder - 

Your Mom did it for me last night AND this morning, you simple-minded, whiny little bitch.

If you were even HALF as intelligent as you portray yourself to be, then you might wanna fucking pay attention to what these folks are telling your silly little ignorant ass.

DUDE, seriously???  SHUT THE FUCK UP.  No one else is sitting here, beating their fucking gums and bitching like you are.  Are you on a rag or something, you smelly cunt?  SHUT UP.

It's a VALID fucking torrent, you fucking ignorant toad.  If you're stupid too fucking figure it out, then just shut the fuck up and move the fuck on.  GODDAMN.  You whine like a little fucking elementary school bitch who's puppy got kicked by the neighborhood bully.

Pussy-ass motherfucker."

And you are ACTUALLY sitting here bitching about someone else's shit???  Dude, you need your silly ass handed to you.  You even ADMITTED to fucking up your own goddamned shit.

How the fuck old are you, boy?  Fifteen, sixteen years old?  Get the fuck outta here, you sad sack of smelly shit.
