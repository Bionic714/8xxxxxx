ItΓÇÖs Reality TV gone wild! The fur will fly when seven strangers are locked in a mansion, in the middle of a Saskatchewan wheat-field, debase themselves and attempt to destroy one another in order to win their luxurious abode and maybe even become famous. 

LifeΓÇÖs a Zoo is filled with the usual reality TV suspects: the vain, the villainous, the meek and the manic, in this case however the participants just happen to be animals. They may look cute and cuddly but donΓÇÖt be fooled, the ability for the characters to manipulate and manoeuvre is truly human.
