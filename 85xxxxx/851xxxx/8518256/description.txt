For the first time the hard to find collection is all together!

This set includes:

ALL 14 Original Series novels by Glen A. Larson
ALL 7 Original Series Continuation novels by Richard Hatch
ALL 4 Re-Imagined Series novels

Each novel comes with it's cover and in epub and mobi. Keep in mind most of these novels have NEVER been distributed as ebooks, so while I have tried to make sure they formatted cleanly please let me know if I missed a spot.
