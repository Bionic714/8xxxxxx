Wonder Momo was released in arcades in Japan in 1987. Ports include the PC-Engine (known as the Turbografx-16 outside Japan) and the Wii Shop Channel's Virtual Console, both of which are also Japan-only exclusives. A beat 'em up in the great tradition of 80s NAMCO titles, Wonder Momo now lives on as a ShiftyLook webcomic! Co-written by tokusatsu expert and super otaku Erik Ko and comic book veteran Jim Zub, the comic features the art of fighting games comic legend Omar Dogan.
