Official Xbox Magazine is a monthly video game magazine which started in November 2001 around the launch of the original Xbox. A preview issue was released for E3 2001, with another preview issue for November 2001. The magazine is bundled with a disc that includes game demos, preview videos and trailers, and other content, such as game or Xbox updates and free gamerpics. The discs also provide the software for the Xbox 360 for backward compatibility of original Xbox games for those without broadband and Xbox Live access.[/code]
