The Night of the Rabbit - is another beautiful cartoon adventure from Daedalic 

Entertainment. Like many other projects, from the pen of the German studio developer, 

The Night of the Rabbit has a so-called "second bottom" has a philosophical background 

and makes you think. This is not to say that the game - only for adults (in the best 

sense of the word). She and the kids like it, but not the fact that kids will understand 

all the ideas contained in The Night of the Rabbit. So, what's the game about? 

  The story is this. Once there was a twelve-year boy with a funny name Jerry Hazelnut 

(Jerry Hazelnut), currently living so grieved not specified, quietly dreamed that 

someday will become a real wizard. Overall, was a very ordinary child. But why ordinary? 

Absolutely do not even have. He dreamed of becoming a magician so much that it did not 

go unnoticed ...

Lose yourself in a tale of magic and wonder, where anything is possible 
and where nothing is quite as it seems: join young Jerry and follow a 
peculiar white rabbit to the wondrous realm of Mousewood, a land where 
critters can speak and where mystery abounds.

It is here that Jerry's dream of being a magician comes true, though a 
haunting, sinister force casts a long shadow over the forest. Someone 
offers the residents of Mousewood a deal of their lifetime - tickets to 
the greatest magic show that the world has ever seen. But the price is 
steep, as they'll have to stake their most precious possessions and also 
their lives.

As the shadows grow deeper, the residents of Mousewood have only Jerry to 
turn to. On an adventure full of laughter and tears, joy and fear, the 
young boy will face the ultimate trial, leaving behind the world he once 
knew, and his childhood, too, will become a thing of the past.
