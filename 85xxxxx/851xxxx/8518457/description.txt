The four realms have been witness to great evil over the centuries -- The Dark One, The Dream Eater and Helios to name a few. But none have threatened existence as we know it as much as THE BEING. Who or what is he? What does he want and how do the answers tie into the origins of Sela Mathers and the four hunters who banished a legion of monsters centuries ago? The prelude to Zenescope's Grimm event of the year begins now!
