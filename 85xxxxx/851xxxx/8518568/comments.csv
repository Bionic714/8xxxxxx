[T],locobot12,2013-05-30T04:42Z,"Thanks buddy! 


Quality is good."
[T],locobot12,2013-05-30T07:46Z,"Please ignore my previous comment. File seems to be corrupt, won't play more than twenty "
[T],RayCort,2013-05-30T14:06Z,"@locobot12, there is nothing wrong with the torrent. Comments like yours is what made me stop sharing before, because non appreciative people like you drive me mad."
,Erik_O,2013-05-30T21:31Z,"i also have trouble playing this torrent, but thanks anyway."
,goldpianogarden,2013-05-30T23:16Z,"So, what did you use to play this file?  I can't get any software player to play the file either past 10 seconds.  All your other many movies have been just fine, but this one I can't get to play, and my dvd program won't convert it either. thanks"
,ricker_23a,2013-05-31T04:34Z,"I've also had trouble with this one file. I downloaded it twice, and neither one will play with VLC, WMV or anything else, and it also won't convert using several programs. When I tried to open with VLC, I got an error message that said ""Broken or missing AVI index"". I tried the fix first but after almost 2 hours nothing had happened. Tried to play anyway, and only 10 seconds played and it was sideways. I'm a real novice at some of this stuff, so any help is appreciated!

I downloaded The Surrogacy Trap yesterday without any problems. It played perfectly.

I'm always very much appreciative for all your uploads RayCort. I don't get the Hallmark Channel so I would end up missing lots of great movies without your generous uploads!"
[T],locobot12,2013-05-31T06:09Z,"@raycort

I apologize if I offended you, that wasn't the intention. I did download one other movie from uploads and it played fine in VLC, but this one doesn't. I was too quick to comment but later realized the avi is corrupt. Please re-upload if you can. Thank you."
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-06-01T06:51Z,I don't know if RayCort capped it but I did Hallmark's 'Space Warriors' http://unpopular.xp3.biz/releases/?p=4070
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-06-01T19:15Z,friend uploaded it as torrent http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8528942
,Chansep20,2013-06-03T01:05Z,"Watched this movie on LMN and it was great, and was hoping that links would come out which they did to watch the movie, but they all are only 10 seconds, and I was hoping this was the full movie. I really appreciate you RayCort uploading all of these movies, but I really hope you upload the full movie of ""The Perfect Boss"". Thank you very much!"
,Chansep20,2013-06-03T01:12Z,"@locobot12 Did you get the movie to play full movie, if you did, how? =)"

,Chansep20,2013-06-03T03:50Z,"@luissa You got the movie to play the full movie? How? For this one, it only plays 10 seconds."
,luissa,2013-06-03T19:28Z,"ray :) hello! sorry to disturb you I am not trying to offend you or anything but the movie I tried to play it on Windows Media player and Windows media classic and it didn't play properly just the first ten seconds, if you have the time and if you can, could you upload it again please please?

,ShelbyJ11,2013-06-08T21:15Z,"Hi there RayCort, my name is Shelby and I just wanted to say thank you so much for uploading these movies to download and watch. All of the movies are great and work perfectly except for this one. This one plays for the first 10 seconds then just stops and freezes. It's not just your link, it's others too that I found on other sites. So, if you could get the link for the full movie, I'd really appreciate it. Hope you are doing well and hope you reply. :)"

,Chansep20,2013-06-10T23:25Z,@Erik_O How do you use the VLC file?
,jungcookie,2013-06-11T13:43Z,I tried it on VLC still stuck at 10sec :(
,Chansep20,2013-06-11T19:34Z,@jungcookie Same here. =(
[T],RayCort,2013-06-12T17:09Z,"I send my sincere apologies to those who download my torrents. I checked my copy and for some reason it is corrupted also. I must have been in a hurry when re-encoding to avi and did not pay attention. I am currently overseas and have limited internet, so can't do anything till I get home."
,Chansep20,2013-06-12T18:17Z,"@RayCort That's alright, thanks so much for attempting to upload this great movie. Your the best, and it's not your fault. It's other links as well, and sounds good. Let us know when you get home! =)"
[T],locobot12,2013-06-12T22:40Z,"@Raycort No hurry. Re-upload when you can. Thanks.

@Chansep20 Those ""other links"" you talk about are the same copy that Raycort uploaded here. Tpb uploads are almost always their original source. "
,Chansep20,2013-06-13T04:31Z,"@locobot12 Oh, I had no idea. New to TPB. =)"
,Chansep20,2013-06-13T05:29Z,"@locobot12 So, once he fixes this link, the other links on the other sites will be fixed too? =)"
