Would it be possible to post the newest and last Garth Ennis Battlefields series that ended last week? It's 3 issues long and called the Fall and Rise of Anna Kharkova. All the other Ennis Battlefields series are available in high quality scans on this website.

Also, the first two issues of the new Ennis Dynamite series Red Team are on this site but the next two issues which have come out are not on the PB. Thanks! "
