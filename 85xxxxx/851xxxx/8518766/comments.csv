Ive been seeding a good film for months because no body else besides TvTeam and I are willing to (I Was Nineteen ) it is a good movie and TvTeam is the ONLY provider of it ORIGINALLY, many people  copy other ups SO WHAT!!??   the more there are the longer they stay up"
[V],joshua13,2013-05-29T22:55Z,"i've dl'd lots of TV team torrents, but actually 1 torrent with 5 seeds is much better than 5 torrents with 1 seed. This is why Demonoind had a no duplicate rule (not that it was well enforced)"
,TWEETY2455,2013-05-30T14:35Z,"wrong there crum,if u have 200 of the same dls the less seeders we have.Just look at tvteam ups and compare with the ups from the others he has always the less seeders and that keep us from dling
faster,i am just saying he should be more authentic   he tries even to copy the same stuff from MVGROUP the best here on TPB.
And by the way i am entitled to comment weather y or others doesn't like it.Thts my opinion period."
