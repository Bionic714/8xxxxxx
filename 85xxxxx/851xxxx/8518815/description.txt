INSTALLATION!!!: 

YOU WILL NEED 7zip to Unpack or any other good Archive utility!

For the most part each file is self explanatory or contains a readme, but for some files you may need to mount the disk image. You can download a program to do so for free. Just google power iso,Ultra iso...etc.

For vsts that are only .DLL Files: Copy The entire folder containing the .DLL file into your VST plugin directory (generally C/Program files/vstplugins OR C/program filesx86/vstplugins). Rescan with whichever Daw you are using.

Shoutout to AiR,Delirium,H20,Assign,ComputerMusic, and any other Folks I may have missed that are attributed to this package!!!


PS!!!
SOME KEYGENS REPORT AS FALSE POSITIVES ON MOST ANTIVIRUS PROGRAMS. IF YOU EXTRACT AND A KEYGEN GOES MISSING&lt; TEMPORARILY SHUT YOUR ANTIVIRUS OFF AND INSTALL!!

Few Free tracks Included!!!=)
