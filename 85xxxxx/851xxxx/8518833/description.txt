In today's economy, maximizing the performance of every employee is critical to business survival and growth. Gen YΓÇösometimes called MillennialsΓÇöprovides an enticing opportunity for employers to increase their short-term profitability and create a long-term competitive advantage. Almost 80 million strong, Gen Y is the fastest growing segment in the US workforceΓÇöand now comprises the entire 18 to 32 demographic. Along with their ever-present cell phone and occasional backpack, Gen Y brings tremendous potential and timely skills to the workplace (just ask, theyΓÇÖll tell you). However, Gen Y can be notoriously difficult to attract, retain, motivate, and develop. Gen Y's new approach to work makes them a growing challenge or strategic opportunityΓÇödepending entirely on how you choose to employ them.
