,DWeX4,2013-05-29T20:25Z,TrueHD and DTS-Master audio can't tranfer with digital cables (RCA or optical); it can with HDMI but don't have that on stereo.

Does this mean we won't get DTS sound unless using HDMI?

I noticed on a wonRicht release yesterday there was no ""DTS"" icon on kmplayer. Usually this is displayed with other encoder releases to indicate DTS sound is being outputted."
,DWeX4,2013-06-06T09:17Z,"DTS and AC3 (Dolby Digital), which are compressed, can play without HDMI."
,DWeX4,2013-06-06T20:02Z,"In my set-up, TrueHD and DTS-Master audio (the hi-rez bluray audio) is absolutly blocked. My TV and PC are not linked, therefore, media players like awsome VLC isn't helping on the TV end."
,Gacy8Gein,2013-06-07T19:44Z,"MPC-HC will just play the standard DTS or AC3 thru the Optical/SP-DIF/Analog no problem.
VLC should also, but I don't use it so can't verify.

DTS-HD and TrueHD are only possible thru HDMI.
Arcsoft Total Media Theatre supposedly can play the HD files, but I believe its still only thru the HDMI cable.
Otherwise the HDCP would be circumvented, which legally isn't allowed.
Only way to get HD audio is thru HDMI, into an HD capable Amplifier.
They aren't that expensive any more, less than 200 bucks. :)"
