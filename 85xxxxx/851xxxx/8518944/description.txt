Having taken their 14 month Forever Faithless greatest hits tour from Europe to South America, Russia and everywhere in between, the greatest dance band in the world are now releasing their first ever live DVD.

Despite continual demand for a live release, the band were determined to wait for the perfect venue and Alexandra Palace, London was the one.

Recorded on April 30th, 2005 at one of two sell out London shows. This release sees the culmination of 10 years of Faithless hits - anthems that have shaped and defined dance music around the world and sold in excess of 10 million records.

This DVD includes all the hits from the double platinum, #1 greatest hits album, Forever Faithless. It captures the essence of the mesmerising stage performance that has elevated Maxi Jazz, Sister Bliss and the Band to the only sell out stadium dance act in the world.

So if you want to re-live an amazing night out whenever you feel the urge or have never made it to a Faithless gig, this anthemic DVD is for you.
