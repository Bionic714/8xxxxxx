Soooo, may I respectfully ask, WHY the AC3 @384...???  You are talking about 1 FOURTH the bit rate of the DTS HD core that the BR comes with!

It's just that you go to SO much trouble to produce these excellent posts, WHY not just include the DTS core @1500...?  It doesn't take up that much room.  

WHY go to the trouble to DOWNGRADE the audio way down to an AC3 @384? at 1/4 the bit rate when you don't have to do so? When you can MUCH more simply just rip the DTS core...?

Sorry mate, not meaning to be rude or unappreciative, but I just don't get it...  : ("
