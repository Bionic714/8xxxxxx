,udidwht,2013-05-29T22:17Z,Avast detects a virus in setup.exe Win32:Malware-gen...I take it this is a false-positive?
,KevTheOne,2013-05-30T01:14Z,"In a key-gen it could be a false positive, actually that's what happens most of the time, but in the installer? ...really doubt it."

,anthillmob,2013-05-30T03:57Z,"Again, thanks very much for all your efforts in uploading fsx products to the Bay."
,maddog7777,2013-05-30T07:23Z,"If this is the same one that was released last month here on TPB, then yes it has a virus in it. I know kingashi would not deliberately pass along something with a virus in it. This is why I do not encourage people to download ripped versions unless you personally know the person who ripped it like Komu or DC_crack. I avoid ripped versions all together as it is very easy to inject and exe. I do not have an issue with rips that are just the files you copy and paste into the correct directories, but rips that actually contain and exe file can prove to be most dangerous to your systems. ""Just Saying"" Someone uploaded this about a month ago and I cannot remember who it was for the life of me, but that one did have a virus in the exe.... 
@udidwht- False positives are usually in keygens. If it was from the exe, then it most like is a virus/malware that was injected into the exe. I deleted the last Stuttgart-X that I got here on TPB. Hopefully this is not the same one...!"
