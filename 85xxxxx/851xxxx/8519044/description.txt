	   About the Game
	   ===============
	   
	   Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is an action-adventure stealth video game,
	   developed by Ubisoft Montreal and built on the Unreal Engine 2. It is 
	   the first Splinter Cell game in the series. The primary focus and 
	   hallmark of Splinter Cell's gameplay is stealth, with heavy focus on 
	   light and darkness. The player is encouraged to move through      
           the shadows for concealment whenever possible.
