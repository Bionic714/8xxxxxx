Paper is one of the best materials to craft with because it's everywhere. You can do paper crafts with computer paper, notebook paper, tissue paper, newspaper, and, of course, scrapbook paper. Scrapbooking and card making are increasingly popular pastimes for crafters, but lately people have been looking for other ways to craft with paper. After all, who wants to spend all that time perfecting a scrapbook layout only to have it shoved into a book and stored on a shelf? It's much more beneficial to display your crafts in your home! The benefits are twofold: you get to display the crafts that you toiled over (and you should be proud of them!) and you also get cheap, easy, and personalized home decor too, all just by doing something you love--paper crafting.
