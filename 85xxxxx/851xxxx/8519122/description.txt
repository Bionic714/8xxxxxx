The Blue Hawaiians are a surf-rock group from Los Angeles. They formed in 1994 to play at the opening of their friend Michelle's club, The Lava Lounge. They rose to fame soon thereafter due to the rise of one of their earliest fans, Quentin Tarantino, and an appearance on the soundtrack of the hit TV show Friends and the 1996 film Underworld. The group have since released several albums which have generally fared well with critics. The band also does music for the hit cartoon series SpongeBob SquarePants and their song The Cheat was featured in an advert for Guess Jeans. Current band members include: Mark Fontana, Erik Godal, Mark Sproull, Maxwellvision, Gary Brandin. The band are in a self-described ΓÇ£semi-hiatusΓÇ¥ but continue to play infrequent live shows, including appearances at the annual Tiki Oasis music festival.
