Santé has created a wonderful deep percussive based collection of loops and sounds featuring hypnotic tribal beats and deep subsonic bass lines topped off with warm organic melodies and atmospheres. All the tools are here to produce Deep Driving House and Techno productions filled with organic tones and natural swung grooves.

Berlin's Santé emerged as part of a wave of new producers with a different cut to their electronic jib around the time that deep house was losing its way somewhat. His productions ooze character, charisma, soul, colour, humour and above all a sense of humanity.
