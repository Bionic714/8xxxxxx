.. The Odd Numbers are without a doubt the best thing that ever came out of San Jose! screams a drunken haggered old drunk on a park bench, I should know I used to work for em! just then a mini van packed with all the Numbers gear pulls up and the band hop out run over and grab the drunkerd. its Rocko! and he's driving,! off on another wacky Odd Numbers adventure. the band has been together for over 15 years and played all over the world but that won't stop...
