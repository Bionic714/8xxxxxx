DecembeRadio is an American Christian rock band originally formed in 2003. Musically, DecembeRadio is heavily influenced by hard rock and blues-rock from the 1970s, owing to early exposure to family members' record collections. Their sound has been compared to that of Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, The Black Crowes and Lenny Kravitz, among others.
