V-7, very light and slightly blurry.  Also the top/bottom appear to be cropped a lot and the sides appear to be cropped a little.

A-8, clear and distinctive.  There may be some fall outs in the rest of the film but the sample audio depicts pretty good quality.

Overall rating, this is very watchable.  Thanks for the up!"
,iampatrickhi,2013-05-30T20:36Z,Not sure on the quality yet but just had to make reference to the seeders when I started download it was at  Seeders: 666 lol.
,iampatrickhi,2013-05-30T22:51Z,"Just finished downloading and what some-young-guy said is pretty accurate. almost like the person was sitting in the front row, but very watchable and pretty good for a cam. Thanks for the hard work."
