At the party, Chad and Angela talk intimately. They begin to date and Angela finds out she is pregnant. Angela, after finding out she is pregnant, falls in love with Chad, and he swears to take care of her and the child since he had an unstable childhood with an imprisoned mother and an unknown father, and was adopted. Through the course of the film, Angela sees Chad’s shortcomings, and their romance ends when Chad’s adoptive mother phones Angela’s mother and informs her of the pregnancy.
