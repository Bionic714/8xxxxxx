Trawlermen: Series 1
This gripping 5 part series follows the real-life dramas faced by Scottish trawlermen, as they undertake one of the most dangerous jobs in the world off the wild north east coast of Scotland. Every year lives are lost amid the Force 10 storms and 30 feet waves of the North Sea and the treacherous waters of the North Atlantic. This fascinating series focuses on the keen competition between the crew of the fishing boats as they risk their lives in ferocious storms in their desperate hunt for a profitable catch. This is the inside story of a brave yet largely unsung industry


1)  The Great Prawn Hunt 
Prawn trawler Amity is in a storm, 100 miles from shore, and the nets are caught on the seabed.

2)  The Storm 
Skipper Jimmy Buchan must decide whether to run to port through a storm or try and ride it out

3)  The Edge 
Ocean Venture has headed north and is fishing at The Edge, only 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Having failed to catch enough fish, skipper John Buchan is taking a huge risk in the deep and treacherous waters of the North Atlantic in a bid to find the perfect catch. With the previous night's storm over, Amity gets back to the business of trying to catch prawns.

4)  Starting Out 
Offshore fishing, the most dangerous job in Britain, has a problem when it comes to getting new recruits. But 17-year-old Ryan wants to take up the challenge. He sets out on his first trip on one of the most successful pair of trawlers in Britain as they head into the rough Norwegian waters looking for cod and haddock. If he doesn't impress skipper Kevin West, he'll be looking for a new job when they come back to port.

5)  Coming Home 
Jimmy, skipper of the prawn boat Amity, is 100 miles offshore fishing in one of the most hazardous areas of the North Sea - the Devil's Hole. The engines which bring in his nets are on the brink of failing - if they stop he'll have to cut loose his nets and return to port with no prawns and no pay. 80 miles away, new boy Ryan is desperate to impress skipper Kevin West, but time is running out for him to show he's tough enough.
