NOTE:

 Kelly Andrew brings you this energy-packed, epic, and dramatic release of riveting and gripping uplifting trance. The release begins with the Original Trance Mix, which sets the tone, energy level, tension, and emotion with its rising melodic lines and increasing pad layers. The song breathes at the break, which introduces a catchy main melody carrying the tune the rest of the way with poise and determination.
 Like the Original Trance Mix, the Epic Orchestral Trance Mix takes a similar approach, using a full-blown orchestra at the break, setting an epic tone for the remainder of the piece. Both mixes deliver a wonderful harmonic blend of epic orchestral and uplifting trance that will leave the listener in awe after an intense epic uplifting experience.
