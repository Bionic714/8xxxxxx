The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing Play Store. The cryptographic 

signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in 

any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can 

take weeks, download and install it just like any other APK and enjoy the new Play 

Store experience.
