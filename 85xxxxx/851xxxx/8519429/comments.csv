I"
,Who-He-iZ,2013-05-31T07:37Z,"^You can bet I have! Everything, nude pics and all. The early stuff made her The Legend. But, as you must know, i can't post them here. Censorship rules, Freedom is only a tune from the past... 1969 Woodstock etc. Now nerds try to rule, being just pathetic Hitler wannabees in the end. "

,Who-He-iZ,2013-06-01T06:38Z,"^ No problem. Just wanted to tell everyone how things are these days. A nerd hacker woman who was caught in the USA said when she was caught that: ""Hitler was a great man. He was just an underachiever"". 
Signs of the times ? Yes. I can maybe understand the younger nudes, but how in hell did these nerds make fully clothed 10-17 yo girls ""child porn"" that is really beyond my understanding. Googles y.o.u.tube is then bursting with ""child porn"" videos if i try to think like they do. It must be that too many hours every day in front of a computer makes them see everything through a porn lens, right ?"
