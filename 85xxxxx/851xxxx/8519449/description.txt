Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, May 29 transmission of The Alex Jones Show, Alex runs down globalist operative and frequent Bilderberg attendee Henry Kissinger's grotesque list of war crimes, as noted in We Are Change reporter Luke Rudkowski's on-camera confrontation with the Rockefeller protégé. 

Alex also continues hitting on Obama's array of scandals, while his administration tries to find ways to continue funding and arming Al-Qaeda in Syria. 

On today's show, political activist, radio talk show host and former marine Adam Kokesh joins Alex to discuss last week's arrest at a Philadelphia marijuana legalization rally and how it could affect his planned armed, but peaceful, march on Washington D.C. on July 4th. 

Also today, Alex welcomes author and activist Mark Dice to talk about his undercover videos exposing America's walking zombie-like mentality and utter state of apathy with anything political.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
