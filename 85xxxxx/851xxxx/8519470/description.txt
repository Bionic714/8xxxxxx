It can turn any file on your computer into a branded download page hosted on Dropbox.

It's a menubar icon. If you drop a file on it, it'll build a nice preview page around it, upload both to your Dropbox, then copy the public preview link to your clipboard. If you drop a folder on it, the folder will be zipped up before uploading.

News: 
[NEW] Actual preview images for your uploaded files. That means prettier preview pages with less fugly icons! (See below.)
[NEW] If you're brave, you can now subscribe to beta releases. Check your preferences and make sure to read the related blog post.
[NEW] Should the app crash for some reason, you'll have the option to send me an automated crash report at the next start. I'd really appreciate if you'd use that feature! 
[FIX] Fixed problems with stalled uploads. (Servus will now retry to upload failed chunks for a few times before giving up.)
[FIX] Adjusted hints text to reflect the changed submenus in the last release.
[CHG] Updated icons in Preferences.
[CHG] Updated the Dropbox SDK to 1.3.3.
[CHG] Cleaned up log messages. It's still incredibly verbose, that'll be changed in one of the next releases.
[CHG] Minor text changes here and there.
