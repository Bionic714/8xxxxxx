Old School New Rules, is as snarling, blunt, and self-assuredly political as any he has ever done. It's also the first release for his own independent Nashville-based record label, Bocephus Records, and it is indicative of how much Williams has taken over complete control of all aspects of his image, work, and career.

Williams has every right to preach his point of view on America and spout off on his personal politics, but when he turns things simpler and deeper and sings about love, pain, and drinking toward some sort of desperate redemption, he unites rather than divides. There aren't really any new rules on this album, just old-school honky tonk dressed up in shiny new boots. The dance is the same -- but who really wants to dance to politics? Luckily, about half the time here, Hank Williams Jr. is just another of our rowdy friends trying to get through a long Saturday night. (allmusic.com)
