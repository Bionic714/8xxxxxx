Saskias grandmother, Patricia (Miriam Margolyes) would give Hyacinth Bucket a run for her money and mum Alex (Harriet Walker) has successfully married into life in the Cheshire Set the English Beverley Hills.

Raif's present to the happy couple will be a video of their wedding. His film is our film the final edited version with music, live action, interviews - the works.
