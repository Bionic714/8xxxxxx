Kansas - The Ultimate Kansas [2002] [only1joe] FLAC

Epic/Legacy's double-disc set The Ultimate Kansas pretty much fulfills the promise of its title. Although it doesn't delve into the group's latter-day recordings for MCA and other labels, that's not a problem because most listeners ΓÇö whether they're fairweather or dedicated fans ΓÇö will want to concentrate on the group's peak in the '70s, which is precisely what this does. Over the course of 26 tracks, all the hits and album-oriented radio staples are featured, usually in their full-length album versions, plus a number of fan favorites and key album tracks that help draw a full picture of what the group did
