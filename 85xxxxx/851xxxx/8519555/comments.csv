the GOG Epic Edition version contains more content.. 
this Velvet Edition contains Two Worlds II + Addon...
GOG Epic Edition contains Two Worlds II + Addon+ Castle Defense + Bonus Materials"
,forgetit,2013-05-30T06:46Z,"Yeah, I get that, but other than a name or a label or the box it's shipped in, is the game itself any different? There's two gigabytes more, but that does not necessarily mean there's 2GB more of content, or does it?"
,forgetit,2013-05-30T06:48Z,@Machine4578: your  post did not show yet. But thanks for the info. No need to download this one then. :-)

the extra 2GB in PROPHET's release is the for multi language..
and yes, if you already have the GOG version you are good(btw both the GOG and PROPHET releases are v1.3.7)"
