These are fantastic boxes.  The only thing wrong is that there should be more of them - only three tracks after 1969.  Essential for Elvis fans.  I think I posted these some years ago.  There are lots of new faces here since then so they're worth putting back on the tracker.  New scans for Box 4 as I couldn't find any and I don't think I ever got around to them.  Boxes 1-3 are the original scans I did way back when.  Completely new rip.

Notes From Elvis On CD

The second of a series of four wonderful boxsets in an outstanding sound quality. Including a full color, 12 page booklet with pictures and recording session details.

Most tracks are previously released on other imports , but for someone who wasn't able to get a hold of these cds, this is a very welcome set.

Besides it's a limited edition, only 1000 editions were manufactured!
