Ghostbusters #04

They're BACK! The original boys in gray have escaped captivity, but their captors-the demonic entities know as the Collectors-aren't going to just let the Ghostbusters get away with a jailbreak! It'll take all the wits at the disposal of both teams to keep Ray, Peter, Winston and Egon in one piece and on this dimensional plane!
