If the 854x360 file was rendered to conform to the DVD standard, then yes, the height would be 480p (but the actual 2:35/1 format) would still be at 854x360p (with black bars hard coded into the file making it render at 854x480p)

If you look at wikipedia, you'll find references to this.

Since this file was not rendered to the 480p DVD standard, and instead, rendered not to DVD standard, the black bars (which would make it 480 pixels in height (with the black bars hard coded into the file) were not included, leaving 854x360p.

If the horizontal standard was used to understand this, then this file conforms to 480p via its 854 horizontal standards having been met.

So yes, according to DVD standard, the file is not ""480p"" formatted based on its height, but according to its width at 854 pixels, it falls within the 480p definition.

In any case, the dimensions are included in the media file info, for those needing exact specifications.

Thanks for noticing, because this took a while to digest when entering the final rendering stage.

Note, if the file was formatted to 480p DVD standard, the black bars, would force the viewer to see the media material with the black bars at all times.

If you watch this on VideoLan player, you will see it plays exactly at 854x360p vs. 854x480p which is annoying when one wants to adjust the player size during play because the black bars prevent resizing the video playback vertically.
