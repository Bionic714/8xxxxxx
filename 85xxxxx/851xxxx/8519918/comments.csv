"
,0zzjUoM9,2013-05-30T20:26Z,Just adjust adjust the audio sync. 0.25 seconds in PotPlayer did the trick for me.
,0zzjUoM9,2013-05-30T20:28Z,or maybe 0.35 seconds... tricky ^^
,0zzjUoM9,2013-05-30T20:35Z,try plus 0.35 seconds audio sync (for example in PotPlayer)
,0zzjUoM9,2013-05-30T20:44Z,hhmm.. or even 0.55 secs... i give up -_-
,Getabrain,2013-05-30T22:18Z,"No, you can't adjust the audio for the simple reason that the audio becomes more and more out of sync when you play the movie. 
This movie is cursed, it is not possible to find a good copy of it."

Click on my blue name and voilà there it is;)"
,Getabrain,2013-05-31T06:35Z,No anonymous. Your rip doesn't work properly and the picture quality isn't good enough.
,Getabrain,2013-05-31T07:28Z,The 10GB Russian/English version works properly and has a great picture quality. I cannot write the link because of the russian alphabet.
