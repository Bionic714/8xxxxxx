Stuart: A Life Backwards is a biography by Alexander Masters of his friend Stuart Shorter, formerly, at various times, a prisoner and a career criminal. It explores how a young boy, somewhat disabled from birth, became mentally unstable, criminal and violent, living homeless on the streets of Cambridge. As the title suggests, the book starts from Shorter's adult life, and works backwards to trace Shorter's through his troubled childhood, examining the effects his family, schooling and disability had on his eventual state.
