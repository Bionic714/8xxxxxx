,binderguy1,2013-05-30T04:43Z,"Thanks for the ul, STFmaryville!

Definitely a classic.  

I remember there being a sequel to Gotham by Gaslight by Augustyn and Barreto.  Might be worth an ul if there's a digital version."
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-05-30T05:06Z,"The sequel to this isn't bad and worth reading, but although I like Eduardo Barreto's art, they are no match to an inspired young Mike Mignola."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-30T05:27Z,"yeah Master of the Future did come out today, and hopefully Empire will release it as well."
,rakib2099,2013-05-30T12:10Z,STFmaryville can u give me the link of Burn Notice - First Contact v3 c07 (2012). Please............

[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-30T15:49Z,"here's the sequel to this Batman one-shot, everyone:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8521531"
,PM987,2013-05-31T01:47Z,"Thanks!  Own a copy of this but looking forward to seein the digital edition.

Would it be possible to post the newest and last Garth Ennis Battlefields series that ended last week? It's 3 issues long and called the Fall and Rise of Anna Kharkova. All the other Battlefields series are available in high quality scans on this website, most of which were posted by you I think.

Also, the first two issues of the new Ennis Dynamite series Red Team are on this site but the next two issues which have come out are not on the PB. Thanks! "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-31T11:40Z,"red team #3-#4 have not been published, that series is running very late. #3 is supposed to come out this wednesday.

always check shipJ's 0-Day Week torrents, they often have the dynamite comics that aren't posted individually.

battlefields #4 (anna kharkova part 1) was posted here:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8167237/  although it has the wrong subtitle in the file name, it's the one you want.

battlefields #5:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8336654/

and #6 (anna kharkova part 3):  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8475878/"
