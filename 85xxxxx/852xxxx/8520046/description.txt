Batman: Gotham by Gaslight

In an age of mystery and superstition, how would the people of Gotham react to a weird creature of the night, a bat-garbed vigilante feared by the guilty and the innocent alike?

The very first Elseworlds tale re-imagines the Dark Knight detective in Victorian times and pits him against the infamous murderer Jack the Ripper.

There are very few comics of the last 25 years that I would call "a classic" without hesitation. This is one of them. Released for the first time digitally by DC, this has one of the finest creative teams ever assembled for a prestige format one-shot, including Brian Augustyn (The Flash), Mike Mignola (Hellboy), and P. Craig Russell (Sandman).
