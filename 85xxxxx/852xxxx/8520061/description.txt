This American Life is a radio show from National Public Radio and a weekly podcast. Episode #454 "Mr. Daisey and the Apple Factory" detailed an actor Mike Daisey's experience going to China to see the conditions of the factories where Apple makes their products.  A few weeks later, however, it was discovered that Daisey had fabricated many details about the story.  The episode had been one of the most downloaded in TAL's but is no removed from their site because of the convtrovery. Episode #460, "Retraction," was released shortly after for TAL to directly deal with the issue.
