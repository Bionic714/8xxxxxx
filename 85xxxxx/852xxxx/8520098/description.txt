If, you're the owner of Rubik's Cube or a similar cube. you're probably finding that no matter how hard you try and how much time you spend fiddling with it, the cube still looks like a pile of colored confetti. What you need is a solution to this puzzle that is not only guaranteed to work but also is simple enough to under- stand even if you're not a mathematical genius.
The problem of restoring a cube to solid colors on all 6 faces is very difficult -far more difficult than near1y any other popular puzzle. As a result many available solutions are also so difficult that understanding them is no easier than solving the puzzle itself. The purpose of this book is to present a complete, quick. step-by-step solution that is both straightforward and effective. No knowledge of mathematics is assumed or necessary.
