Transformers: More than Meets the Eye #17 - Remain In Light

REMAIN IN LIGHT! MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE's first full-blown epic moves into high gear as RODIMUS leads his crew to the gates of heaven-or hell. But larger forces are closing in and an ancient plan is reaching fruition-and as an old friend calls time on the AUTOBOTS' quest, one thing becomes clear: the LEGISLATORS are on the march.
