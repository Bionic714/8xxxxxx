System will reboot only if Windows Loader is installed.

Changes:
-Stopped deleting the winsxs backup folder that I started doing
a couple months ago. It doesn't save hardly any room and it
prevents uninstall of certain kb files.
-added KB971033 to all indexes. RemoveWAT users take notice.
(You can uninstall through control panel if you wish)
-Moved .NET 4-4.5 redist and hotfix installs to a NET45 folder
on the ISO. You can install it with a simple click on the script
after install. (Actually installs about 50% faster post-setup)
-Actually remembered the network drivers this month. Sorry bout
April! (was not an April fool's joke, I just missed it)
-Added KMS reference text. You don't need to read it to use it.
(KMS is preferred when you have a problem with WinLoader)

All activated indexes allow updating and pass the
genuine check on Microsoft's website. I've added MS Security
Essentials folder and Redistributable installers to the ISO.

OEM-Activated Index is the same as Pre-Activated index except that
it tries to activate with the bios service licensing stuff that
OEM manufacturers use. If it cannot find an appropriate licensing
solution, it will install Windows Loader 2.2.1 using default install
options. Refer to the MDL project page for multi-branding for more
info. Also feel free to give Daz and CODYQX4 a "Thanks" for their
great activators. Most Retail motherboards require a special flash
to allow installing these SLP. Use at your own risk if you dig them
up on MDL.

(THX CODYQX4 and Daz!)
