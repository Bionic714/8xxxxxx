,kwakamungus,2013-06-01T09:26Z,Dose this work with the steam version?
,peterdek,2013-06-01T15:37Z,"Thank you!!! this dlc is awesome, and it works pefrectly. Allthought there is one thing that is annoying. I dont know if it is the dlc like this or boecouse is  a pirate o copy or what but when i play pagans (except scandinavian) the council is the catholic one. The priest shows like the monk with the cross in his hands. I will really apreciate if u can take a look of this matter, maybe i did something wrong or the dlc is like this. "
,peterdek,2013-06-01T15:50Z,"Thanks. The dlcs works pefectly. However all tha pagans council, except the norse one, show like the catholic one. The priest is the monk with the cross in his hands, i dont know if i did something wrong or the dlc is like this but is quite annoying and less realistic."
,peterdek,2013-06-01T15:51Z,sorry for that connection problems
,Eliijahh,2013-06-01T16:34Z,"I don't understand where to put them. If I install the repack it doesn't work, since the 1.10 patch is incompatible with it. With skidrow the same. Which base game should I download to make this DLC pack work?"
,arcanjo90,2013-06-02T05:51Z,"Hello, first i would like to thank you, everything is working fine =]

And for the people who is trying to make it work with the Crusader Kings 2 REPACK SxSxl, it works FINE, here is how i did it:

1- You have to download the version 1.092, and 1.10, just google it and you get a link. 

2 - Then you have to put it in the right folder, mine was going Program Files (86x)/Crusader Kings 2 Repack/Crusader kings 2; it was instaling inside the folder so the game is not really uploaded, you have to make it install on the root (crusader kings repack)

3- Follow the rules from the ""readme""(put the dlcs on the dlcs folders, activate it and done!)"
,macoson,2013-06-02T15:40Z,"It doesnt work :(
I did everything like in readme but game run without DLCs activated. Activator crashed at start of loading screens"
,macoson,2013-06-02T18:19Z,it works when I did activation and rest offline
,T3st1fy,2013-06-03T04:35Z,It does work with the skidrow release as long as you install skidrow update two and then install 1.10 patch followed by the rest of the steps
,T3st1fy,2013-06-03T04:36Z,also dynasty portraits 3 or whatever it was called again is not out yet probably soon though
,iHustleu,2013-06-05T03:00Z,Can you upload a Crusader Kings 2 complete sort of thing. I'm having trouble updating crusader kings 2 for this torrent and don't think I will be able to. If you could upload an ISO that is already updated and has all the dlc's that would be great.
,tinygiantz,2013-06-05T04:45Z,this is missing a coat of arms pack which i'm fairly sure will give you odd coats of arms everywhere.
,tinygiantz,2013-06-05T06:59Z,"if you use skidrow's release +1.10 you will get the wrong coat of arms, but with the sxsxl repace you will get the correct coat of arms. use arcanjo90's instructions."
,T3st1fy,2013-06-06T16:41Z,what to you mean? what is wrong with the coat of arms using skidrow release? 
,Janek1Slav,2013-06-07T13:54Z,"Hello thank you for the torrent it works great. 

When do you think the next patch will be on the bay?
"
,AnonymousCrusader,2013-06-08T03:16Z,"I am crashing as soon as the Loading Database Screen Appears whenever i try DLC activator , and after that when i try to start the game via normal launcher it just says C++ Redistubutable abnormal program termination .... someone might be enough kind hearted to give me advice here?
Oh and yes i have installed all the patches in a right sequence , up to the 1.10"
,Janek1Slav,2013-06-09T11:52Z,"You need to re install your,just re install your operating system if you can and next time have 2 petitions or if you do then re installing your pc is the easiest solution."
,Janek1Slav,2013-06-09T11:53Z,Re install your C++ Redistubutable or reinstall yuor os. Its not the game its your computer.
,C0YGQ7,2013-06-11T20:35Z,"Hello everibody!! :D
Maybe this is a stupid question but I have a little problem!
-I installed the skidrow release and the 1 and 2 upgrade for it!
-I have also installed the 1.06,1.08.1.091,1.092, and the 1.10 patch!
-I have put the DLC folder and the activator into the right folder, to the install directory!
- When I run the activator it is crashing as soon as it begin to load, not when it reaches flags or what!
-It would be not a problem becouse it is expected, and the game launch without a problem but the dlc doesen't! I can click or unclick any of the dlc's but they doesent appear to work!
-So my question is that how can i make it work, and of course do i need internet connection to activate! 
(Sorry for my english) Thx for advance!! :D:D"
,iHustleu,2013-06-12T20:01Z,How to update patch for illegitimate copy of CK2?
,vetiarvind,2013-06-13T16:35Z,"How do you update to 1.10 if you already have a cracked copy? I tried updating, but it can't find the folder I've installed CK2 on. Someone upload a cracked version of 1.10 please."
