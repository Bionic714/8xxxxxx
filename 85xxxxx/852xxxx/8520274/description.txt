Please Read Slightly Updated Read-Me if you have not used one of my DLC torrents before or if you have troubles... Important to replace ALL DLC with what is in the torrent not just the new ones they updated some of the older dlcs i guess.. I am not sure exactly which ones... I will only be seeding for a day or two so please seed if you do not want this torrent to die right away.. thank you and enjoy! :)

Oh! And just because I KNOW someone is going to ask YES this is ALL dlc as of today (5-29-13)  Let me know in the event I messed the torrent up if anything is missing..
