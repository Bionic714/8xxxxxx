I collected all of the expansions and store content from various sources.  (See below)  I've also included nude packs and made sure that the University schedule bug was fixed before releasing this for everything.  (The bug was where the class schedule was empty and it was caused by a couple store fixes.  I placed the broken "fixes" in a separate directory so that they don't fix your game to a non-working state.)

I also made a nude clothing package that works for everyone and for every clothing option.  Plus, I made sure that all installation content is in ISO format and numbered in the series you need to install it in.  The instructions I wrote will give you a detailed walk through of installing your game so that everything works correctly.

Island Paradise will be the next expansion and that comes out at the end of June 2013.  You'll probably want to get that one as well.  Also, in fall of 2013, you can grab the "Untitled Futuristic Pack" and in September, the Movie Stuff Pack will be released.

The Sims 3 and all expansions and store content was created by EA.  Most
people can't afford to pay the rich people to get richer, so that's why
people use P2P and help each other.  If you do have the money to pay them
to get richer, support their development by buying these games.  I do that
when I have the money.  When I can barely afford to eat, I use torrents.
