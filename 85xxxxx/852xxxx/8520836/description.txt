Star Trek Into Darkness 2013 TS READNFO XViD - JUSTiCE



SOURCE : HiGHLiFE 720p  AUDIO : A Good Friend / OFFLiNE


Video and audio both cleaned and given justice.
Check sample and see.....


Right thought i'd give users a different choice here ...so far at the time of writing this
most if not all grps have gone with the PSO german video muxed with line.
Soooo opted to do the highlife 720p cam for the video and used offlines line audio as it was better
imho.
Firstly the video ....pretty good and inc the english subs when needed.Also its the ONLY full video out
and is 1min longer than the pso release.
Downside ...there was some really heavy glare on it and made the faces sometimes look like casper the ghost.

Audio ...decent line audio with some slight hiss to it that was sometimes louder in parts but overall decent stuff.

For the video i cleaned it up,changed the brightness,contrast levels....touched down the glare and resized.
There is a head at the bottom of the screen in parts but nothing major and didn't want to cut due to the fact you would
lose some of the subs when needed.
Audio was cleaned and remastered in adobe ....after it was syncd to our encode.
Now because we never had the source audio file we could only sync what audio we had ....and like i said the pso is missing
video so had to fill the gaps with the cam audio we used on our first star trek release.
in total there is about 4mins worth of cam audio ...due to missing line and some sync issues.

Overall pretty decent TS and being honest both this and the pso videos have faults ....so pick ya poison.
