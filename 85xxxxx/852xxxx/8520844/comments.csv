Thanks!"

BUT, there are no English subtitles, so I'll go and try to find some.

Thanks anyway...

You MIGHT want to include that in the information the next time; just a suggestion.

Cheers!"

BUT...  The film is not in English; it is is French or Flemmish.  So, if you DO happen to find English subtitles, that would be GREAT!!!

THANKS!!!"
