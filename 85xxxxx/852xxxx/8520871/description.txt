I set up this pack for people who might be new to the Android community. It has all of the most popular hacks and mods along with simple explained out instructions. I didn't create any of the programs nor did I come up with any of these methods. I just organized them and put simple instructions in each folder so that everything would be in one place and to simplify the process for some of the newer members who this is their first time messing around with any device.
