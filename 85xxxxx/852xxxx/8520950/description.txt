Hello, please read to avoid Downloading the same files twice. :)


Every month (so far) i've been uploading my anime/japanese music for you to listen to!

When i upload the newest month, i include all the previous months IN the torrent file to avoid them dying out on me.
So you don't have to worry about missing a month cuz they're all in one place!
So here is how you download the new month WITHOUT downloading the previous months (assuming) you have :P


- When you open the torrent file in bit/utorrent or W/e you use. untick the previous months that you already have and begin download!


- if you don't get an option to choose what folders to download, here is how you turn it on!

- Go to options and choose preferences and go to the tab "UI Settings"
- You have to tick the option that says "Show a window that displays the files inside the torrent" Apply and OK
- Now remove the torrent and re-add the torrent, now the display will show and choose your months!
- (optional) lastly go to thepiratebay ORand thank me in the comments ^^

 

check back every few months for new tracks!!


- note!

The list is entirely subjective, i only add music I like to my collection.. so if you're into the chipmonk/high pitch japanese music this torrent ain't for you :p
