LOVE this series, thanks a lot... was a pretty big part of the BBS generation, authored, along with a few others ""IMAGE BBS"" for the C=64 back in the late 80s.  This is bringing back a lot of memories and fun seeing some of the people I knew and met as a result.  I had no idea this was out, or even in production.  Thanks Again.

Any chance of the last two parts showing up?  (hint-hint)
