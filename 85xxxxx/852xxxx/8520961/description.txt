Part of a long string of blockbuster racing games (including TOCA Championship Racing, Pro Race Driver and the original Grid), Grid 2 challenges players to be fast, be first and be famous as they enter a stunning new world of competitive motorsport. Following the success of Race Driver: Grid -- which set new standards for damage, AI, visuals and introduced the Flashback time rewind feature (now adopted by many racing games) -- Grid 2 will again raise the gameplay and technological bar for motorsport gaming and remain true to the series' core value -- it's all about the race. Grid 2 will also introduce the new TrueFeel Handling System, which uses real physics to hit a sweet spot between accessibility and simulation to deliver handling that is approachable yet challenging to master.

Going behind the wheel of a handpicked selection of automotive icons spanning four decades and three continents -- USA, Europe and Asia -- players will race their way to the top of Grid 2's new, evolving world of motorsport. From Paris to Dubai, Miami to the sun-kissed California coast and beyond, beautifully created city streets, licensed circuits and edge-of-control mountain roads will become home to the most visceral and exhilarating races in games. Grid 2 also sets new standards for a racing multiplayer experience with an entirely distinct and extensive gameplay component and unique progression system. Deep customization options and integration with RaceNet will offer further immersion and connectivity to extend each playerΓÇÖs GRID 2 experience.
