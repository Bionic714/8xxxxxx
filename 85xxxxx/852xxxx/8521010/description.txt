Plebs is a British television series, broadcast on ITV2. It was first broadcast in March 2013, and is produced by Tom Basden, Caroline Leddy, Sam Leifer and Teddy Leifer. It stars Joel Fry, Tom Rosenthal and Ryan Sampson, who play young residents of ancient Rome. The format has been compared to that of British sitcom, The Inbetweeners, and also to Blackadder.

Ancient Rome is traditionally imagined as the home of emperors and senators, generals and gladiators, and a dignified theatre of pomp and ceremony. Plebs follows the lives of three desperate young men from the lower classes as they try to participate in sexual intercourse, hold down jobs and climb the social ladder in the big city. Two are free men: Marcus and Stylax, who work in a scriptorium; the third leading character, Grumio, is their lazy slave with an attitude problem.
