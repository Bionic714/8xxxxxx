You must be a real fan to upload this kind of stuff.
I'm a real fan too but that recording has the worst sound I ever heard about Wagner.
Well, of course it's 1943...

I was listening to this when my ears got blue and suddenly I cut it off and started listening to Karajan's 1972 DG recording. I felt a lot better.

Don't take it bad because I really appreciate your uploads. I even emailed TPB and suggested they give you some kind of skull but never got any reply.

Well, in my opinion you're a very reliable uploader and I am glad to thank you for the musics (classical and jazz) you upload, even lousy recordings like that one.

Thank you connor17."
