,Smux,2013-06-09T11:13Z,"Hey my download went great up until 78%, and then just stopped, with red bars filling in the missing parts...I don't know exactly how all this works, but it seems like it just can't find those parts or something; any chance anyone could give me some advice/put the full file up for seeding just for a short time (a couple hours should do it), etc.??"
,Smux,2013-06-09T11:48Z,I'll happily seed it afterward whenever I'm online :-)
