[V],globeplus,2013-06-01T13:39Z,"To Mr143srv : well the wish is always that the multiplayers works but for this versions of the games presented here at piratebay it is rare see them working specially without problems or inconveniences to the users , so it is a kind of illusion to got multiplayers working on this game versions ... happy game to you ...

[V],globeplus,2013-06-04T01:13Z,"To Yakkodori : i don´t know who you are or what you pretend with your strange observation but i am telling you : CAREFULL with your language , you hear me ? because i am uploading nice files with correct sharing spirit for a few years now and never had intention for a single moment to give any virus to anyone on any file , if it happen sometime , if... was because the effort from the guys that make the cracks that because the normal hard work many times on the worked executables they can get false positive virus indications but they don´t make that with intention too and they say to stop the firewall or disable the antivirus before try the applied worked executable ... if you don´t have the correct sense about the generality of the uploaded files here on this site don´t insult or disrepect without a real motive anyone got it ? because that it is not true and you simply don´t have a clue about what you are saying ... long live this site and his correct sharing spirit and it is an example for any torrents site , i confess that i´d like to see more users on my rip files but i can guarantee to you that my work is honest and absolutly safe to the users ... i hope god be with you and iluminate your spirit before you say things that you aren´t shore about it ... happy files to all of you ...

[V],globeplus,2013-06-04T01:30Z,"Hi gain and this comment is to make another observation about rip files , to get the full games with everything are probably many files with originals , that certainly positive and it is ok that happen but who use the originals knows that more hard disc space is beeing occupied by the downloaded game , on the rips you still get all the essencial gameplay but the space on the hard disc will be probably much less , for example after 10 games downloaded , who uses original can spend 50 or more giga on the hard disc space and who download rip versions probably spent half of that , how this can happen ? because things that really aren´t necessary to the gameplay are removed or files that can be worked after tests shows normality inside the games and great precompression and compression work when it is possible ... that´s it ... i respect who get originals but they really spents more hard disc space , using rips it is just another possible option that the generality of the users can have ... happy files to all of you ..."
