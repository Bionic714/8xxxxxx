About the Game:

Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV.
Contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony.
Unlike the downloadable versions of the episodes, the compilation does not require a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV to play, nor is an Xbox Live or PlayStation Network account necessary.
The Lost and Damned features similar gameplay to Grand Theft Auto IV. It is mainly the story of a biker from the motorcycle club "The Lost" and how he progresses.
The player is also able to telephone various members of the Lost to provide assistance. 
Terry, for instance, will drive to a location near to Johnny and sell him weapons and armor, while Clay can deliver a bike of the player's choice to a nearby area. 
Another addition to The Lost and Damned is gang wars.
The Ballad of Gay Tony follows the exploits of a new protagonist, Luis Fernando Lopez, an associate of a Dominican street gang, and the personal bodyguard of Anthony "Gay Tony" Prince. 
Rockstar Games claim in their press release that this episode "injects Liberty City with an overdose of guns, glitz, and grime" and that players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends, 
and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price......
