I mean i don't get it , what's with all the hype about iron man , whether its the movies or comics.
I totally dislike Iron Man , 
he is boring , 
looks like an uncle in that french cut beard.
& i hate his stupid iron armour, as in a cartoon show i  found him suffocating in the armour after he crashed from a blow. . . and all the rest of the marvel superheroes were saying - quick , he needs air , remove his iron mask. lol


Batman is way cooler and more smart too. lol"
