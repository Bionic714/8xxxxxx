London-based artist Dean Blunt presents his first official solo LP, The Redeemer, released on April 30th,2013 via his own World Music imprint and Hippos in Tanks. The Redeemer follows his 2012 solo introduction The Narcissist II, which was a narcotic ode to an unspecified 'girl'. The Redeemer proceeds with a yet more direct and heartfelt message, and a notable lifting of the veil of tape hiss and blurred signifiers that characterized Blunt's previous work, both solo and with Inga Copeland as Hype Williams.
