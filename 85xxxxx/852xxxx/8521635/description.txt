Director: Paulo Cesar Saraceni

The down-at-the-heels aristocrats in this Brazilian film can barely keep their moral compasses on an even keel at the best of times. When one of the women of the family throws herself wholeheartedly into a life of passion and eroticism, they haven't a clue what to do. As they begin to find ways to attack her, her defenses are strengthened by a new alliance with a wily and resourceful transvestite.
