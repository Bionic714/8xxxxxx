POtHS Comments on This one......... There is truth here for all ages and beliefs. If Darwin was wrong...........then the Schools have been intentionally lying to our Children. If the schools teach Darwinism which says there is NO CHRIST. Then they are of The Anti-Christ. Public Schools teaching books CHANGE EVERY YEAR. The Bible never changes. So where is truth??? In Evolution Theories??? If you believe in Evolution you are denying The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit of the Praise They are entitled too for making everything you understand and can see and more than that, everything you don't understand and can't see. If you have never thanked the CREATOR for his Creation now is your chance to thank Him.

John Sanford on Down - Not Up (Lecture on 2-4-2012 at Loma Linda University):
John Sanford, from Cornell University, is the inventor of the "gene gun" among other ways to get foreign genes into cells. His studies into genetics led him to conclude that natural selection was unable to purify the genome, let alone create new complex genetic designs. He also concluded that large, slowly breeding animals like humans and elephants could not last for millions of years without direct Divine intervention, and he is thus a short-age creationist. He wrote a book called Genetic Entropy and the Mystery of the Genome (2005) explaining his reasoning.

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.
