2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As always, please do the right thing by supporting the artists and their ongoing ministry by purchasing those albums you intend on enjoying.  Please strengthen the ministry by torrenting a little longer than you perhaps might otherwise would here on The Pirate Bay.  Please grow the ministry by sharing some of this music with your family, friends, coworkers, etc.  And most of all, please pray for the ministry.
