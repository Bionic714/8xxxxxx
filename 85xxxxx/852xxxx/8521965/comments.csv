,frostyon420,2013-05-30T20:52Z,Well I navigated my way to the settings and the only language loaded in this game is German.  So good luck guys
,madmax2k92,2013-05-30T21:09Z,can any1 say if this works.. 1 person said its in German.. can the language be changed?
,CanadianPsycho,2013-05-30T21:21Z,Thanks Mr.Stifmeister!!!!
,frostyon420,2013-05-30T21:25Z,I already confirmed before ur post it only has German loaded in ot
,mackaparen,2013-05-30T21:31Z,its in german but it works. everything is in german and i hate it i will wait for an english version.
,madmac01,2013-05-30T21:48Z,"To change the language from German to English :
Open the steam_rld file ,which is in the directory were Wargane Airland Battle is installed ,with notepad.
Change the last line is the file ,which reads Language=german to Language=english.
Now the game is in English."
,madmac01,2013-05-30T21:51Z,"To change the language from german to english :
Open the steam_rld file ,which is in the installation directory ,with notepad.
Now change the last line in this file ,which reads Language=german to Language=english.
Now the games default language is English."
,czesiu_84,2013-05-30T22:01Z,"Yup, german only"
,740gl,2013-05-30T22:51Z,"JUST READ WHAT MARMAC01 WROTE.
That fixes the language issue.
I didn't believe it but it was that simple."
,frostyon420,2013-05-31T00:38Z,The German to english fix did the trick. Thanks guys
,nignug,2013-05-31T01:45Z,"I love how many people give up just because the language isn't correct. What people fail to realize is the main release of most games contain multiple languages. Yes, the default is German, but it can be changed. Open the steam file, and change the language inside from German to English. Case closed."
,Cassianogpaiva,2013-05-31T03:11Z,"Hey there!

Everytime I try to launch the game I have this message: 

""Critical error: Unable to create graphic device. Reason: ChangeMode failure ""

Any Ideas on what can be causing this..?"
,moeburn1,2013-05-31T04:09Z,"hey i don't know if anyone noticed this yet, but for some reason whoever cracked this decided to set the language to german in the steam_rld.ini.  It's an easy fix, just change language=german to whatever you want."
,FreeGameFreak77,2013-05-31T04:36Z,Who's next to say they found the German Language Fix again without Reading the previous comments of the same nature....
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-05-31T04:53Z,Can you upload Rising Storm?

,RandomBS,2013-06-03T18:05Z,"@moeburn1 Thanks for the info 

@PurelyEpic, just google the game and you get everything you need to know, also, you just came randomly searching for a game? I thought that all people that downloaded a torrent knew what the game was about.

THE GAME WORKS fine, but somehow I'm not being able to put it in english, but i'm working on that.

Thanks Mr.Stifmeister."
,legryf,2013-06-03T19:29Z,"@RandomBS: easy to change the language; after installing and copying the cracked files edit the file named steam_rld.ini, scroll down and where it reads ""Language=german"" change to ""Language=english"". You can also edit the screen name from RLD to whatever you want.

,BAWxMURDOCHx,2013-06-03T21:47Z,When I try to move the steam.api file it tells me I need permission from all users and I don't have permission to move it. I don't see how it makes any sense seeing as how I'm the only user of this computer and I'm the administrator. Windows 7 by the way.
,CFJack,2013-06-04T12:57Z,"@BAWxMURDOCHx:

on Win7 there is a folder called GAMES. Right click on that folder and select properties, then go to SECURITY and hit EDIT for all users, one by one, checking the boxes in lower window. When done, proceed with installation but point the wizzard to GAMES folder. That should fix it."
