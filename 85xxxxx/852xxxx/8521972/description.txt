Last year, Jack White's first solo album offered a cover of Little Willie John's I'm Shakin'. This year, Willy Moon's does the same ΓÇô and offers a microcosm of their differing approaches. White's version was jumping but respectful; Moon's puts a scratchy guitar line atop juddering drum-machine beats, while he quavers and hollers the vocal line in 50s fashion. In fact, that's more or less what he does across the album. Sometimes ΓÇô as on the single I Wanna Be Your Man ΓÇô there's a little bit more going on, something other than his voice to carry some melody, and there's a cleverness to the onomatopoeic percussion of Working for the Company, which sounds like a production line. However, older listeners will be transported straight to the 80s by this rockabilly/technology fusion ΓÇô not just because the beats are so purposely clumsy, but because Here's Willy Moon sounds far less like a fusion of Elvis and urban than it does Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Westworld, who had exactly the same idea nearly 30 years ago.
