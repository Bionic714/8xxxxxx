,ben7530,2013-05-30T21:28Z,"I'm suspicious about any game that can't translate its title better than this...

It's the ""Super happy smile family fun wish time RTS!!!!"""
,madmax2k92,2013-05-30T23:22Z,yea but is it working
,daterxies,2013-05-31T01:11Z,"Works, but is in German"
,daterxies,2013-05-31T01:15Z,"Actually as pointed out in another torrent

To change the language from German to English :
Open the steam_rld file ,which is in the directory were Wargane Airland Battle is installed ,with notepad.
Change the last line is the file ,which reads Language=german to Language=english.
Now the game is in English. 


Tested and works."

Never had a problem with RELOADED torrents so I'm assuming it's not malicious but it's still annoying."

,huntersteel,2013-06-01T22:48Z,found a solution that works for the missing msvcp110.dll : at the end of the setup check the 3 boxes and install all 3 ( 2 of them are microsoft visuals c++ thay u will need ) wich will give you the missing .dll file .
