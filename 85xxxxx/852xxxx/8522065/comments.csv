Anyone got one to post?"
,Laci4465,2013-05-31T01:08Z,"As described above, it this pdf is ""as it can be printed"" for subscribers of the digital edition - I also like the full-page pdf better, but actually, the quality i.e. resolution of those is the same (they are just zoomed out to eliminate the margins while worsening the sharpness at the same time). The file size also reflects this fact.
If anyone posts here how to that ""full-paging""in a pdf, I will try it myself.
And -of course- no other copy is available, I posted my work for this very reason for those who do not want to wait."
