San Francisco's Tea Leaf Green have finally harnessed their considerable live mojo into a gorgeously sculpted studio counterpart that reflects the quintet's bounteous creativity, instrumental dexterity, and dedicated songwriting chops. This is an album in the classic sense, a wide spectrum journey one takes knowing steady hands will stir one through the shifting currents. Co-produced by Jeremy Black (Apollo Sunshine) at Oakland's increasingly hot Coyote Hearing Studio, In The Wake wriggles and glows with life, a chronicle of survivors thriving through myriad challenges, the bubbling product of a rugged, dented determination to seek beauty and truth in a song.
