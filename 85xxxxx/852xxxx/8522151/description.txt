I want to share it because mainly this album is awesome, even though they only released one album but this album really is a bomb.

Don't mind the lyrics too much if you're not comfortable, the music tells how good it is.

The encodings are all 128kbps, sorry guys because it was hard to find a good quality one, if anyone found this message and owns a better quality, leave your comments with your link or anything could possibly to get the high quality.

Also, the songs are slightly abruptly cut on the beginning and end of the songs, probably less than 2 seconds. Other than that, I re-tagged all the tracks properly.

Well, enjoy the good music!
