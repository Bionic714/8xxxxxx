,Sapphyreopal5,2013-05-30T18:39Z,"Note that this edition also does NOT have colored diagrams (only the atlas contains colored pictures) as some versions of this manual apparently do. There is no way to know if the manual does or doesn't have the colored diagrams unless it's specifically in the seller description or are able to see for yourself. Some people in my class bought it in the school book store and ended up with colored diagrams throughout the manual.
