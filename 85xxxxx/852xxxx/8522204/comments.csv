,Rizzo220,2013-06-01T02:51Z,Yeah... what he said...
,free4last,2013-06-01T12:46Z,Update which one?
,Dr. Howard,2013-06-01T18:34Z,"If you notice, this is an update, so you need to have Battery 4 already installed.. Also, I had to batchmod the stand alone for this update.. haven't checked the plugins yet..."
,Dr. Howard,2013-06-01T18:42Z,AU also works fine in Logic
,Svenson44,2013-06-01T23:33Z,"@Dr. Howard: No kidding! Yes, I know how to read, but this does not answer our question, replace WHAT, WHERE?"
,Dr. Howard,2013-06-02T00:42Z,"well, if you downloaded this, you'd find a replacement for what you had already installed: Stand Alone, AU, VST, and DPM ...

I take it you know where these live, right?"
,skizzolfs,2013-06-02T18:30Z,"is a virtual instrument, in this case of batteries.
you use to make music with programs that use:
  VST (cubase or other editor)
  au (logic or tools)
RTAS. (protools)
these three (VST, AU, RTAS) plug-ins are.
exploited by many software, but always in the field of music or audio.

This update (4.0.2) without the previous relase installed does not help, missing audio libraries ..

ciao ciao ;)"

,Dr. Howard,2013-06-04T02:29Z,"@skizzolfs - as mentioned, this is an update. One has to first install Battery 4, and, yes, the library is available if you look for it - for the record, I still like Battery 3 and it's libraries better  hehe
Battery 4 does have a cool interface though"
,Chuky013,2013-06-04T12:07Z,This is an update !!!!
