============================

This is my personal selection of old dubstep tracks. I had a hard time searching these and I selected only
the best ones. You on the other hand can have all these great tracks with 1 mouse click.

Share the sub.
============================

A SubWoofer is required ! (seriously don't try listening these tracks without one..)

These tracks are great for testing your car's subs ;-D

============================

Most of the tracks are from  Γëê 2006. This is as HD as things can get. Want better ? Buy the original tracks
(most of them were vinyl so you won't find them anymore)
