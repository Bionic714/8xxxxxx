Wargame: AirLand Battle is the real-time strategy game sequel to Wargame: European Escalation, developed by Eugen Systems and published by Focus Home Interactive


A total of 150 planes will be added, from fighters to bombers to electronic warfare planes. AirLand Battle will also introduce four new nations of Canada, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to existing eight nations of the NATO and Warsaw Pact factions, making a total of over 750 vehicles and combat units.
There will be a new weapons system, better handling of fire effects, and a new Urban Combat Interface (UCI) allowing for battle inside cities.

The game will feature jet aircraft as a new unit type in gameplay, allowing players to build up their own air force. To allow this feature to be properly implemented, the IRISZOOM Engine has been improved to include bigger maps, and more specifically, maps with higher altitude and verticality, allowing for large mountain ranges and valleys to add to the Scandinavian landscape.


Eugen Systems announced that the story will continue the NATO-Warsaw Pact war at a turning point of the Cold War in 1981. The war rages in Northern Europe, notably Scandinavia, whose architecture and landscape are recreated in the game.
Players could play either as the NATO forces to fend off the Warsaw Pact's invasion, or the Warsaw Pact to conquer Scandinavia.
