,girodice,2013-06-06T15:30Z,"Just a tip to guys who have downloaded her earlier Jackpot files (1 to 7) through this older torrent: 

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7393984/Isabella_Valentine_Jackpot_Series#filelistContainer

There is no need to download ALL the files again. Just download 8 and 9 by clicking 'Properties' setting and checking which files to download. 

Afterwards, you can copy files of Jackpot 1-7 into this torrent's download folder, and use 'Set Location' (in transmission, somehwat similar in other clients I am sure) to rebuild and voila, you have the full torrent and can now seed all the files as well!

As an aside, I must say the audio quality of Isabella has gone down in Jackpot 8 and 9. The decline started around Jackpot 7, but is very noticale in these latest two files. Her voice sounds so thin and cheap, as if she recorded these with some cheap $5 USB headset on a laptop.

Earlier Jackpot files sound so much richer. I also notice that Jackpot 7-9 are 32000 Hz sample rate, instead of 44100 Hz she used earlier. Clearly she does not know what she is doing, audio wise. Shame.

Anyway, thanks methrend. I'll be seeding this for a looong time.

When you copy and paste the files from the old torrent location, you will have to rename them. You can see which filenames to use in the torrent properties.
