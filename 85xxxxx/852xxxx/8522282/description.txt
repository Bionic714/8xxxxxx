Holder of numerous awards and accolades, the Swapper is  an  atmospheric
puzzle platformer set in the furthest reaches of  space.  Players  wield
an experimental device able to clone the user and swap  control  between
them. Dropped into a character and world as mysterious as  the  workings
of the device itself, The Swapper is a game of  exploration  of  a  very
personal nature

All of the art in The Swapper is constructed using clay models and other
everyday materials

The Swapper is supported by Indie Fund
