,Callvyn,2013-05-31T00:30Z,"so its not a real Green Lantern v1-v5 its all the events from V1 to V5 because i see superman, batman, action comics and flash comics in here but i don't are a lot of numbered green lantern comics going from 1 to what ever number they ended in. the earliest green lantern comics i see are V2 nice torrent but its way too big to sort out all the crazy numbering that was done here."
,ChingaTuu,2013-05-31T00:37Z,"...I normally don't seed the non-PD stuff, but this one I'll make an exception for. Mothra posted the GA GL collection a few weeks back, so it'll be interesting to see which is more complete."
,Mothra67,2013-05-31T06:55Z,"Since I mainly do only GA stuff, and this doesn't seem to have the complete GA run, but I could be wrong, still a fantastic upload and thanks for putting suge a huge file on here for the TPB"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-31T12:15Z,"This collection is truly awesome. It is, as people have pointed out, mislabeled because it doesn't include the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott) series.

However, it has everything from Hal Jordan's first appearance in Showcase in 1959 up to the end of 2010 (up to the Brightest Day maxi-series & tie-ins).

And I mean it has EVERYTHING, and in a very precise, logical reading order.

To Callvyn, I want to add that to collect any comics from the 1980's - forward, you'll want to have the appearances in other books and crossovers. Some people don't know or have forgotten that there wasn't a GL comic for a couple of years in the 80's, and so the stories from Action Comics Weekly, for example, are very important to this collection.

It is actually very well-organized once you see the files in order on your uTorrent window (or other client).

So a big thanks from me, xgrecu. I hope you seed it long enough for a few of us to complete the download, and I hope those who do get 100% help seed. I certainly will. Thanks again!"
,xgrecu,2013-05-31T15:21Z,any advice on how to speed up my upload will be welcome
,xgrecu,2013-05-31T15:22Z,"also, sorry for not putting more info on the description, but that was all I had "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-05-31T17:37Z,"all i know is, on my bigger torrents, it just takes time. thanks again."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-01T03:02Z,"alright, i got 100% ... soooo many power rings! LOL

will help seed"
,xgrecu,2013-06-01T18:57Z,"i'll keep seeding as long as it stays on my hard drive, but i'm gonna shut it down for the night :D"
