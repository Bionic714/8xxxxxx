So this collection I got from RlsLog after 10-12 days of waiting for the download to complete from a file hosting site, and since I didn't find it anywhere as a torrent, I decided to upload it myself. I will seed for about 10-15 ratio whenever I can, but after that it's your job to keep this alive, or feel free to reupload it. For any kind of information about this collection feel free to use Google, I heard it's a great search engine, or search for the title on RLSLOG.
