,paulo111,2013-06-01T11:18Z,where do i put the rar file?
,1EdgyGuy,2013-06-02T02:28Z,"@ paulo111 you do not put rar files anywhere (there are usually several rar files per movie)  , you just open the file and then right click on the top stack of books ,a window will open and left click on the one that says ""extract here"" it will do the work for you when it finishes it will be in a flie you understand then you can send that file wherever you put your movies.Or watch it ; hope that helps "")"

@paulo111
extract the rar file (using winrar or 7zip) then copy the extracted files to your phone,
then install the game (the .apk file)from your phone.
i hope this helped !

thnx for the upload .BONE."

,spawnholio666,2013-06-03T06:06Z,"107MB isn't that large. Some games are upwards of 1 GB. If you have a later model device, galaxy s3 for example, there's plenty of space for larger games.
