From Wiki:

Chilliwack is a Canadian rock band that had their heyday during the 1970s and 1980s. They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs "My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)", "I Believe", "Whatcha Gonna Do", "Fly At Night" and "Lonesome Mary". The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continues to tour across Canada. 



Greatest Hits 1988



Greatest Hits is a greatest hits album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack originally released in 1994. The albumΓÇÖs thirteen tracks, arranged in a backwards-chronological sequence, include the groupΓÇÖs most notable releases between the years 1969 and 1984 (and is, in fact, identical to the track listing of their album Segue). Allmusic rated Greatest Hits with four-and-a-half stars, calling the album "a truly solid package" and "a sincerely delightful collection."

In 2002, Greatest Hits was digitally remastered by Peter J. Moore using Sonic Solutions NoNoise Technology. The re-released compilation includes an eleven-page booklet recounting the groupΓÇÖs history. Also included on the remastered CD are the original full-length videos for "Whatcha Gonna Do" and "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)", which can be played on Windows Media Player.
