John Stuart Mill is the latest nom de guerre of former Brainiac guitarist John Schmersal, who embarked on a solo career after Tim Taylor's death in a 1997 car accident effectively ended that band. Known as one of the most creative members of Braniac, who focused on a noise-rock mixture of vintage synth sounds and alternately-tuned guitars, his solo projects took him in another direction. His debut solo album, Forget Everything, which was issued by Seethru Broadcasting in 1999, featured some of the genre-bending experimentation that marked his work with Braniac, but with a more melodic, acoustic sound.
