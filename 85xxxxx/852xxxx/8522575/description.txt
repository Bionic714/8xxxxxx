When the Haskin family seeks refuge from Y2K hysteria
in the isolated forests of the Sierra Diablos
mountains, madness and terror find them there. Abducted
by a vicious hillbilly clan, the Haskins fight for
survival, but neither they nor the hillbilly Crawfords
can comprehend the monstrous nightmare about to erupt
from the bowels of the earth

I'm not sure this is what the world had in mind back in
1999. This movie was made without the use of CGI so all of
the effects are done old school style with costumes and
miniatures. Definitely makes for a different experience
(bad and good). Please enjoy the movie from VH-PROD
