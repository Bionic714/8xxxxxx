,PurityDeath,2013-06-02T15:49Z,"TS should be Trade Screener rip.
A trade screener is a prescreen they send out in DVD format. It's the DVD quality vids that hit the internet before the movie is actually released in theaters. We saw a lot of good ones before the Oscars. (And often at other times. Just depends on who gets and uploads them)"
,Snaitf,2013-06-03T00:21Z,"@ PurityDeath:

A telesync (TS) is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often (although not always) filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth, the audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater). Sometimes the bootlegger will tape or conceal wireless microphones close to the speakers for better sound quality.

The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera's own frame rate and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronisation which can lead to additional temporal aliasing. A TS uses cam video with better-quality audio."
,jicaraca,2013-06-03T02:51Z,"Why would a TS be in the HD - Movies tab !? There are no idiotic arguments about it ... Just malice in this imbecile tag.
Trying to get some seeders to seed this piece of crap, using a dishonest tag ... its the same as a fake scamer ! Well deserved green skull indeed. "
,bobbymagee41,2013-06-07T19:44Z,"I just wrote quit raggin on people that give negative opinions about and upload, that's what this is for...but thcfreak666 that comment is so moronic it's amazing you know how to communicate"
,Speechless1998,2013-06-12T06:21Z,"Snaitf : A TS (telesync or trades screener) is not a camera mounted on a tripod (regardless of capture quality)...that's a ""CAM"".
They're most often sent out to critics (sometimes film festivals) - this is how you get chosen critics praise on promo posters before the actual release date."
,CptKlink,2013-06-14T09:34Z,"God so many people are stupid a TS is a TeleSync which is video from a CAM source Synced up to usaully a direct line connected to a headphone jack that some theaters have in there seats or connected directly to the line out of the sound system in the theater

What critics and such is called just a Screener and it called a screener cuz that is just what it is. It is used for critics and people who do the voting for award shows to screen the movie. it is the full movie is DVD quality to close to it but sometimes  some minor effects and such are missing usaully little things that wont effect on how the people rate the movie.
