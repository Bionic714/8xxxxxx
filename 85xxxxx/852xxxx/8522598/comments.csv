I don't know if it's just me, but some of airport gates are the default ones crammed on top of the scenery. Also there is only static traffic there. The AI traffic that was at the default airport doesn't show up. Idk, maybe it's because Imagine Studios isn't that great... some of their stuff does seem poorly designed.. from my point of view, that is.

Thanks anyway."
,ziggyjigg21,2013-05-31T02:07Z,No! This is the OLD version that's been out for at least five years!  Why would you upload this when they literally just released a new one not even a week ago?!
,DABspotting,2013-05-31T02:21Z,Is this the one that was just released?
,HardAcid,2013-05-31T04:27Z,"FS9 release. Why don't you check it first before you post, you fucking knob?"
