Happy Daze is a compilation album of songs linked to the Madchester music genre distributed by Island Records in 1990.
Influence

The Madchester sound had been developing during the later 1980s, from its nascent jangly sounds originally showcased on the NME's classic C86 cassette. By 1990, Madchester and related music was becoming more mainstream, but Happy Daze's release helped to crystallise awareness of the new overall Madchester sound by featuring tracks from several different yet converging forces. Although all have the 'Madchester spirit', by no means all the bands were from Manchester, The Shamen and The Soup Dragons being Scottish, The Charlatans from Northwich and the Pixies not being British at all (though they were very much 'adopted' by Brits of the time).

This has been seen as a criticism of the album, along with the glaring omission of songs by New Order or The Stone Roses and for not anticipating the imminent arrival of Grunge music. However the album's mythical aura continues to inspire nostalgia in fans of Madchester era music with some bloggers still remembering the 'happy daze of 1989/1990' in a semi-conscious reference to this album.
