Quinn Colson:
The Ranger (#1): After years of war, Army Ranger Quinn Colson returns home to the rugged, rough hill country of northeast Mississippi to find his native Tibbehah County overrun with corruption, decay, meth runners, and violence. His uncle, the longtime county sheriff, is dead. A suicide, heΓÇÖs told, but othersΓÇölike tomboy deputy Lillie VirgilΓÇöwhisper murder.

In the days that follow, itΓÇÖs up to Colson to discover the truth, not only about his uncle, but about his family, his friends, his town, and himself. And once itΓÇÖs discovered, thereΓÇÖs no going back for this real hero of the Deep South.

The Lost Ones (#2): When Army Ranger Quinn Colson, the new sheriff of Tebbehah County, is called out to investigate a child abuse case, what he finds is a horrifying scene of neglect, thirteen empty cribs, and a shoe box full of money. Janet and Ramon Torres seem to have skipped townΓÇöbut ColsonΓÇÖs sure theyΓÇÖll come back for the cash.

Meanwhile, ColsonΓÇÖs sister has returnedΓÇöclean and sober for good she says. His friend Boom has been drinking himself into oblivion and picking fights at the local bar. And his old flame is pregnant. But Colson canΓÇÖt focus on his personal problems. He and Deputy Lillie Virgil are convinced that Janet and Ramon have a taste for guns, drugs, and human trafficking. Soon Colson and Virgil find a link between the fugitive couple and a drug cartel that controls most of the Texas border, taking their investigation far beyond the rough hills of northeast MississippiΓÇª

The Broken Places (#3): A year after becoming sheriff, Quinn Colson is faced with the release of an infamous murderer from prison. Jamey Dixon comes back to Jericho preaching redemption, and some believe him; but for the victimΓÇÖs family, the only thought is revenge.

Another group who doesnΓÇÖt believe himΓÇöthe men in prison from DixonΓÇÖs last job, an armored car robbery. TheyΓÇÖre sure heΓÇÖs gone back to grab the hidden money, so they do the only thing they can: break out and head straight to Jericho themselves.

Colson and his deputy, Lillie, know theyΓÇÖve got their work cut out for them. But they donΓÇÖt count on one more unwelcome visitor: a tornado that causes havoc just as events come to a head. Communications are down, the roads are impassableΓÇöand the rule of law is just about to snap.
