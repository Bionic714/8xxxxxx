This is clearly from the original Bluray (as noted in the title) and not a conversion ...you can tell because during this movie many times 3D artifacts pop far out of the screen, which does not even come close to happening on conversions. HOWEVER the audio was Not DTS it was Dolby 5.1 on my Denon receiver. Still sounded wonderful though, but had to knock a couple of points off for that. Video was slightly grainy and colors were a little muted, but I am on a Sharp 80"" screen so any variances in quality really stand out. Would be unnoticeable on a 60""or smaller screen from normal viewing distances. Overall definitely well worth the download for a mediocre movie. Thanks for the file. "
