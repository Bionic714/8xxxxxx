The justly famed Carlton E. Morse had two minds when it came to great old time
radio shows........he did a wonderful family drama called "One Man's Family,"
but also was perhaps the finest adventure writer/director that radio had. His
great show "I Love A Mystery" was (and still is) one of the most beloved of
radio adventure shows. It was easy to see why.......the genius Morse touch was
evident in twisting plots, odd but very believable characters, and wonderfully
colorful dialogue that was funny, charming and inventive as well as exciting.

Warning: These old dramas may literally send shivers up and down your spine!!
