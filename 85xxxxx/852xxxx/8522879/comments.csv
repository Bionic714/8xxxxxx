The videos are 1280x720 mp4's. The audio is in 48 khz aac. 

Sorry about the textual noise (""ΓÇô"") in the description. Some characters got garbled when copied and pasted into the textbox. Dashes, quotes, and maybe something else. I didn't notice before hitting submit. 

I don't intend to seed this forever, because I won't be keeping the files forever. That means some of you will need to carry the baton for me.

You're welcome."
