,goldenaxxxe,2013-05-31T01:25Z,Thank you! Happy to see the updates are still coming in. I don't think I want to play this on Steam.
,SuperFulcrum,2013-05-31T10:35Z,Stify do you think there will be update 1.01 for Call of Juarez Gunslinger that fixes keyboard and mouse  stuttering
,XtraZoom,2013-05-31T22:31Z,v1.1.00 + DLC has been released. Looks like Helsing game developers is crazy enough to update the game roughly once a day.
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2013-06-01T16:43Z,Thnx!!!
,vladi77bg,2013-06-01T16:44Z,when can we expect the DRL ?
,thegreatwent,2013-06-01T19:39Z,we want 1.1 stiffy!
,Dunge,2013-06-02T22:51Z,"You do not need any previous update for this release, just the main release.""

Strange since the 1.0.03 update is 709.68 MiB and this one (1.0.07) is 432.93 MiB ... anyone can explain that?"
,Karlston,2013-06-03T12:19Z,"The smaller but later cumulative update seems weird.

Perhaps the larger .03 update .exe is unpacked, and the smaller .07 .exe is fully packed.

It's either explainable by different levels of compression, or it's a stuff-up. :)"
,Karlston,2013-06-04T22:23Z,"OK, it *is* compression. This one is the genuine cumulative 1.0.07 update release."
