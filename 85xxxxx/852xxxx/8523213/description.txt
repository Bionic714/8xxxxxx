My name is Geronimo Stilton and I live on Mouse Island, where I'm a newspaper writer and editor. I'm also an adventurer, though not a willing one -- my sister Thea and cousin Trap are always dragging me on outrageous escapades. Each of my books is a funny, fast-paced adventure with full color art that will appeal to kids ages seven to ten. And the stories? Well, they are whisker-licking-good tales, and that's a promise! 


Four Mice Deep In The Jungle
I have never been a brave mouse... but lately, my fears were taking over my life! Soon I was too afraid even to leave my mousehole. That's when Thea and Trap decided to cure me. They dragged me away on an airplane (I'm afraid of flying!) all the way to the jungle. There I was forced to eat bug soup, climb trees as high as skyscrapers, swim in raging rivers, and even wrangle snakes! How would a 'fraidy mouse like me ever survive?
