Description copied from Wikipedia:

Mr. AΓÇôZ is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Jason Mraz, released on July 26, 2005. It is the studio follow-up to his first studio album Waiting for My Rocket to Come, released in 2002. Even with mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success and debuted at #5 on Billboard's Top 200 albums chart. It was recognized for mixing many different genres of music together.

It was nominated by the Recording Academy, for Best engineered album, and producer Steve Lillywhite, who previously worked with U2, Dave Matthews Band and The Rolling Stones, won for Producer of the Year, but not for his work on Mr. AΓÇôZ. The name of the album is a play on the artist's surname, "Mraz".
