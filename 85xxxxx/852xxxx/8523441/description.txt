It's a summer bonanza of sizzling hot Simpsons stories! First, Bart and Milhouse battle it out to see who will become the Springfield Isotopes' new batboy. Next, Mr. Burns commandeers the Springfield public beach in the middle of a heatwave and stands between the citizens of Springfield and the surf. And when the Simpson family takes a summer vacation on the Silver Flash express train, they don't seem to be going anywhere in a flash and they are expressly miserable. Last but not least, when Bart and Milhouse are lost, Homer seeks the help of the only rule of law in the backwoods of Springfield, Judge Dredd-neck!
