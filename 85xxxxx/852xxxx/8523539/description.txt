History Documentary hosted by Robert Glenister, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Writers and historians give their own unique interpretations on the last days of Anne Boleyn, one of the most famous and controversial women in British history. In 1536 she became the first queen in Britain's history to be executed. The brutal speed of her downfall and the astonishing nature of the charges against her - treason, adultery, even incest - retain their power to shock. We know how Anne died but the story of why she had to go and who authored her violent end has been the subject of fiery debate across six centuries. In a radical new approach to televised history, a stellar cast of writers and historians, including Hilary Mantel, David Starkey and Philippa Gregory amongst others, battle out the story of her last days.
