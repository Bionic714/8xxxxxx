Larry uncovers how ingenuity, passion, sweat and sugar made Pennsylvania an industrial powerhouse. He starts by braving heights and heat as he joins a bunch of boilermakers as they do their gritty work on a Pittsburgh area power plant. He then sees the power of poop as he visits a bohemian entrepreneur who has turned the family feces into fabulous fertilizer. And then it gets weirder as he visits the bunker of the supreme survivalist of the Keystone State. Finally, he goes to the town built on everyone's favorite Pennsylvania product: Hershey!!
