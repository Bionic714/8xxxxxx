,TruSinner,2013-05-31T04:41Z,"@shadowspy

,PenVk,2013-05-31T05:01Z, Does anyone know if this is the real deal?
,Pro2Type,2013-05-31T05:08Z,"shadowspy, mkv files can be played on a PS3. It requires the program PS3 Media Server, a computer to stream the video from, and networking with cables instead of using wireless."
,sanitybleeds,2013-05-31T05:21Z,"@shadowspy - Don't listen to TruSinner, just download a Java-based PS3 media server app (Google it!) and you can stream MKV's and almost everything over your network to your PS3 except a few Cinavia protected files."
,sanitybleeds,2013-05-31T05:22Z,"@Pro2Type You can uses PS3 Media Server without cables, it works just fine over wireless networks too!"
,xidio,2013-05-31T05:29Z,"Its bozx, why would you need ""A/V"" ?
Its always high quality.


Whens the 1080p versions up?"
,sai.g.j,2013-05-31T05:58Z,Is this Real or Fake?
,Pro2Type,2013-05-31T06:11Z,"@sanitybleeds, streaming mkv is too much to handle for some wireless routers. In those cases they need to be networked with cables instead."
,totallyjcn,2013-05-31T07:12Z,Anyone know where to find mandarin subs for these new movies? Cant seem to find anything.

,flashos,2013-05-31T15:45Z,BOZX ruleZZZZZZZZ!!!!
,obvious2me,2013-06-01T07:55Z,"Why don't you guys have a cheap GPU w/ hdmi on your PC then hook it up to your TV. Dual/Duplicate monitor and view everything through VLC on your TV.

$30-40 if you want to do cheapest possible (Cable + Card).

OR $4 and you can run a DVI->HDMI cable from your current card.


I'm just not getting why you guys want to go through the hassle of viewing movies via your PS3."
,boobstrap,2013-06-01T09:11Z,"thanks BOZX, the true defender of the real HD-movie section!"
,totallyjcn,2013-06-01T09:15Z,Looking for Mandarin subs for this movie. Does anyone know where I might find some?
