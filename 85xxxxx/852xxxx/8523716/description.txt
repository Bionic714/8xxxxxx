RAR Files: No Password, no links, nothing stupid. Just decompress and good to go.

------------------------------

This is not a PDF file of the book, instead it is a full McGraw-Hill Education website rip of it.  It contains 2500+ files because it essentially has a link for each page, plus all the graphs/pictures/files that are in the book.

All of the CSS/JSS files are there and working, so it looks 95% exactly how it looks on the McGraw-Hill website. The Print Button and Text Size buttons work, but the search/forward/back do not.  They are not needed, because the book is fully navigable from all of the internal hyperlinks that you would normally use.

Just put the root folder anywhere you want and open the "Operations Management" shortcut, that is in the root.  This will open the index.html file, so that all the clutter can be avoided. 

Hope it all works for anyone that uses it.  I got tired of trying to find this book and had to finally get a copy, so I thought I would share and hopefully prevent frustration for other people.

Enjoy.
