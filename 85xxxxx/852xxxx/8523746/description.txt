At last, a weight-loss book for the enlightened! By debunking the traditional, the conventional and the downright unproven, Escape the Diet Trap steers would-be dieters away from short-term regimes towards long-term success. The Problem Rates of obesity continue to rise, despite a wealth of nutrition advice. While specific diets vary in approach, the advice is generally underpinned by the calorie principle: weight loss is simply a matter of eating less or exercising more. Yet both science and anecdote frequently reveal that this doesn't work beyond the short term. The Solution Escape the Diet Trap reveals why taking a calorie-based approach to weight loss essentially dooms us to failure. The dieter is not at fault, the approach is. Presenting ways of eating that offer enjoyable, satisfying fat loss, without extensive exercise, calorie-control or hunger, Escape the Diet Trap shows how to escape the cycle of restrictive attempts at weight loss and establish a healthy, sustainable relationship to food.
