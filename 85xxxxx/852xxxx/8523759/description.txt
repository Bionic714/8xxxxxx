The things which aren't available on the Internet unless I convert them. Sheesh.

Cherokee folk singer Don Grooms made his name as a songwriter and humorist on the Florida folk circuit. I had the privilege of meeting him, hearing him play, buying his tape, and pirating his legacy. I wish I had more to share. 

"Cuz this is my song and I'll sing it like I want to
If you like my music sing along with me.
But don't try to change a part
Of the songbird in my heart
And don't try and tell me that the song is wrong
You can always change the singer
You can't change my song.

You can always get another singer
But you'll just get another song."

    -Don Grooms, 1930-1998
