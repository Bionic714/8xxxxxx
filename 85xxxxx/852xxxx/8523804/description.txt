I've always admired Dave and consider him somewhat of a genius when it comes to business. He took a new idea (the 100% commission concept) and created a company that can now boast of locations all over the world. No one can question his tenacity when it comes to his business model, his race car driving or his attempt to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon. He is also known to be a bit stubborn at times.
