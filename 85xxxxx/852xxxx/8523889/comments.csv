V: 9
A: 8"
,botoxbutox,2013-05-31T23:15Z,"@bitchyfish: Boo-hoo, Don't like the format? Don't D/L. U/L it in your own personal favorite format then. Don't make ignorant, negative comments. Mkv is now, man, you're part of the past."

I wish I could block seeing IDIOTIC posts like these in the comments. 

What kind of rock have you been living under the past ten years?..

Best format ever?

What's the problem? Just get K-Lite codecs for Windows media player... 

Done."
,moovees,2013-06-02T18:36Z,"I don't think ouchyfish has been living under a rock, and neither have I.  I'm fully aware of what mkv files are, and I love this site and am eternally grateful for having the privilege to use it thanks to the many kind uploaders.  However, I too hate mkv's and it bugs me that nobody is uploading any of these episodes in mp4 which is just as good in my opinion.  The problem with mkvs is that nothing plays THEM!!!! If you sit with a computer in your lap watching movies that's one thing and that doesn't sound like much fun to me, but no other device plays them... xbox, ps3, media database hardware... so WHY?  "
,p5d,2013-06-02T23:12Z,I mean yeah its annoying that .mkv's do not play on ps3 or xbox. Don't complain thank the uploader and move on. Obviously eztv has been getting more request to upload in mkv than mp4. I'm in the same boat as you guys but I love all of eztv's work and appreciate all the shows and movies I have gotten from him. Thanks man.

Thanks!."
