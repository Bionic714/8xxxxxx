,zodii,2013-06-01T22:09Z,"no Shut the FUCK up with ur retarded ratings of A/V I don't give a flying FUCK about what you deem to be a good quality, if you won't rate the Movie (M). That's the most important shit, rate the MOVIE or dont rate any flying fucking thing"
,Beetlejuicexx,2013-06-01T23:03Z,"Zodii - people will only tend to rate the audio and visual quality so others know whether this torrent is good enough for watching on outputs that can support higher quality plus the usual tablets, Desktop, PC's and laptops.

The main reason people don't write the movie rating is because movies are all about personal opinion. I could potentially rate this movie as 4 out of 10, because it wasn't something i particularly enjoyed, but others could rate it a 9 because they loved it. Download it for yourself, as you know it's a decent rip and decide for yourself about whether or not YOU enjoy the movie, not whether or not someone else enjoyed the movie."

,downrage,2013-06-02T18:55Z,"zodii, you are an absolute MORON! The video and audio quality are by far the most important! Whether a movie is a good watch or not is in the eyes of the beholder. Go to IMDB if you wanna see what people think is good. Alot of torrents like this one have a link right in the description! It suprises me how people like you make it through life, it really does."

This needs to be put in the right section as well. 705.79MB is no where near Blu-Ray

,rsgibson,2013-06-03T21:57Z,I agree with the objections of many - 640 x 272 @ 722 Kbps is not Bluray quality. Just because your source was Bluray that information is made irrelevant if you chose a SD resolution and a low bitrate. I've had DVD rips that are higher quality than many of these so called BD rips.

,dlarrym1111,2013-06-06T07:11Z,"@FDSeoul:
If some one is ""leeching"", that is someone who is downloading and seeding at the same time. A seeder has finished downloading and is just seeding, not seeding the same file one is downloading. SO, ASSHOLE, If you are downloading and are seeding you are telling yourself to fuck off. To NOT BE A LEECHER, or TO BE a ""SEEDER"", you must have the file 100% downloaded, and then be in the act of uploading it at that time. If you haven't finished downloading but have started seeding, as I pointed out, you are a LEECHER by definition.  Wikipedia explains this in detail to any and all who think I am wrong. The term ""leeching"" is misleading. "
,dlarrym1111,2013-06-06T07:16Z,"You can download and turn your uploading amount to ZERO kb per sec, that makes you a ""leecher"" too I think there should be a separate term for that called ""Douching"". 
It actually doesn't negatively affect your download speed by uploading at the same time.
The term leeching was coined early in bit torrent software development several many years back and really is too negative sounding for what it actually means.
I think it is very infrequent for people to not upload at least a little while downloading. That shouldn't be called a negative term but yet it is."

,anonymous4422,2013-06-09T00:43Z,"""Bad Quality for a Blue Ray""

You're a bunch of idiots.

Its a Blue Ray 'RIP'

Which means it was ripped from a blue ray, which basically is trying to tell you it didnt come from a camera at a theatre.

Learn what a RIP is. DVD RIP's are the same fucking thing, they're ripped from a DVD Files (Which is 4.8gb), and compressed to about 700mb.

If its 700 fucking megabytes, do you really think its BLUE RAY quality."
,justmealwatts,2013-06-10T19:08Z,Thanks!!! Enjoyed the movie and I do not have any complaints.  aw
,mrcory666,2013-06-14T03:33Z,"@dlarrym1111
Right on all counts except one. If you change your seeding rate to zero it actually seeds at max. You can seed at one and it will do it slowly. But it does affect you download speeds. Reason you have to upload is because if you don't the ip's that are seeding won't know where to send the packets. Just thought I would let you know that so you don't sound moronic in the future. And thank you very much for the upload it is a very good fantasy flick."
