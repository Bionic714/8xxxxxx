===================== NOTE =====================
.
.
If any of MY torrents get NO or only a few Comments

Then I take this as:

You never liked the series
You never liked the quality
You are ALL very ill-mannered

It does no matter which one of the above, but


I will not re-seed any torrent that has no comments

I never re-seed for downloaders I do not know
If you've never posted a comment on my torrents I do not know you
Do not ask for a re-seed you will be ignored
.
Once 5 people complete I stop seeding
.
I do NOT expect comments on how great I am, I already know that
Comments on quality help YOU the downloaders

=================================================

Filmed in front of a live studio audience, this is Watson & Oliver - the BBC's latest sketch show, mixing a variety of different characters and styles.

 Best friends since school, Lorna Watson and Ingrid Oliver are well known on the live comedy circuit. They have had three consecutive sell-out Edinburgh Festival shows and appeared in a wealth of comedy greats such as the BAFTA-winning Peep Show, The IT Crowd and We Are Klang.

 Characters include the Georgian ladies, Jean and Lou in their prison sketch, and Wills and Kate reminiscing about their wedding day.
