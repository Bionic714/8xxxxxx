From the strength of Ben Marwoods debut album, I have been eagerly anticipating his follow up and wondering what he will do next. Ben is one of those unique writers who can quip a phrase that captures what takes other artists five albums to achieve. ΓÇÿBack downΓÇÖ is a beautifully written album full of honesty, it is rare now that writers pour themselves into songs as fully as Ben does. Lines such as ΓÇÿmaybe IΓÇÖm only here on the strength of my peersΓÇÖ shows Ben isnΓÇÖt afraid to recognise his own fears.

Back down has a maturity that isnΓÇÖt found in its predecessor, the song writing being more personal and profound. The tone of the album is fairly dark with songs about death, growing old and the unsettling murder ballad ΓÇÿunder lock and keyΓÇÖ. ΓÇÿThis industry eats its youngΓÇÖ has some lines that had me actually laughing aloud, However dark this album gets songs such as ΓÇÿthis industry eats its young ΓÇÿshows BenΓÇÖs humour and wit hasnΓÇÖt left him, ΓÇÿIΓÇÖm satisfied, provided that my record sales outnumber my number of chinsΓÇÖ is without a doubt one of my favourite lines of the album.

It was great to hear that this album had a good blend of BenΓÇÖs staple acoustic sound along with full band collaborations too. ΓÇÿI promise you that it will be okayΓÇÖ is a really stand out track, it starts with some brisk bursts of aggressive electric guitar, followed by some really lovely banjo rolls, who doesnΓÇÖt love the banjo?

If I had any criticisms on this album it would be that I found it too short, it is 14 tracks long and it ends perfectly with the mournful acapella track Lake Wales, however I still found myself wanting more.
