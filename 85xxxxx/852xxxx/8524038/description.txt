IMDb Info

Sent to the market by his uncle to sell their horse and buy thatch for their roof, Jack
meets the beautiful Princess Isabelle whom he rescues her from ruffians. He returns
home only with a handful of beads given to him by a monk who claimed they were sacred
but that does little to impress his uncle who tosses them away. In the night the Princess arrives
having run off to keep from marrying Roderick who is clearly only interested in becoming king.
Soon the beans take root with a giant stalk carrying away the princess and Jack's house.
He soon sets off on an adventure with the king's guards to rescue the princess only to find
that a mythical land filled with giants really exists.
