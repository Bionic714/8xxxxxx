,shauwy1978,2013-06-01T01:04Z,Why upload this if you can't play multiplayer and you can't play with bots to try it buy the game but Don't download this !!!
,moedown,2013-06-01T03:21Z,"  Shauwy, this game supports LAN play, so u can play locally, or use a program like tunngle to use a LAN connection to play online..."

,urquy,2013-06-01T23:17Z,How do I set up a LAN game...I used to know this stuff.  I guess ive lost my touch
,urquy,2013-06-02T00:47Z,Ok so I figure how to setup a server on tunggle. How do I get it to show up in the game?
,nignug,2013-06-03T01:54Z,"Guys you can't play this on Steam, but that is just obvious. Download the program Tunngle to LAN with other people(I haven't checked if any servers are up yet). That, or you and some friends can download the game and play LAN locally."
,nignug,2013-06-03T01:55Z,urquuy LAN connects by IP. You need to be connected to the person's IP to play on their server.
,kyoh119,2013-06-03T14:20Z,"So I put all the files from the torrent into the game files, and I keep getting an error that says ""steam_api.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error."" Anyone know how I can fix this? Thanks for the upload."
