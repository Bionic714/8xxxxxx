,pirutluva,2013-06-03T07:24Z,@Kona_Guy!!!! Dude Hello YIFY Torrents May Not Be The Highest Definition But They Are Good For People Who Want To Watch The Movie Now Not Next Week. It Takes About 2O Mins To Download A 2.5G YIFY Torrent Vs Anywhere From 12 Hour Up To 2 Days For Some Of The Bigger Files. Did You Ever Once Use Whats In  Your Brain Case Before Shooting Off Your Big Ass Pie Hole And Think Hey Some People Have Limited Hardware Or Maybe A Slow Or Metered Connection? And Its Because Of That YIFY Is A Very Good Uploader And You Who Have Not Contributed Anything But Your Absurd Silly Nothing But Noob Comments! With that Being  Said Lets Move On....I would Like To Thank You BOZX For Sharing This Upload....A10...A/10.  A Most Excellent Upload..CHEERS :)>
