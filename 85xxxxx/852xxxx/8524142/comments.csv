,frenchnyc,2013-06-01T04:18Z,"Just Perfect. As usual. I am wondering if I should only download YIFI, because they are always the best. Cheers.
A=10
V=9"
,chewslab,2013-06-01T06:22Z,"too bad the audio is only in stereo and not 5.1 surround. I'm sure 99% of us would be fine with another 100mb on the file size for much better audio. 
v8
a5 (stereo audio is a 5 at best)"
,JohnnyGhost,2013-06-01T07:12Z,Why's this Yify dude never share the Audio info?... it's fuhkin' bullshit if it's not at least 5.1... I'm gettin' Bozx.... and if you lie later... I'll know. heh heh heh
,obvious2me,2013-06-01T07:38Z,Audio in uploads from YIFY are always in Stereo. Get some decent tower speakers (using the money you save on movies perhaps?).
,Dommy99,2013-06-01T08:44Z,"Thanks YIFY! His rips are not 5.1 for the same reason he isnt going to want to add 100 mb to make it that way is because he is known for his small size rips. Im pretty sure they are intended for computer screens or mobile devices, so if you are looking for a larger filesize/ higher quality for bigger screens, look elsewhere. PLEASE dont talk shit to someone who takes the time to rip hundreds of movies a week and offer them up to everyone, including people who are clearly undeserving. I have tons of YIFY rips, and then when i want to watch a movie on the bigscreen or if its a absolute favorite of mine, ill grab a 2-6 gb rip. But im not going to talk crap because YIFY didnt make it exactly the way I want."

,andreTPF,2013-06-02T04:36Z,What About 3D HSBS??
,brazcafe2,2013-06-02T16:07Z,"Thanks YIFY for hard work with uploads in general.

Will not download this as saw it in the movie theater. M: 4. V: 5 (The 3D sucked and in general I found the movie looking stupid :)) Movie contains surprising gore scenes. Considering I thought it is pure whole family fantasy, getting heads chopped off etc was a bit of a curiosity. :)"
,wmillsw,2013-06-02T17:25Z,"The pirate bay HD-movies section is completly ruined because YIFY shitty rips. Now if you want to see a HD-movie you have to come and shift trough the shit. YIFY rips are in the same section of REAL HD-movies how can this be? Please someone moderate this. Stop uploading this crap here, put it on movies, not fucking here"
,cri23cri,2013-06-02T20:02Z,wmsillsw - quit your bitching and complaining. wtf are you watching on a 70-8inch tv? if you can shell out the cash for that then go buy you fucking movies. how is it you have to go through yifys torrents to find what you want? learn how to search for wtf you want.  go sit in a corner 
,cri23cri,2013-06-02T20:06Z,yifys movies look perfect on my samsung 60inch smart tv. nobody wants to wait 12 hours+ for a 9gb movie to download. if you want to build your movie collection go buy the shit.
,PauloFran,2013-06-03T01:09Z,"Excellent video quality.
Great movie.
Thank you!"

,mesmis,2013-06-03T19:37Z, Thank you! 
,shawnmurthy,2013-06-04T01:30Z,his movies are good for the size. its just audio needs to be better thats the only thing. if his audio bitrate is better then he would be the best. 
,geno2k3,2013-06-04T08:22Z,"YIFY can you upload things in 720 AND 1080?

Thanks."
