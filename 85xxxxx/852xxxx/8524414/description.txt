Dave Stapleton keeps quietly adding strings to his bow, such as his exciting
quintet of fresh faces, his prolific composing, and the creation of a record
label (Edition) that has enlisted one of Europe's great young sax discoveries
in Marius Neset. Flight is an impressionistic venture for jazz group and
strings on which the formidable Neset guests. Stapleton's string-quartet
writing doesn't exactly push melodic envelopes here, but it links narratives to
a subtle balance of forceful postbop and Jan Garbarek-like folk-jazz. Neset's
tenor sax arrives quietly in a slowly cycling strings theme at first, but soon
erupts over Dave Kane's assertive bass-playing and exciting Finnish newcomer
Olavi Louhivuori's drums. It could have been trimmed a shade, but it's another
leap forward for a fast-developing European jazz original.
