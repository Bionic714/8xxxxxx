AngryBirdsInstaller 3.0.0

AngryBirdsRioInstaller 1.4.4

AngryBirdsSeasons 3.2.0

AngryBirdsSpaceInstaller 1.4.1

AngryBirdsStarWarsInstaller 1.1.2


All you have to do is:

Launch the executable sfx archive, let it extract then assist it to install,
When the game opens first time click "Activate" from the first screen
and enter anything (at least 1 digit...)

angry birds classic and rio do not need internet connection..they will activate through loopback, simulating server connection

However..seasons, space and starwars need to communicate with the Rovio server to quickly send back to you the activation signal.

I did this because I saw many patches containing weird stuff (...) on them and some of them didn't work also... here you have the nice, easy, clean  thing.

enjoy!
