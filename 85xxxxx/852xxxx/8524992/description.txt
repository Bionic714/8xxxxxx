Few artists make such an impression as Sofia Jannok. Her passion and charisma leave no one indifferent. Her new musical expression gives us an emotional and grand experience at the intersection between the complexity of modern indie pop and timeless nerve. With tours ranging from Kautokeino in northern Norway to Shanghai in China, she engages the audience with her uncompromising style rooted in the strength of the northern plains. When the heart sings, people listen.
