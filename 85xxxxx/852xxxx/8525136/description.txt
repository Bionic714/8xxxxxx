The discography of My Bloody Valentine, an alternative rock band formed in Dublin, Ireland in 1983, consists of three studio albums, two mini albums, one live album, seven extended plays (EPs), twelve singles, six music videos and two compilation albums. The band pioneered and popularized a subgenre of alternative music known as "shoegazing", which critic Simon Reynolds called "a departure from the traditional rock musculature of riff and powerchord, towards a new and private lexicon of sounds and effects."
My Bloody Valentine released its debut mini album, This Is Your Bloody Valentine, in 1985 on Tycoon Records with its original line-up: Dave Conway on vocals, Kevin Shields on guitar and bass, Colm Ó Cíosóig on drums and Tina Durkin on keyboards. After the album failed to receive much attention, the band relocated to London. The band recruited bassist Debbie Googe after the album's release and this line-up released three further EPs: Geek! in 1985, The New Record by My Bloody Valentine in 1986 and Sunny Sundae Smile in 1987 on various independent labels. Following Conway's departure, vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher joined in 1987 and the band released one further EP, Strawberry Wine, and one mini album, Ecstasy, on Lazy Records before signing to Creation Records in 1988.[4] During its time on Creation, My Bloody Valentine produced its most notable material, including their two full-length studio albums, Isn't Anything (1988) and Loveless (1991). Both albums, and their singles, were successful. Isn't Anything reached number 1 on the UK Indie Chart, Glider reached number 2, and Tremolo reached 1 on the UK Indie Chart. Loveless debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 24, and its lead single "Only Shallow" charted at number 27 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks. Loveless has since sold over 250,000 copies in the United States alone.
