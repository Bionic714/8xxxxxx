Joe Henderson - 1973 - Canyon Lady (1997)

This album has trumpeter Luis Gasca featured as a co-star with tenor-saxophonist Joe Henderson. Gasca arranged "Tres Palabras" which is played by a 13-piece group (Oscar Brashear takes the trumpet solo) while the other three originals (two by pianist Mark Levine) use either a sextet or a nonet. Henderson is in fine form on these spirited Latinish performances which have also been included on his eight-CD Milestone box set. (AllMusic)
