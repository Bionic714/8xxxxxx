But before I download, could anyone tell us about the A/V quality?
The screenshots look good. But I need a first hand review on the A/V, please!!"
,anwita,2013-06-01T06:48Z,how is the print??/
,precariousvarun,2013-06-01T15:17Z,"I downloaded it.

V - 6.5
A - 9

A couple of noteworthy points :

The audio is quite clear. There's no aberration of any sort, at all. I wanna keep it short but the audio is unusually clear for a Scam-Rip so soon after the release of the movie.

Umm, the video quality is not quite up to the mark but it is WATCHABLE (on a lap, not on a screen). Fast moving frames blurr at points (especially the dance snippets). Overall - OK!

The movie is good.  "
