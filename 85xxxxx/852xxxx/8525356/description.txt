Note:
This episode of HARDtalk was apparently not broadcasted on TV, but was available on BBC-iPlayer. This video is a screen capture of this made on a somewhat geriatric laptop. The quality of the video is a bit jittery at times, especially in the first two or three minutes. My excuses for that.

Friday 05-24-2013: Stuart Wheeler - Treasurer, UK Independent Party

When voters feel angry they look for ways to punish their political masters - that's one powerful factor behind the rise of the UK Independence Party, UKIP, a populist anti-EU, anti-immigration movement fuelled by frustration with the status quo. Stephen Sackur speaks to UKIP's treasurer, Stuart Wheeler. Like many UKIP followers he used to support the Conservatives. So, how can he justify the damage he's now doing to David Cameron's party?
