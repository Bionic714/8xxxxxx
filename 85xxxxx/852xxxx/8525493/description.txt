Part 6 of my fan edit rearranging all of River Song's appearances in the order she experienced them.  Parts 1-5 can be found here:

This one is basically just a reformatting of the episode The Name of the Doctor into the style of the first five parts: Removing scenes before River appears and after she leaves, moving the pre-titles flashforward into chronological order, and adding subtitles to identify where characters are in their own lifetimes relative to The Battle of Demon's Run.

Updated edit notes and timelines for all six parts included in torrent.
