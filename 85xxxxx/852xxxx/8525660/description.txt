This is the class 91 i was doing but never finished, it includes an updated version of the Class 91 Cab.

You can download the original 225 freeware set from the switching yard, and use this 91 model for the updated cab and sounds.

Feel free to change anything as i know there were some errors still.

Again due to RWD deciding to take some things from the user Railworksdepot, i have decided to upload this to TPB.
