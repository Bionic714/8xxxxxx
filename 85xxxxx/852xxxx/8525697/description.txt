Big Lonesome was intended to be a duets album. But when Chapman's musical soulmate, acclaimed singer-songwriter Tim Krekel, suddenly succumbed to cancer in 2009, her plans were dashed. The period of mourning that followed has produced a remarkable collection of songs, a concept album about grief in the vein of Rosanne CashΓÇÖs Black Cadillac.

Like Cash, Chapman wisely keeps her sorrow grounded in specific images instead of broad themes. ΓÇ£WhatΓÇÖs that sound/ like something falling through the trees,ΓÇ¥ she laments in the albumΓÇÖs centerpiece, ΓÇ£Falling Through the Trees,ΓÇ¥ a song so rich in metaphor that it demands multiple listenings.

ItΓÇÖs a bit of a departure for the raucous ChapmanΓÇöwho was once advised by Jerry Lee Lewis to not burn outΓÇöallowing her trademark piss-ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ-vinegar sound to be tempered by a quiet melancholy. The result is a country album in the classic sense, full of heartache and longing. Big Lonesome might just be ChapmanΓÇÖs masterpiece.
