Maybe your TV is as good at reproducing colors as your computer monitor is, leading to the discrepancy in perceived quality between the 55"" TV and your monitor. I watch most things on an Ultrasharp or a 46"" TV, and I have no problems with the quality of the copy, but the colors and blacks never look as good on the TV, even if it has LED backlighting and some other new tech. Judas releases are very crisp, especially for the file size."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-06T18:36Z,"The only reason any of my encodes suffer in any aspect is usually due to dithering issues that are usually present on the bluray ... and of course the ultra high compression which can't always give you perfect results... something has to be lost...

Now I could improve things by moving to 10 bit encoding over the common 8bit, this usually can really significantly improve in some scenarios where the bluray is pristine and not riddled with dithering issues or color banding. I usually reference Final Fantasy Spirits Within as it is the first movie I encoded in which I REALLY noticed horrible blacks and how it looks rather horrible. I thought it was my encoding method... suffice it to say, it wasn't what I was doing, I was replicating it rather well, the bluray that I have .... they just did a bad job putting it on the disk....

Blacks being such a simple and not very complex thing, I would have thought they would have little issue making blurays with rich blacks.. but apparently not."
