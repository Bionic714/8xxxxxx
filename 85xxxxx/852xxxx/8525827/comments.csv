After watching all four, the quality is good to excellent but the content is so biased that it''s impossible to discern fact from fiction. According to this series, the Palestinians were peace-lobing innocents who were totally suppressed by zionism. For example, they mention that certain Jewish Palestinians fought for the british army but failed to mention that there were regiments of Muslim/Arab Palestinians who fought for the Nazis.  

There are enough recriminations to go around but this kind of agitprop is useless in gaining a clear picture of both the history and potential for resolution in the area. "
