,sidtyagi,2013-05-31T19:25Z,"my laptop specifications -
radeon 6770M
i7
4gb ram....
game lags too much....works fine only in 800*600 with lowest setting......please suggest me how can i play this game without lags.."
,freerail,2013-05-31T19:58Z,"If your running the 2012 version that has alot of lags, even on my Gaming rig it has lags. but the new 2013 version has been optimised fairly well and can run it on full settings with no problem. Yet i try that with the 2012 version it runs really slow."
