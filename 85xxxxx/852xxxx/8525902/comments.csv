,lawrj11,2013-06-01T00:01Z,@larsper this sceney already has Santos Dumont.
,KevTheOne,2013-06-01T00:33Z,"Does it work? Can someone confirm?
Hope it does, this scenery is one of the best I ever seen."
,Asasvespa,2013-06-01T03:27Z,"@ KevTheOne 
Yes its work great, the city is awesome, very detailed with all autogen buildings and not consumed farm-rats. 
 however the surroundings villages are without  autogen, only google photo real carpet"
,mcbiel,2013-06-01T03:51Z,Seed please!
,udidwht,2013-06-01T04:59Z,Please seed everyone.
,mcbiel,2013-06-01T05:24Z,"What is the sequence of the folders?

I don't see much autogens around the city at all,."
,mcbiel,2013-06-01T05:52Z,"OK..I checked against eh you tube video.  I think all the buildings and cities land marks in the original scenery does appear here.

Its true there are some empty photoscenery stretches around Rio with no autogens..But thats how it is in the original product... so this is a good and complete scenery"
,udidwht,2013-06-01T15:25Z,"How do you install this? I also currently use FS Global 2010 SP1 mesh as well. This includes a mesh do I need it or can this be installed using FS Global mesh?

Much appreciated"
,ITALY44,2013-06-01T16:53Z,"thanks my friend, but I need to fs9"
,mcbiel,2013-06-01T19:56Z,I have two bridges.. (The long bridge... How do I get rid of the default ugly bridge?
,rieper45,2013-06-02T22:48Z,THANK You!
,udidwht,2013-06-03T05:12Z,"@mcbiel

Look in your FSX settings under the 'Scenery add on' order. This scenery should be above any default FSX scenery but below any 3rd party airport add ons."
,Rusak96,2013-06-03T19:14Z,"Thanks, enoixz. 

Req: ORBX Elstree EGTR"
,rf253,2013-06-04T03:39Z,"THX enoixz great download

One question though. What order in the Scenery Library do these 6 folders need to be in as could not find any readme file or documentation at all ?"
,udidwht,2013-06-05T06:02Z,"@enoixz

Also explain the install process. Does the mesh need installing if one is using mesh such as FS Global 2010 SP1? If not, what's the install procedure?"
,enoixz,2013-06-05T18:58Z,"Check in another torrent how to install a rip scenery, sorry I can't help."
,piratebrazilian,2013-06-07T06:30Z,Thank you. request: Mega São Paulo
,DarkstarG,2013-06-07T07:53Z,"Thanks for the upload, however it is missing some parts. The installer removes double objects too. Also I don't know if this is the installer problem or simply if that is the way the scenery is, away from Rio, on the side, there are only textures without autogen, and that looks really as bad as it can in FSX."
,lawrj11,2013-06-07T19:49Z,"I agree with DarkstarG, there are some parts missing in this package, that's why you have double objects."
,CHAA1123,2013-06-08T09:27Z,I also have two bridges (Rio-Niteroi). How to hide one of them?
