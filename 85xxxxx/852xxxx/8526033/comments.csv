,Arcmano,2013-06-01T00:39Z,Is missing in the file FSX AIRAC 1306 (FlightSim Commander FSC). You could include it. Thanks again.
,Brill51,2013-06-01T04:32Z,Part II with the missing installers will upload today -on the origin of this abload -
,namco-nexgen,2013-06-01T11:28Z,"I found this somewhere else, i just shared it here. If i get to find the rest, i can do the same."
,David-7237,2013-06-01T16:04Z,"if it was not compressed, to allow us pick what we need, it would have been more great,

thankx btw"
,clintferns,2013-06-01T17:19Z,"Hey,..Req the latest woai traffic package...Thanks"
,Brill51,2013-06-01T23:35Z,"Credits go to beorse.bz -there you find the reupload with FSC etc. And yes most off Flight Addons you get there first -its the frontline

And give a big Thanks to the uploader on tpb (btw. i love tpb), now you can buy the TBM850 or ORBX EGTR yourself or until anyone will upload them..."

No it doesn't. That site has little to no FSX stuff on it. "
,doc179,2013-06-02T15:27Z,thanks
,ovracvr,2013-06-02T17:29Z,no good for me if the whole thing is one zipped file
,xnolunchx,2013-06-03T03:14Z,"be careful when installing. There's a box that says something along the lines of ""backing up the nav data"". It broke a few planes for me and Flightsim Commander. "
