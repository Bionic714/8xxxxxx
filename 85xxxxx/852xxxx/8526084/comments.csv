,phreadom,2013-06-01T08:36Z,"These are in fact wallpapers of Japan, and nice ones from the look of it, so thanks for that... but posting things like this as a single compressed file has always struck me as one of the dumbest things one can possibly do when creating a torrent, short of not seeding it.

Why is it so hard for people to grasp the concept of ""people will be more likely to seed this when they're done downloading it if they don't have to keep two copies of the files around and waste their drive space""? hrm?

Not to mention being able to easily preview some files to see if it's worth downloading half a gig etc."
,phreadom,2013-06-01T08:42Z,"It is especially relevant when it comes to files like images, because they are generally already compressed about as much as possible. So putting them in a zip or rar file doesn't even save any appreciable space. It's gains nothing, but does create several inconveniences for the user and makes it less likely that anyone will seed, and thus more likely that the torrent will die sooner."
