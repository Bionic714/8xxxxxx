All of Beth Orton's albums except the super rare Superpinkymandy, in 320kbps AAC, all ripped directly from my CDs

Contains:
Trailer Park (1996)
Central Reservation (1999)
Daybreaker (2002)
Comfort Of Strangers (2006)
Sugaring Season (2012)

These are in AAC because I use itunes, but if anyone would like I could rerip to mp3 or another format for use in other programs
