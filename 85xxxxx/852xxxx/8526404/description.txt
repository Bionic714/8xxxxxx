Rule (Marked Men #1) by Jay Crownover (December 30th 2012)

Opposites in every way . . . except the one that matters 

Shaw Landon loved Rule Archer from the moment she laid eyes on him. Rule is everything a straight--A pre-med student like Shaw shouldnΓÇÖt want--and the only person sheΓÇÖs never tried to please. She isnΓÇÖt afraid of his scary piercings and tattoos or his wild attitude. Though she knows that Rule is wrong for her, her heart just wonΓÇÖt listen.

To a rebel like Rule Archer, Shaw Landon is a stuck-up, perfect princess-and his dead twin brotherΓÇÖs girl. She lives by other peopleΓÇÖs rules; he makes his own. He doesnΓÇÖt have time for a good girl like Shaw-even if sheΓÇÖs the only one who can see the person he truly is.

But a short skirt, too many birthday cocktails, and spilled secrets lead to a night neither can forget. Now, Shaw and Rule have to figure out how a girl like her and a guy like him are supposed to be together without destroying their love . . . or each other. 

Jet (Marked Men #2) by Jay Crownover (May 28th 2013) 

With his tight leather pants and a sharp edge that makes him dangerous, Jet Keller is every girlΓÇÖs rock and roll fantasy. But Ayden Cross is done walking on the wild side with bad boys. She doesnΓÇÖt want to give in to the heat she sees in JetΓÇÖs dark, haunted eyes. SheΓÇÖs afraid of getting burned from the sparks of their spontaneous combustion, even as his touch sets her on fire.

Jet canΓÇÖt resist the Southern Belle with mile-long legs in cowboy boots who defies his every expectation. Yet the closer he feels to Ayden, the less he seems to know her. While heΓÇÖs tempted to get under her skin and undo her in every way, he knows firsthand what happens to two people with very different ideas about relationships.

Will the blaze burn into an enduring love. . . or will it consume their dreams and turn them to ashes? 


Seed and Enjoy!
