This is the match that was shot LIVE May17th for the Interim Welter Weight Belt. Mistress Kara made it to the finals but with a rib injury, she has to sit -out on the first championship EVER. Penny and Izamar have been calling Kara out since she announce she would not be able to do the final. There was a twitter war of word between all 3 opponents. Penny and Izamar have been calling Kara "chicken" and Kara just refers them both to her flawless, undefeated record and thinks she doesn't have anything to prove since she has whooped on both Penny and Izamar this season. In fact both Penny and Izamar have their only loss this season to Kara. Penny and Izamar have identical records for the season of 3 wins and 1 loss. Penny was extremely eager to get the chance at a rematch with Mistress Kara. If Penny wins today, she gets that chance. If Izamar wins she get the belt.
