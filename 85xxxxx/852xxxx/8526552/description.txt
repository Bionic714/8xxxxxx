Beauty From Pain (Beauty #1) by Georgia Cates (January 29th 2013)

They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries.

Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of AustraliaΓÇÖs most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and thatΓÇÖs why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and theyΓÇÖre always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.

ItΓÇÖs his game and his rules. HeΓÇÖs content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, sheΓÇÖs exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer.

How do you move on when heΓÇÖs every song you sing?

After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left. Determined to find a distraction from the pain of losing Jack Henry, she immerses herself in her music. But with her old life comes old acquaintances and new expectations. When Laurelyn refuses her record producerΓÇÖs outrageous demands, she finds herself without a careerΓÇöuntil an unforeseen opportunity presents itself. From there itΓÇÖs a rocket ride straight to the top where Laurelyn finds the success sheΓÇÖs always dreamed of. Will it be enough to bring her the happiness she so deserves, or will the absence of Jack Henry leave her wanting more?

Jack Henry McLachlan never expected to fall in love with Laurelyn PrescottΓÇöbut he did. After he foolishly let her slip through his fingers, he spends three months searching for her, but their reunion doesnΓÇÖt come easy. The woman he finds isnΓÇÖt the same one who drifted away without a goodbye. No longer an insecure girl on an Australian adventure, this Laurelyn is a successful musician with a promising career. Her dreams are becoming a reality, and Jack is terrified his American girl wonΓÇÖt have a place for him in her new life. With only a month to convince her otherwise, will it be enough time to make her visualize a life beyond the glitz and glamour, a life that includes him?
