Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, May 31 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex takes a close look at the build up to a Syrian civil war, where western funded Al-Qaeda-affiliated Syrian opposition groups are becoming increasingly extremist and dominated by foreign jihadists, as Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad vows retaliation against future air strikes emboldened by fresh Russian arms shipment. 

Alex also breaks down what he expects during his upcoming trip to Watford, UK, the site of the Bilderberg group 2013 meeting. Various police state measures have emerged in anticipation of ΓÇ£unrulyΓÇ¥ protests and Watford Borough Council is now refusing to honor permit applications to hold a Bilderberg Fringe Festival where Alex Jones and David Icke were scheduled to speak.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
