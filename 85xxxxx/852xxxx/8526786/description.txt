Wife by Wednesday (The Weekday Brides #1) by Catherine Bybee (October 5th 2011) 

Blake Harrison:
Rich, titled, and charmingΓÇªand in need of a wife by Wednesday. Blake turns to Sam Elliot, who isnΓÇÖt the businessman he expected. Instead, Blake is faced with Samantha Elliot, beautiful and feisty with a voice men call 1-900 numbers to hear.

Samantha Elliot:
Owner of matchmaking firm Alliance and not on the marital menuΓÇªthat is, until Blake offers her ten million dollars for a one-year contract. And thereΓÇÖs nothing indecent about this proposal. The money will really help with her familyΓÇÖs medical bills. All Samantha will need to do is keep her attraction to her new husband to herself and avoid his bed. 

But BlakeΓÇÖs toe-curling kisses and sexy charm prove too difficult for Sam to resist. It was a marriage contract that planned for everythingΓÇªexcept falling in love. 

Married by Monday (The Weekday Brides #2) by Catherine Bybee (June 5th 2012) 

Carter Billings: 
Sandy blond hair and Hollywood good looks, Carter Billings could have any woman he wants. However, when he makes his bid for the Governor's seat in the state of California, he needs to settle down and become a family man. Eliza, the woman he secretly adores, embodies the perfect amount of spice and passion to suit his marital needs, but sheΓÇÖs not interested in becoming Mrs. Billings. She can't even stand to be in the same room with him.

Eliza Havens:
ItΓÇÖs much easier to drive Carter away than to give into desire. Matching couples is how she earns a living, but getting married isnΓÇÖt an option. The secrets she carries are too dangerous to entangle anyone else. When her hidden identity and past threaten her future, sheΓÇÖs left with little choice. Carter is quick to offer solutions to both their problems, but saying yes could mean endangering the man sheΓÇÖs growing to love.
