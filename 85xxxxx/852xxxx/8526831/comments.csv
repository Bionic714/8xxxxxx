,dude4542,2013-06-01T05:31Z,"It changes it to a lower upload bandwith limit automatically once you have seeded 150%

to fix for future torrents
go to preferences > queuing > set minimum seeding ratio to -1.

now to fix for your current torrents:
for your current downloads you will have to right click on each one then bandwidth allowance > upload> unlimited.

It changes it to a lower limit automaticly once you have seeded 150%"
