@jc2k301

Ahahahaha, I'll let you know how the game is."
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-01T15:21Z,"@ aisac007....

Well, not trying to defend _whoa_ who is one of the biggest fucking retarded asshole twatwaffles trolls on ThePirateBay, but.....

Yeah, having multiparts is nice because it saves me the trouble of having to archive it up myself for backup purposes. Unlike a lot of people, I don't just burn off a playable copy and delete the files, which I could never understand. What the hell do I do if when my copy goes bad or stealth changes on the next dash update? Don't say download it again because; 1) it's a waste of time when I already did it once and 2) it might not still be there to download anymore. So I backup everything I download, multi-part archives spanned across regular DVD's with PAR set. I usually DL from the newsgroups for this reason, as all the work is already done for me. Only resorted to torrents as of late is because finding working free usenet servers with binaries is becoming a ripe pain in the ass now a days since 'just4today' went dead. 

Unlike _whoa_, however, I understand the different netiquettes of different services, and realize that torrent people don't like multi part archives because they aren't necessary as you aren't dealing with the message size limits of usenet or file size limits of web sharing."
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-01T15:30Z,"Speaking of _Whoa_. All his comments are gone. Including his ""positive"" comments in the torrents where the original multi-part usenet archive was posted. 

I'm hoping that is a sign that his account got deleted. "
,tfox71,2013-06-01T17:28Z,Works with trucate method (clonecd)?

,nagiso,2013-06-01T18:57Z,anybody else get topology data Blank?? or is it just me??
,Assassinprofessor,2013-06-01T20:24Z,"man i've been dloading for hours n i dont get more than 2kbs, wtf..where's HeroMaster when u need it"
,misterburnz,2013-06-01T20:45Z,"@AssassinProfessor - Started the download this morning 6/1/2013 around 8:25 a.m.  To even my surprise, was finished before 11. There is a shit ton of leechers, don't get me wrong, but it may have something to do on your end. I've got 30 Mb/s down and only 5 up.. nothing special. Speed seemed to stay consistant around 2 meg's per second throughout most of the download as well. 

HeroMaster isn't going to make everything ok, only the community as a whole can do that. Having a solid quick connection helps as well. =) Good luck mang."
,misterburnz,2013-06-01T20:49Z,"@nagiso  - open the folder containing our ISO and Disc Image file. Right click the ISO, click properties. 
UNCHECK Read Only. Apply. Ok. 

Run through AGBX, selecting the norm. (Check for AnyDVD style Corruption, Check/Fix Video padding, patch even if stealth passes, Level 3 - Autofix, etc.)

This will repair the empty topology data. I initially had the exact same error, and was unable to rectify it within AGBX. Noticed the file had been made read-only by the author.  Hope this helped."

,Smallz94,2013-06-10T00:24Z,"Guys just in case but i copied this from misterbunz

heres the steps if you cant find the topology data.

open the folder containing our ISO and Disc Image file. Right click the ISO, click properties. 
UNCHECK Read Only. Apply. Ok. 

Run through AGBX, selecting the norm. (Check for AnyDVD style Corruption, Check/Fix Video padding, patch even if stealth passes, Level 3 - Autofix, etc.)

This will repair the empty topology data. I initially had the exact same error, and was unable to rectify it within AGBX. Noticed the file had been made read-only by the author. Hope this helped."
,nrdidin,2013-06-12T19:28Z,dont work
,dimadesu,2013-06-12T23:25Z,"Hi guys! Wasted 2 disks, got desperate and depressed and... got it working =).
Had ""media unrecognized"" error, later ""Failed to authorize disk"".

1. Run it through AGBX with options that people noted in comments  to patch topology - or else it won't run on modded consoles.
2. Burn it with ImgBurn with Truncate option
3. Then don't install it on hard drive. In case you tried to install go ahead and remove it or else it will give ""Failed to authorize disk"" error.
4. Enjoy playing!

Cheers."
,aisac007,2013-06-14T13:29Z,just get RGH and forget about burning stuff
,lslove,2013-06-15T03:39Z,"@iceplayer92986 those disc's are junk. Use Verbatim's, any others will be hit or miss. The Verbatim's are great media, and if you still get an error atelast now it will be narrowed to bad files or bad burn."
