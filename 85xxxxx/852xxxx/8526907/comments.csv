,Reaper1218,2013-06-01T04:11Z,Do you happen to have any chucky movies?
,ht0fff,2013-06-01T04:28Z,stuck at 7% - no seeders....
,TheBlackProject,2013-06-01T06:37Z,"Hi, Judas. Could you please upload Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009) in 1080p quallity? I think that was a good movie and deserves to be collected. Please, please, please :) :)"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-01T07:25Z,"I don't happen to have that movie TheBlackProject, sorry...

Reaper, unfortunately no chucky movies on hand either :(

ht0fff, patients, There have been 2 seeders going steady, unfortunately i'm limited to 58kbps total bandwidth, and can only seed to 3 people at the same time. Currently there is over 100 leechers, this leaves the leechers to share amongst themselves, and unfortunately it doesn't always work out very well amongst each other initially.

Takes me on average about 24 hours for a torrent I upload to get enough seeders around."
,eroticburps,2013-06-01T09:41Z,dhjudasx - hellboy II - the golden army
,ht0fff,2013-06-01T23:29Z,"@dhjudasx thanks for the info. I just came across your awesome rips and they are worth waiting for...

I can seed with up to 12 MB/s and I'll seed this one for at least 50 GB."
,buenio,2013-06-02T07:25Z,"@JUDAS why all of your uploads are not so Good in 55"" TV??? but still watchable. thanks"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-02T17:39Z,"depends on the tv... I watch my encodes on a 55,65 and a few on a 82"" tv and they look hell of a lot better than cable/satellite.

you can't expect exact bluray quality from super compressed x264... close but never exact. Some movies just were never great even on the real physical bluray... plenty of bad blurays out there."
,pro346pro,2013-06-03T05:50Z,Yeah would have to agree even bluray can be bad quality some down loaders don't realise that rips can only be as good or bad as the source used and since these are all taken from an actual bluray blame the people that done the bluray! Or the filmmaker 
,onlyHD,2013-06-03T07:54Z,@judas: By any chance can you do TITANIC ?
,onlyHD,2013-06-03T08:15Z,With extras if may i add :)
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-03T08:17Z,"Well I can't say i'm always doing a fantastic job either.. but I generally do a side by side and overlay comparison to see how things are going..

As I've said in the past though, I ride that very fine edge of reasonably decent quality for the size, and turning into a garbled mush of pixels. I do leave a good chunk of breathing room for most cases.

I may go back and do up Uber high end encodes of more popular movies in a all out 4.37gb style.... MAYBE... but I doubt it.

I did just finish watching this movie on a relatively highend LED LCD Samsung tv... and after having watching the bluray first and the encoded one right after, I must say that the encoded version really is pretty well on the money for such a big format 1080p TV..... even on the 55"" 4k TV it looks pretty damn good.

I really would like to get my hands on some 4k material..."
,pro346pro,2013-06-03T13:21Z,your movies look great on a 55 inch plasma! people might want to play around with settings on the tv and ive found playing with the colour settings on my wd media player makes a huge differnce

,pro346pro,2013-06-03T13:25Z,nearly forgot its good that if your doing bigger encodes that you stay under4.37gb as i still burn data discs and watch on my bluray player when im low on space on portable hds such a thoughtful uploader you are!
,buenio,2013-06-03T15:04Z,"@Judas this is the brand of my Brandnew TV which I brought last week SONY 55"" HX855 BRAVIA Full HD 3D TV but when I'm watching your encodes on my 9 month old SONY 40"" 40EX430 BRAVIA FULL HD TV your movies are perfect. dhjudasx you are the best uploader out there that have The Best Bluray Quality Movies for such small file size so thanks you don't need to add more Bitrates that can cause a size of your movies because many people here including me have slow Internet Connection.  "
,kito67,2013-06-03T21:43Z,Thank you for all your quality work.I know i'm not the only one untilnow but please give me an advice please.Wich is better between StaxRip and XMedia Recode.Thank you again and i wait your answer. 
,ht0fff,2013-06-04T01:23Z,"@dhjudasx did you rip only the first 2 underworld movies, or did I miss the other 2? because the screenshots suggest that you have all 4 movies..."
,ht0fff,2013-06-04T08:32Z,"@dhjudasx I've noticed that foreign parts are not hard coded. any chance you could either hardcode the non-english parts or provide a separate .srt file for these dialogs?
If you watch the original Blu-ray, foreign parts are usually automatically shown in English, but if you watch the rips, you have to watch the entire movie with subs to get the subtitles for the foreign parts. this is a little bit annoying, other than that your rips are awesome quality in video and audio. Thanks for all the hard work!"
,iamspellborn,2013-06-04T12:34Z,"@dhjudasx Do u have ""Machete"" ? The sequel will be out in a few months and i must watch the original first, but i can't find a good rip anywhere..."
,jwinston78,2013-06-05T06:38Z,"just curious, why the audio are encoded @ 24khz?? isnt 44 or 48 khz is far more crisper and sound natural?? i guess a few megabytes more for 48khz aac51 encode is better.. cos the video encode is already stellar, thanks.."
,kito67,2013-06-05T12:27Z,@dhjudasx do you have in plan to encode some animation movies like Shrek Quadrilogy or Ice Age?
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-05T23:45Z,"first:

ht0fff

I don't hardcode subtitles for several reasons.... and while it is true most blurays do provide subtitles only for the foreign, the actual method still uses the full subtitles... it's a BD content thing.

To try and go through and manually cut out everything but the foreign parts is a bit of a pain. I'd suggest subscene or another site for only foreign parts.

Additionally yes i'm waiting on getting the last 2 underworlds up as well as Narnia and harry potter movies.

jwinston78

The Audio IS 24/48khz, it's the method and type of AAC encoding...  It is in fact outputting at 48khz 16bit.... If you are reading that off the basic properties of the file or the ps3 screen.. ignore it... it's not entirely true.

Read up on HE-AAC/LC v2+ format, it'll explain more in how it combines several methods to produce the best possible audio.

I do plan to get shrek and ice age up... don't worry... And I don't happen to have machete atm... but that may change."
,buenio,2013-06-06T05:03Z,@dhjudasx my opinion is why did you buy blurays instead of renting if you only ripping it? it saves you a lot of money.
,buenio,2013-06-06T05:08Z,@dhjudasx my opinion is Just rent a bluray instead of buying it if you only ripping it and it saves you a lot of money.
,ht0fff,2013-06-06T07:11Z,"@dhjudasx ok, thx for the info. 

I thought you could just specify several subtitle tracks at the same time when ripping the blu-ray and you get 2 .srt files. 
the hardcoding was just another idea, but I do understand that hardcoding is not the best solution (I don't really like hardcoded subs, but it's better than not understanding what people say). 

ususally the foreign parts track is one of the higher numered ones, but if you can't rip several at the same time, then never mind. Thanks again for the info. Your rips are really awesome."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-06T07:22Z,"because you can't rent blurays here at all.... and I prefer to own them...

Block buster, Rogers, redbox, etc. and so forth rental places have been gone for almost half a decade. Bankrupt and gone.

Plus the closest one that I could have went to when it was still around, is still 200 mile round trip. Not worth it. More expensive to drive for 3 movies then to just buy them."
,kito67,2013-06-06T09:15Z,"Please again answer to my question.I want your opinion about wich is the best between StaxRip and XMedia Recode.I want to choose one of them to encode DVD to max quality in 720p.I know,i could search on Google from many tutorials but i want your opinion first."
,buenio,2013-06-06T11:11Z,@dhjudasx is there a chance you can upload Kill bill vol.1 and 2 (uncensored volume much better) in the future thanks.
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-06T17:33Z,"kito67 sorry..

I haven't used the xmedia.

But if you are sourcing a DVD.. DO NOT encode it at 720p... make certain to keep it original and encode it as an interlaced version... DO NOT DE-INTERLACE...

Reference my last mimzy dvd encode I did.."
,kito67,2013-06-06T20:36Z,"Thank you very much for your answer.I don't understand what you want to say with ""Reference my last mimzy dvd encode I did"" .I have 2 DVD's with movies White Noise 1 & 2 and i want to convert in mp4 with max quality."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-06T23:30Z,"i was mentioning this

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7659514/The_Last_Mimzy_%282007%29_DVD_%5B480i%5D__5.1__-_Judas

If you download and look at it.. use media info if you like you can see kinda what i did with the movie.... i did my best to keep the source as is... and encode it maintaining the same resolution and interlacing. Mind you x264 kinda does a hybrid interlace.. but it does improve the image quality OVER using de-interlacing while encoding.

You'll also see what i used for bitrates too."
,kito67,2013-06-07T07:19Z,Thank you again! I will try to find more info about this subject and to learn how to use staxrip or something like this to optain max quality from DVD's.Until then i wait your next movie.
