Here I give you some of most populated printers software for use with recycled toner cartridges and there new system chips.
First-install the universal driver. 
Second-unrar the firmware for the specific device. 
Third-drag .bat file on the .exe file and wait the downloading procces

Its strongly recomendent to not power off the device and for some printers wich are wireless connected, You have to connect them with usb during the procedure.

Enjoy.
