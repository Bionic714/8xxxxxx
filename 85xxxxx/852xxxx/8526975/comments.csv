Thx for the up anyways.."
,terroncro,2013-06-04T16:30Z,"it will install, only you must extract it using some kind ISO reader or something like that (magicISO is what I use). After you extract it, rename all setup-1.bin into install-1.bin watch out that your numbers at the end of word setup match with the one in the renamed install-""number"".bin like

setup-1.bin = install-1.bin
setup-2.bin = install-2.bin
.....etc..."
