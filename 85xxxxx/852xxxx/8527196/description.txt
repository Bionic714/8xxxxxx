Sociopolitical Documentary with no narration published by Zeppers in 2011 - English language


Information
------------------------------

"I'm 22 years old and I must have killed 30 people. The same thing that you were given badges for over in Iraq, would have you considered a serial killer over here. That's a very weird thought to have running around in your head when it's dark, going to sleep or late at night."
There is no place for doubt, sadness and fear in the American army.
Still, many soldiers struggle with these feelings. Beer is Cheaper than Therapy portrays what goes on behind the facade of heroism and the 'John Wayne mentality'.
