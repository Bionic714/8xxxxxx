,bgg1175,2013-06-04T14:03Z,"Ahh! Some Jim Lee from his prime that I havent seen! 
Thanks so much! "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T17:56Z,"you're both welcome. and yeah, jim tore it up on this book. i suspect that he had so few hours for drawing when he was publisher, that it influenced his decision to sell his company. (since the sale he's been able to draw the batman series, superman, all-star batman and robin, and justice league, and probably others i've forgotten.)"
,kakuichi1,2013-06-06T05:15Z,"God, this was one of my favorite comics.  I had autographed variants of the 1/2, 0, 1 and some of the others.  But, the delays killed me and I stopped waiting and recently finished the series a while ago.  Even killed me more since I'm about to move & I had to sell my collection.  

As soon as I saw the 1st episode of CHUCK, I figured that somebody else definitely was a fan of this comic series.

Thanks for this UL!  Great Job with everything!"
