First-ever TV documentary about the legendary soul singer Otis Redding,
following him from childhood and marriage to the Memphis studios and
segregated Southern clubs where he honed his unique stage act and voice.
Through unseen home movies, the film reveals how Otis's 1967 tour of
Britain dramatically changed his life and music. After bringing soul to
Europe he returned to conquer America, first with the 'love-crowd' at
the Monterey Festival and then with Dock of the Bay, which topped the
charts only after his death at just 26. Includes rare and unseen
performances, intimate interviews with Otis's wife and daughter, and
with original band members Steve Cropper and Booker T Jones. Also
featured are British fans whose lives were changed by seeing him, among
them Rod Stewart, Tom Jones and Bryan Ferry.
