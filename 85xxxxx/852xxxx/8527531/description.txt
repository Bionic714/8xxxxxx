A little game I made called "Null". Based off of Zork, Null is a text-based open-world game where you roam what remains of Earth in hopes that you can dominate all that remains. It is still a work in progress and will constantly be updated. To install the game, all you have to do is extract the files to a desired directory and launch Null.exe.

CHEATS/COMMANDS:
F1- After an NPC warns you about their strength level, press F1 when focused on the form to have the battle simulated 100 times. If you win 80% or more of the time, the game will tell you to attack.
F2- Press F2 when focused on the form to start up Al. Al will play for you when you're AFK by attacking NPCs and buying potions. Although he has a 15% of killing you, he is very useful. He will only play when you are focused on the form.
F3- When focused on the form, press F3 to stop Al from playing and give control to yourself.
Grave key(~) or Tilde(`)- When focused on the input textbox, press this key to open the developer's console, giving you serveral commands to play/cheat with.

UP ARROW- When focused on the input textbox, press the up arrow and it will automatically input either RUN, TALK, IGNORE, or TRADE based on the context.
