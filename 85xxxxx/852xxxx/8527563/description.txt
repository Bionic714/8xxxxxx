Install options:
Windows 8 Pro VL 64-Bit
Windows 8 Pro VL 64-Bit KMS Pre-Activated

KMS Pre-activated index is Pre-Activated with KMSnano v.25 and re-activated whenever you boot with 30 days or less left on your activation.

People often ask in the comments which version of windows 8 I would recommend for them. Well, folks, for x64 people, this is the one I would recommend. Pro VL has the least likely chance of developing activation problems since the only offline method
we have come up with for bypassing security is KMS. Enterprise has Windows 8 To Go and Hyper-V but most people don't use that.

If a future problem arises and a newer activation method is needed, you can run the Uninstall-KMSnano.cmd in the folder:
windows_setup_kmsnano
This will delete the scheduled task and remove the kmsnano files.

I'm not sure if smartscreen filter will bother with scheduled tasks and scripted tasks, but if it does, turn it off in action center in the control panel - system and security.
Allow any related programs through any firewall programs
and A/V updates. (False positive in future for the KMSnano activator)
