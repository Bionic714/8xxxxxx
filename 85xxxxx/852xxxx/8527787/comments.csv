,asc11,2013-06-03T08:55Z,"Thanks for the clarification -- I guess you found a second source for the audio of those three. But the URL you gave, 8527787, is THIS torrent."

,garycarradine,2013-06-08T05:32Z,thanks for uploading this. ive always wanted to see all the colorized films of cagney and bogart. i just hope that they were in a higher resolution like 720x480 :))
,cgculpepper,2013-06-08T06:36Z,"a few of them were , as i ripped some from dvd.
-but the quality was no better , still painted."
,garycarradine,2013-06-11T18:16Z,cgculpepper: really? So some of them came from dvds? so Which of the films were from dvds? :))
,garycarradine,2013-06-12T20:13Z,"cgculpepper: can you upload the colorized films that you mentioned that are from dvd? I would love to see those in dvd's, even if the quality is poor. hope to hear from you soon :)) "
,cgculpepper,2013-06-13T15:32Z,"

Why? -the quality is no better and the audio is Russian!
other than cropping out vhs tracking lines in some , there is NO visible difference in the picture quality
