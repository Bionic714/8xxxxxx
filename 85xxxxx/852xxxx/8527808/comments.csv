good small rips with subs.
Big Thanks."

Thank you very much for your work, i'll be checking TPB regularly for the rest of the episodes from you. Good video quality, small size and included subs, it's excellent."

Your uploads of Arrested Development Season 4 are by FAR the BEST rips available in 720! Much smaller yet much higher quality than all the other ones. Keep up the great work, hopefully you'll crank out the entire season in this 720 format!"

I appreciate that you liked the uploads, and yes i'll upload the whole season."

You're welcome. And i'll upload the episodes separately."
