Discover a new world In the middle of the 16th century Spanish  explorers
and warriors reached the shores of  America,  the  famous  Conquistadores

They ventured into territory no European has entered before in the  search
for gold, fame and adventure. What they found was a world completly  alien
to them - bringing civilization as well as war and terror  to  the  native
tribes

You are one the conquistadores: Choose your path wisely Every action  has
its consquences - you can choose to battle the savages  and  civilize  the
vast green jungles, or you can side with  the  natives  and  defend  their
homeland against the foreign invasion

Each battle will define your fate
