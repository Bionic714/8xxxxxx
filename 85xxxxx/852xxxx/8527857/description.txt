Description :
"Alice in Wonderland" - is one of the most incredible and
bizarre stories ever to tell the world under the guise of a fairy-
tale. Now, co-author of the legendary Doom turned it all upside
down. The game easily crossed the limits of permitted when dealing
with a literary source, turning a classic story in a shell of
black humor and grotesque. Alice grew up and got into a madhouse. Wonderland has undergone a lot of change: the Cheshire cat walks
with an earring in his ear, adoring caterpillar mushrooms is suffering from drug addiction, the forests are full of monsters
and ghosts darting about the palaces. Bloody kitchen knife and a
true homing deck cards to help re-establish order Alice in
dreamland.
