Revista.De.La.Liga.28th.May.2013.480p.x264-SM


   Scott Minto and Guillem Balague are joined by Albert Ferrer and Graham Hunter
 ahead of the final round of La Liga matches in this week's Revista de La Liga.

  The team will chat about the major transfer news of the week - possibly the
 season - which saw Brazil superstar Neymar agree to join Barcelona from
 Santos.

  They'll also discuss the health and future of Barca coach Tito Vilanova,
 and ask just who will be in charge of Real Madrid next season and whether
 he will have Cristiano Ronaldo at his disposal?


NOTE: A few VIDEO GLITCHES but watchable!
