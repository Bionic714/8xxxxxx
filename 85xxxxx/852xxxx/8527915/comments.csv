[V],TorDigger,2013-06-01T18:45Z,@black_arrows96: with Avast! company...lol
,black_arrows96,2013-06-01T20:02Z,can't you provide us that
,icek00l,2013-06-03T10:13Z,"The only type of apps I don't dl from tpb are security apps like this, the only reason being, that the licence keys/codes are usually quickly recognised & blacklisted, so therefore, can I ask, if this is the case with this Avast?

Regardless, thank you very much for the upload"

Lol with any decent software illegal licenses will be blocked, if it wouldn't be that way the software itself would suck, as you can see how much they care about it. Anyways you can avoid that just by not updating the software, you can update the engine and virus definitions."
,maitkarro,2013-06-10T12:25Z,"Weird there are 6 comments but I see only 5. 
Anyways I wanted to add that you need to disable program update along with software update, you can manually then update under maintenance the engine/virus definitions."
