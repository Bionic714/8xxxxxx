Avast! Internet Security

Stops theft of your personal data, intrusions of your privacy, email scams, viruses, and spyware. A comprehensive solution that also includes all our Pro Antivirus features.

Features:

Go beyond antivirus to protect yourself
avast! Internet Security provides complete antivirus, anti-spyware, antispam, and firewall protection, complemented by remote assistance options, a software updater, and avast! SafeZoneΓäó, built specifically for online shopping and banking threats youΓÇÖll encounter in 2013.

Make sure your identity stays yours alone
Our built-in silent firewall blocks hackers and other unauthorized entry attempts to steal sensitive personal data from your PC. Plus, email spam and phishing attacks are prevented with built-in anti-spam.

Shop and bank online without worry
SafeZoneΓäó is a private and isolated virtual window on your desktop, for securing your sensitive financial transactions online. Perfect for auction sites, buying tickets, booking hotels or airlines, online gaming, or any sort of monetary transfer.

Surf and socialize without worry
Sandbox lets you surf the web and run even risky programs virtually, outside your PC. And our Web, IM, and P2P shields ensure your safety on social networks (e.g.or Twitter) and online dating sites, IM chats (e.g. Skype or ICQ), or peer-to-peer file-sharing sites.

Benefit from real-time protection
Hybrid cloud technology streams your virus database updates to your PC in real-time, so your avast! software has all virus definitions as soon as they are known to our Virus Lab.

Know whatΓÇÖs coming before you click
Our cloud-based FileRep feature keeps reputation data on millions of files, so we can warn you of a fileΓÇÖs reputation before you open it.

Manage avast! on all your devices
Your AVAST Account portal is your personal directory for all your avast! related data, for all your desktop and mobile devices. Each month, we also prepare for you a Security Report that shows an overview of the most significant details (e.g. number of infected sites blocked).

Get help from a ΓÇÿGeekΓÇÖ in your network
Our Remote Assistance lets you connect remotely to friends or family members for computer help. It routes through AVASTΓÇÖs servers, bypasses firewalls, and can be terminated by either party at any time.
