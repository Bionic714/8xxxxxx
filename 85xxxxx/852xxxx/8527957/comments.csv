The only thing I can find about a game called ""The Last Alliance"" is a project that went defunct before 2012 when it was officially announced that the project was discontinued indefinitely.  I have not been able to find any record of a 2013 RPG called The Last Alliance, so everyone, beware if you download this, as it is likely to be a jumbled up, bug ridden, unfinished game that you'll wish you hadn't wasted the time to download."
