Apparently the guy that wrote this album posted a torrent of the FLAC (and MP3) encodings of the 96KHz, 24-bit exports of the tracks from Reason.

Then he said that, if we like it, to pass it along.

So that's what I'm doing.




(He also said that if we like it enough to buy it, then to please do that too.)
