Many thanks for another superb upload, one that will hopefully introduce Mann to a new generation of readers."

Let me know if you find any errors in these uploads -- missing pages, out of order pages, missing punctuation, missing text, pages not aligned properly, etc. I'll fix whatever it's possible to fix."
