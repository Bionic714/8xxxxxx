Senior Cabinet minister Aiden Hoynes (David Tennant) and his wife Freya Gardner (Emily Watson) are a high-flying golden political couple. Hoynes resigns from his post as part of a planned leadership bid - which is thwarted by his friend, the equally ambitious (and hugely devious) Bruce Babbish (Ed Stoppard) who was aided by Chief Whip Marcus Brock (Roger Allam).

Away from Westminster, husband and wife face an uncertain future as they come to terms with the diagnosis that Noah (Oscar Kennedy) has Asperger's syndrome.
