,WonderPirate24,2013-06-02T06:18Z,"Walmart is one of the largest Department Stores in the
world. I do most of My shopping there! Really! but
apparently now, they seem to be handing out free game updates
to the public! And get this! These updates are being handed
out before the Game companies and the top mayor game crackers
are even aware of what's going on! Talking about customer satisfaction!
I don't know about you! but I'm getting my updates at Walmart!
But kidding aside! Keep up the good work Walmart! You done good!"
