,Toffer_15,2013-06-06T00:23Z,"Possible solutions

1. switching from 8CH to 2CH (worked for me)
2. Editing CommonSettings.pro and changing the setting ""isFullscreen"" to ""False"" did the trick for me as well, and turning off Vsync never hurts.
3. Updating video card drivers / .NET might help as well"
