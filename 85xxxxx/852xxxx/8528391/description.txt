In de afgelopen eeuw zijn duizenden mensen vermist geraakt. 
Plotseling en onverklaarbaar keren 4400 vermiste personen allemaal tegelijk terug; en ze zijn niets veranderd. 
Niet wetend wat deze ingrijpende gebeurtenis betekent, onderzoekt de overheid de 4400 mensen om erachter te komen waar ze zijn geweest en waarom ze zijn teruggekeerd. 
Het wordt al gauw duidelijk dat hun aanwezigheid de mensheid zal veranderen op een manier die niemand ooit had kunnen voorzien.
