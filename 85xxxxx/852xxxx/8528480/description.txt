Britain's Stone Age Tsunami
A Time-Team Special 
Tony Robinson reveals new evidence that shows how a huge tsunami swamped the east coast of Britain 8,000 years ago, and explores the lives of those it affected. For years, these Mesolithic communities were thought to be primitive hunter-gatherers, but through archaeological excavation, Tony discovers they were living comfortable existences in their own houses, with varied diets and sophisticated skills. Scientists take him on a virtual journey through the rich landscape of Doggerland - the area of dry land that connected Britain to Europe - which was destroyed by the wave and persistent flooding.
New research is revealing just how much devastation it brought to the land and its people.
