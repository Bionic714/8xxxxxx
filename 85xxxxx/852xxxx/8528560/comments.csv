GTFO to you too :)"

Thanks for the upload

@bluebug99
Honestly, don't complain.
At least he uploaded it, regardless of the language. 
As for the .rap, it CAN be transferred via FTP, but USb is easier for most of us who use external drives to play games. 
Also, if someone doesn't know what reactpsn is, then they shouldn't be looking for pkgs to install. Google has all the answers."
,ady3004,2013-06-03T10:32Z,please xblades for ps3
,bluebug99,2013-06-03T16:24Z,"Hi saif_khan

,hotd54me,2013-06-05T01:45Z,"FIX: for language, from the main menu there is 5 options at the start, go to the 4th option down hit x, then on the next menu, go to the 5th option down and hit x, then change all 3 of those options to english, it will ask you if you want to download a patch for that language, hit yes, and you're good to go! if you don't have access to psn, then you can only change text and subtitles to english, if you do then you can download the speech pack. Enjoy! :) oh, and stop bashing on the uploader, he uploaded whatever he could find, i don't see anyone else taking the time to upload anything?"
,s1r1,2013-06-05T12:17Z,@hotd54me Confirmed working in english 4.40 Rebug
,Gros_Shadok,2013-06-07T06:57Z,"Thanks dirtdmr for your reply. I've never used an emulator but I really want to try this game on PC, so I hope you advice will help me do so. And if the demo works on emulator, I'll see if I can make the whole game work too."
,Gros_Shadok,2013-06-07T06:59Z,"Oups... the software you are talking about is not a PS3 emulator on PC. Too bad.
Could someone recommend me an emulator in order to try to make this demo work on a PC ?
Thanks"
,bluebug99,2013-06-07T20:29Z,"please saif_khan upload something i really begeun to worry about you, please do not take my previous comments seriously
