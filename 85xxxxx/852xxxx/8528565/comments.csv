,plagasx,2013-06-01T19:32Z,THIS UPDATE DELETED MY SAVES!
,Kona_Guy,2013-06-01T19:38Z,use the original crack you used before and your saves will be accessible
,Insomneac,2013-06-01T23:58Z,"Fucking noobs, your saves aren't deleted.

Different cracks use different save paths, just check the ini file for the path and move your old saves."
,Shoulon,2013-06-02T05:27Z,Insomneac - Lmao. but yeah he is right.
,Dewarton,2013-06-02T05:28Z,i think we don't need previous updates but can someone confirm plz ?
,D882w,2013-06-02T20:58Z,"I'll be the idiot then.

Restoring the original crack isn't recovering my saves after this update.  Nor can I figure out the save directories.

Any help would be appreciated."
,damada21,2013-06-03T06:23Z,"To fix saves, 
1) Start the game and get to the first save, where it tells you to use wasd to move
2) Exit the game and go to Documents4a gamesMetro LL, there will now be two folders
3) Copy the contents of your original folder (the one with stuff in it) to the folder which should only have an autosave file
4) Saves should be back"
,ronan17,2013-06-03T13:38Z,"Update worked as it should, no problems, thank you."
,kala78,2013-06-04T18:02Z,"First of all thank you for the upload.
I installed the limited edition from GameWorks and after this update I don't have ranger mode and the other extras. Does anybody have an idea how to fix this?"
,f33d13ack,2013-06-05T22:18Z,"My game now displays ""PHYSX>CPU"" in green lettering at the top left side of the screen.  Any ideas how to make it go away??  I couldn't find any options on it in settings.. maybe I'm missing something."
,remotehugger2,2013-06-11T17:42Z,so do we need the other updates first or are they included with this repack ?
,Viciously,2013-06-13T13:20Z,"@f33d, change that in Nvidia control panel.

You must have turned it on and now you are acting like an idiot."
,Millor1,2013-06-15T09:02Z,So... this crack removes ranger mode or what?
