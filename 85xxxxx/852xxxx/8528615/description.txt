No Death, No Fear: Comforting Wisdom for Life by Thich Nhat Hanh
English | ISBN: 1573223336 | edition 2003 | PDF | 208 pages | 4,9 mb

Beloved Buddhist teacher and poet Thich Nhat Hanh offered the world much-needed words of calming wisdom in his previous book, Anger-a coast-to-coast bestseller in both hardcover and paperback.

Now, in a book both timely and timeless, he tackles a subject that has been contemplated by Buddhist monks and nuns for twenty-five hundred years-and an eternal mystery that touches us all: What is death? Through Zen parables, guided meditations, and personal stories, he explodes the traditional myths of how we live and die. Even more, Thich Nhat Hanh shows us a way to live a life unfettered by fear.
