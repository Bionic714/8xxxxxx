,PetaFlux,2013-06-02T09:42Z,"Vad oväntat. 
Ännu en dos kulturmarxistisk hatpropaganda riktat mot den nordiska rasen. 
Budskapet är relativt enkelt. 
Vikingar var homosexuella pedofiler, allt ackompanjerat till negermusik (dubstep).

Naturligtvis är även den obligatoriska inkvoterade pk-negern med i slutet av filmen. 

Skräp - ladda inte ner!"

M: Horrible. 
This says it all;
""""Hammer of the Gods"" is a disappointment. The story telling does not justify the carnage by knife, sword and axe that seems to occur every 4 or 5 minutes. Development of the main characters is not compelling. I wanted to like this movie."""

,MailerDaemon0,2013-06-03T00:12Z,"It's Spartacus meets the 300 meets the Discovery Channel series Vikings with none of what made each of those shows classics..

It tries to look like 300 and Spartacus with its over the top violence but falls short of both.

Technically, the torrent is almost perfect.

M: Mere words will NEVER be able to describe how craptastic this movie really is.

Watch it for the violence if you are in to that because there's little else to watch it for..."

,p0rchh0nky,2013-06-03T20:25Z,"If you like the ""Vikings"" tv series (writing, acting and realism of the era) you'll enjoy the movie.
If you like Action movies like Iron Man or Transformers you won't.
Hopefully, that helps in your decision cause it seems peeps either love it or hate it."

Don't get this mixed up with the real Vikings series that just recently ended it's first season.  Although Ragdah's brother is also in this film.  I'm no movie critic but I know ""sucks"" when I see it."
,mac_user777,2013-06-04T07:50Z,Movie 10/10 so far!
,onggo,2013-06-04T10:56Z,cool
,GeorgeMack,2013-06-04T15:43Z,"Well it's started ok a cool sort of battle, but honest the acting and the choice of actors with such a small build... The Vikings were feared because of their fierce, and leveling raids. These scrawny brats ain't them, I'm guessing it's halloween. Proud to have lasted 30 minutes. Beat that "

This movie is probably as good has an episode of vikings, which is not much. I enjoyed it overall, but wouldnt pay the movie ticket if it was half the price."

,Guitarmarc47,2013-06-05T11:23Z,"They spend tens of millions of dollars making these ""epic"" movies and I could barely make it through the trailer, Horrible film I wouldn't even waste the time downloading it. I'm sure the film was well recorded don't   misunderstand that, but it isn't worthy of anyone's' time....sorry."
,zakimar5,2013-06-05T21:27Z,"So far we have this movie rated between -10 and +10, so unless you can give a reason for your rating, keep it to yourself.

Some people said it was boring, and others that there was too much violence, both of which aren't helpful. Bad acting, poorly shot, horrible dialogue, cheap sets... would be useful things to criticize."
,GeorgeMack,2013-06-06T17:06Z,"ok zakimar5 you pose a good question there. 

If you've ever acquainted with the norse folks you would know that they were fierce to look at and had quite a big build.

This film had this medium build kids ( and i'm being generous here) to pose as the mighty vikings. EPIC fail

Acting light and most of the times moronic, the kids even act below their age.

Script...don't get me started, you think you're going somewhere and then oh for fuck's sake....

Sets ok...

Dialogue, lol

And some guys even equaled this thing to Vikings. Ok to people with half a brain and above watch just one episode of Vikings and do try to compare casting, acting, script intelligence, dialogue, sets fuck it everything. I lasted i think half an hour and that was with effort. "
