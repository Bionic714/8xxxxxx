SNOOP LION -  ASHTRAYS AND HEARTBREAKS  feat. Miley Cyrus 720p E-SUBS [GWC]

The video finds Snoop and Cyrus projected on windows and glass panes, singing and rhyming about being down, but never out, intercut with city scenes of pain, violence and loneliness. Still, a few shining moments of hope eke through, including a young girl skipping rope, a reconciling couple and an old man reveling in the small joy of feeding pigeons at a park.
