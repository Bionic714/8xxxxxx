,Snowman2323,2013-06-01T14:49Z,And it's actually seeded
,EliteHaxz,2013-06-01T17:43Z,Hey you really think i cant crack you wanna learn your self k heres a tutorial its easy i don't just zip and make a installer...I hate faggots like you that dont appreciate the stuff we do for you guys just go fuck off if you dont trust this dont download it k?
,craniumbox,2013-06-01T18:33Z,"Why is the one bigger than the blackbox download?
Im not bitching Im just curious the file size?

PS: Thx for this!!!"
,Snowman2323,2013-06-01T19:30Z,"Ahahahahahahahaha!!!! And how long do you think you will be in the scene for? You can't even make the file an ISO... If any of your torrents were seeded, I would download one and look, but I bet your ""cracks"" are either scene releases, slightly edited scene releases or buggy as fuck. You don't even know how to seed your own torrent. You say I mustn't download it, I can't!!!

Why drive a bicycle when there is a free Lamborghini available? You wanna impress someone? Crack a game that isn't cracked by a scene group yet, then you will make a name. Until then, learn how to make an ISO cause no one is interested in your shady upload that was cracked weeks ago

@Craniumbox the Blackbox version is ripped and compressed so it's a much smaller download but has a longer install time. Blackbox doesn't take any files out of their rips either, they're an awesome group!!"
,craniumbox,2013-06-02T06:56Z,Thanks for the info
,EliteHaxz,2013-06-02T08:58Z,"Snowman just fuck off you don't get it don't you i said i cracked it and am a,Beginner on cracking things blackbox did it for years i just started a week ago and to make it a file smaller size you guys want me to do that ill do it don't worry, Why is it a larger size cran its because i didn't compress them blackbox compresses the file size as much as they can to make it less gb/file size!"
,Snowman2323,2013-06-02T13:49Z,"Dude, I am a programmer so when I say this I don't just suck it out my ass: if you only started cracking a week ago (and by the way you type and speak), you did NOT make this crack yourself. You did not put any work in. If anything, you edited the steam_api.dll to use whatever labels you want inside the .ini, but I don't know cause I can't download it cause you still haven't figured out how to seed a torrent. No one in a million years can crack a game from a major company when they have only been hacking at it a week. Do you even know a programming language? No, HTML and CSS are not languages, just in case you're a web designer who thought he could code. Blackbox also rips their uploads, that means they take out unnecessary files like other languages or multiplayer, it's not just compression.

Don't waste your time on this, it'll take a year to download it will probably give shit."
