,lkristian12,2013-06-02T00:46Z,"If this is good, I'll fucking seed for a week"
,dionoo7,2013-06-02T00:55Z,"best copy so far but missing the
extra scene at the end that is a
must see, but the very first copy
has it  ( the copy that looks like
it was done with a phone )
Thanks poster"
,PookaHookah,2013-06-02T05:41Z,"About what you'd expect from a cam. I find that background noise unbearable. Thank you uploader, but I think we're all better off waiting. It got terrible reviews and didn't even break even in the Box office, so a good copy will be up probably sooner rather than later."

Pretty good for cam, audio sounded like it was headphoned in so the quality was pretty good. Video was pretty good too, only a few out of focus moments that were quickly fixed, cam remained steady and centered and there was little to no flicker. missing the after credit scene but all in all a good copy. THANKS FOR THE UPLOAD!! :) :) :)"

Feels like a year back you used to be able to get tons of movies either pre-release or at least shortly after. Nowadays movies run for weeks before we get a decent rip. Don't get me wrong, i appreciate the work camers do, and that of the people who try to turn cams in to something worth watching, but i just can't shake the feeling the movie industry is finally getting ahead in the fight against pirates. And that makes me one sad puppy, mostly because i live in Shitfuck, Nowhere in Switzneyland, and our tiny cinema either doesn't show lots of good movies, or if they do, they show the german dubbed version. If you ever heard, for example, Al Pacino's german voice you'd understand how frustrating this is - Sag Hallo zu meinem kleine Freund! Shit just don't sound right. End of rant, thank you for your attention."

,MoonR1d3r,2013-06-04T17:32Z,Is it me or do i hear someone snorting at the end?
,f1ve,2013-06-05T08:06Z,"@supkids

This isn't awards season.  DVDSCRs are aplenty before the oscars, etc.  Otherwise, it's cams.  Personally, as someone from a ""western"" country living overseas, I'm thankful to these guys for putting anything up.  Otherwise, it's either not released here or it's heavily censored.  

To all the green and pink skulls.  Cheers, mates."

,robbman1,2013-06-07T09:11Z,"Apparently the stupid ass Cinavia got to this movie too, playing on PS3 won't work, question is I have PS3 Media Server, and I actually tried playing it through it hearing it works, problem was it gave me the same Content Block number 1 again, is there a server that doesn't have this issue?"
,dracsback,2013-06-09T01:09Z,"I watched it... The quality was bearable and seeing as its free, I aint complaining! U/L'd in less than 5 mins too. Thanx laval!"
