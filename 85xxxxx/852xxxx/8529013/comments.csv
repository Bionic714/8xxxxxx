,Torrent_Reviews,2013-06-07T23:32Z,"This has a nice trojan in it. A nice, win32.infostealer.zeus to be exact. Too bad it's not legit, I was actually looking forward to play it."
,Torrent_Reviews,2013-06-08T02:53Z,"In case anybody was wondering, it'd hidden away in the patcher.exe. So if you ran it, I feel sorry for you."
,bananahammich,2013-06-09T00:29Z,Has anyone else besides Torrent_Reviews detected any viruses in this torrent?
,Sean2323,2013-06-10T19:30Z,"Torrent_Reviews, If I don't run the patcher, I'm safe then, right?

Plus, who would run the patcher? I thought it didn't work for torrented copies?
Anyways, I'll comment again if I have any such encounters with viruses."
,Torrent_Reviews,2013-06-14T03:56Z,"Sean2323, I just deleted the entire torrent and re-downloaded it from another guy. But deleting the patcher.exe and running a few scans should help you get rid of any potential viruses."
