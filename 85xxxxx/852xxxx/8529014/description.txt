A bitter ex-husband. A put upon momma's boy. Both want their
respective spouse and mother dead, but who will pull it off? 

The title comes from Patti Page's 1956 hit song, "Mama from the Train
(A Kiss, A Kiss)". The film was inspired by the 1951 Alfred Hitchcock
thriller Strangers on a Train, which also plays a role in the film.

The film received mixed reviews, but was a commercial success. Anne Ramsey
was singled out for praise for her portrayal of the overbearing Mrs. Lift;
she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
