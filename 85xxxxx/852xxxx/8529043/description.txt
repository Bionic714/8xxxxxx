On the evening of March 17, 1959, as the people of Tibet braced for a violent power grab by Chinese occupiersΓÇöone that would forever wipe out any vestige of national sovereigntyΓÇöthe twenty-four-year-old Dalai Lama, TibetΓÇÖs political and spiritual leader, contemplated the impossible. The task before him was immense: to slip past a cordon of crack Chinese troops ringing his summer palace and, with an escort of 300, journey across the highest terrain in the world and over treacherous Himalayan passes to freedomΓÇöone step ahead of pursuing Chinese soldiers.
Mao Zedung, ChinaΓÇÖs ruthless Communist dictator, had pinned his hopes for total Tibetan submission on controlling the impressionable Dalai Lama. So beloved was the young rulerΓÇöso identified with his countryΓÇÖs essenceΓÇöthat for him to escape might mean perpetual resistance from a population unwilling to tolerate an increasingly brutal occupation. The Dalai LamaΓÇÖs minders sent word to the Tibetan rebels and CIA-trained guerrillas who waited on the route: His Holiness must escapeΓÇöat all costs.
In many ways, the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was unprepared for the epic journey awaiting him. Twenty-two years earlier, government search parties, guided by prophecies and omens, had arrived at the boyΓÇÖs humble peasant home and subjected the two-year-old to a series of tests. After being declared the reincarnation of TibetΓÇÖs previous ruler, the boy was brought to Lhasa to learn the secrets of Buddhism and the ways of ultimate power. Forced in the ensuing two decades to cope with aching loneliness and often stifling ritualΓÇöand compelled to suppress his mischievous personalityΓÇöGyatso eventually proved himself a capable leader. But no previous Dalai Lama had ever taken on a million Communist Chinese soldiers bent on stamping out Tibetan freedom.
