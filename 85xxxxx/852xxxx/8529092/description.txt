On The Baptist GeneralsΓÇÖ sophomore album, the word ΓÇ£heartΓÇ¥ repeats eight times. The Denton, TX band, known for its haunting, claustrophobic take on drunken folk, needed ten full years to bare its heartsΓÇöone of which is in the album title, Jackleg Devotional to the Heart, a name that songwriter Chris Flemmons conjured shortly after he recorded, and then trashed, the albumΓÇÖs first attempt in 2005.

Flemmons goes so far as to call this his ΓÇ£love album,ΓÇ¥ and itΓÇÖs an apt descriptionΓÇöthough love through The Baptist GeneralsΓÇÖ eyes is plenty complicated. JacklegΓÇÿs hearts donΓÇÖt resemble valentines. No smooth curls into a final point. The bandΓÇÖs vibraphones, guitarrons and ambient feedback combine like a mess of ventricles, aortas and veinsΓÇönot to mention, from the sound of it, all of the blood spilled while Jackleg lurched for years toward an eventual finish line.

Call it a love record, then. ItΓÇÖs the kind of love Flemmons had to figure out in the ten years since The Baptist GeneralsΓÇÖ critically-acclaimed 2003 full-length debut No Silver/No Gold, a period in which he admits heΓÇÖs fallen in love with a wild spectrum of musicΓÇöthe Ethiopiques series, saxophonist Archie Shepp, film scorer Meredith Willson, and plenty more. That wide spectrum only befits JacklegΓÇÿs repeated need to buck genre; in fact, the 2005 version of the album hit the trash heap because ΓÇ£it sounded like any other indie rock-type band,ΓÇ¥ Flemmons admits. Co-produced by Stuart Sikes (Loretta Lynn, Cat Power, The Walkmen, Modest Mouse, The White Stripes) and the bandΓÇÖs Jason Reimer, Jackleg Devotional to the Heart sounds like exactly no one else.
