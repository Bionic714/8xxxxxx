,maddog7777,2013-06-03T13:27Z,"@nT8go7A- Thanks for the torrent, but in the future can you either post in brackets in the heading or even in the description if this is a [RIP] or full installer. I only ask because I generally look for the installer versions as RIPS are a lot of the times incomplete. Not all, but a lot can be. Just a mental note to save people from wasting time downloading.
