Bodmin Airfield was the development of a dream by local business man, Mike Robertson, to make aviation available to everyone. In pursuit of this dream, local engineers, The Dingle Brothers were commissioned to construct the airfield on what was once Treswithick Farm. In 1972, the airfield was bought by the Cornwall Flying Club, which, in turn, became a limited company, Cornwall Flying Club Ltd, in 1978. In keeping with the original ideals and dreams of its creator, Mike Robertson, Cornwall Flying Club Ltd. is quite unique in that it continues to operate as a non-profit organisation, to keep costs down to the end user and bring the joy of flying to as wide a range of people as possible.

Bodmin is a small airfield in the county of Cornwall. With two grass runways and nearly all runway approach paths obstructed by trees or bushes, the airfield is not easily accessible, piloting skills will really be tested.

Although the airfield is not licensed for night flying, day and night textures are included. Please be aware that only normal summer textures are included even though there won't be any problems using the airfield in any season.
