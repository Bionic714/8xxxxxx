I will tell you how I grew up and how I was trained, about the great sages with whom I lived and what they taught me, not through lectures and books but through experiences, writes Sri Swami Rama in the opening pages of this timeless saga.

These stories record his personal quest for truth and enlightenment. Inspiring, illuminating, entertaining, mystifying, and frequently droll humorous, they bring you face-to-face with the great Himalayan Masters, including: Mataji of Assam, a ninety-six-year-old lady sage who never slept Gudari Baba, who taught Swami Rama the value of direct experience Yogi Sri Aurobindo, who integrated meditation with action Uria Baba, who teaches that every human being has a potential for healing Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation.
