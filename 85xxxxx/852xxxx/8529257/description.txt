Information
------------------------------

Unreported World reports on the huge growth in cosmetic plastic surgery in Brazil.
Reporter Seyi Rhodes and producer Suemay Oram reveal that even poor women living in favelas can achieve the Brazilian body beautiful through subsidised or free cosmetic surgery provided by plastic surgeons who feel all Brazilians have a right to be beautiful, even on the country's Public Health Service.
In Brazil, plastic surgery for cosmetic reasons is not frowned on like it can be in the UK, and having a surgically enhanced body is sometimes seen as a status symbol. Plastic surgery procedures have gone up by 40% in two years and there are now 10 times more plastic surgeons in Brazil than in the UK. Brazil is second only to the USA in the number of plastic surgery operations carried out each year. Reasons for surgery vary: from wanting to have a body they feel comfortable with on the beach, to one that they feel will enhance their ability to get a job.
