All previous updates (1 and 3) are required for this release
to work. There is no changelog available for this update but
it was suposed to fix the teleporting aliens bug."
,Snowman2323,2013-06-01T19:03Z,"Uploader isn't lazy, uploader isn't even human. It's a bot that just uploads any new torrents."
,nignug,2013-06-02T01:20Z,Stifmeister is an android I believe. Not a robot.
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-06-02T02:14Z,"hehehe yea maybe maybe :P

And hey russianhornybear, maybe you should put your glasses on cause that text clearly is in the description. :)"
,Timbo6669,2013-06-02T04:02Z,To clear it up..Stify is a person who programs automated bots (software algorythyms) to upload instantly from I.P. addresses/Internet sites  of his choosing..Takes A LOT time out of searching for new stuff..Thanks mate for this..

,n0etics,2013-06-09T11:56Z,"Ok, so I  should finally say thank you, seeing as I keep downloading your torrents. Thanks, mysterious android/robot/programmer ...... thing...."
,Dodara,2013-06-10T02:27Z,"Mr. Stifmeister Sir, I've installed your blackbox repack release and updated it with the following:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8109360/XCOM_Enemy_Unknown_Patch_3_Incl_Slingshot_Pack_DLC-FLTDOX_
but when I use this update, the game won't start (crashes). Was I correct to use patch 3 before this?
Please help"
