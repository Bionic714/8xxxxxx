XCOM: Enemy Unknown will place you in control of a secret
paramilitary organization called XCOM. As the XCOM commander,
you will defend against a terrifying global alien invasion by
managing resources, advancing technologies, and overseeing
combat strategies and individual unit tactics.

The original XCOM is widely regarded as one of the best games
ever made and has now been re-imagined by the strategy experts
at Firaxis Games. XCOM: Enemy Unknown will expand on that
legacy with an entirely new invasion story, enemies and
technologies to fight aliens and defend Earth.

You will control the fate of the human race through researching
alien technologies, creating and managing a fully operational
base, planning combat missions and controlling soldier movement
in battle.
