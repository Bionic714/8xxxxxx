Amos Oz's first book, first published in 1965 and reissued in 2012, is a disturbing and moving collection of short stories about kibbutz life.

Each of the eight stories in this volume grips the reader from the first line. Each conveys the tension and intensity of feeling in the founding period of Israel, a brand-new state with an age-old history. Some are love stories, more are hate stories, and frequently the two urges intertwine.
