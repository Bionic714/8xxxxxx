Yeah Yeah Yeah - Yeah Yeah Yeahs

Yeah Yeah Yeahs (mislabeled as Master[1]) is the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' self-titled debut EP, released in 2001 by the band's own label, Shifty. It is sometimes incorrectly called Master due to the prominence of a necklace bearing that word on the album's cover. It reached #1 on the UK Indie Chart.[2]
Limited edition copies of Yeah Yeah Yeahs on 12" were made available for Record Store Day 2010 to commemorate the 10th Anniversary of Wichita Recordings.
The EP was named NME's second best single of 2002.
