Miss Blues - 2009 - Bad Prospects

For Dorothy Choncie Ellis, the road from Direct, Texas has been a long glorious trip. Orphaned at an early age, self determination and love for life and people has led her into many adventures of living. Think for a minute about the young girl from Direct, whose Mama carry instilled in her a love and respect for books and learning. From the cotton fields to servant quarters, Dorothy pursued education, earning a Master's Degree in Counseling Psychology from the University of Central Oklahoma. Her journey has brought her close to a Doctorate, but she has other passions as well. All along the way, Dorothy belted out Big-Time Blues, and self-published "For Blacks Only", a collection of memories in 1979. Dorothy became "Miss Blues" when "You is one black rat" was blaring on the wind up Victrola. She has performed with Richard "Groove" Holmes, Little Joe Blue, Drink Small and others; she opened for Bo Diddley, has appeared at many blues festivals including Arcadia Blues Festival, Pinedale Blues Festival, Southwest Blues Heritage Fest, Dusk til Dawn Blues Festival and more. Miss Blues, Dorothy Ellis, has the soul of the blues inside her. (cdbaby)
