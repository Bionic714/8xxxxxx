A newly formed "strings" trio (no drums) with 3 virtuosos from 1973



My favorite Oscar Peterson trio configuration is the early 1960's grouping

with drummer Ed Thigpen and Ray Brown but this one's in the running for

2nd place IMO.


Joe Pass comps brilliantly.......he doesn't step on the soloist's toes or 

confuse matters unless the music requires confusion
