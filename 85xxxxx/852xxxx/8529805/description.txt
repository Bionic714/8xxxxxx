A veteran of the Afghan war, a retired major, a hero of the Soviet Union, works as a stoker in a boiler room. He is an ethnic Yakut. He spends his life shovelling coal into the furnace and writing a book. Outside, it is the era of tempestuous changes in Russian society. The ubiquitous presence of organized crime even extends to his boiler room. Old veteran friends pay him visits, to burn something that seems to be human bodies, but the stoker doesn't seem to care. Producer's statement: "This was a very important time for Russia, an eventful one during which a new system was emerging. For a long time our society was frightened to discuss this period, but we are now able to think about it. From the filmmaker's perspective, it was like the Wild West, a source of creative energy".Aleksey Balabanov: Born in 1959 in Sverdlovsk.
