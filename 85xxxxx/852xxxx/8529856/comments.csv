,mlech,2013-06-04T15:52Z,"Works great, but are all old characters supposed to be erased by update?"
,mlech,2013-06-04T15:58Z,"I was able to fix the missing save files.  The game saves are located in /documents/neocoregames/van helsing/savegame

This version update looks for saves in a folder there named '0' .  The old version put them in a folder named '4919'  copy and paste all files from 4919 to folder 0 - -or just rename 4919 to 0.  Thanks!"

,Jagadance,2013-06-06T16:09Z,"I assume that this works fine with the reloaded version, and that you also don't need any previous updates before installing this one?"
,Jagadance,2013-06-06T16:10Z,"Oops, my bad. Just noticed the ""Includes all updated content so far"" part.."

After fully tested again & again for weeks.

This torrent isn't the full completed version include the update 1 to update 10(1.1.00), these torrent missing some of the effect & unknown.
eg, the BARRIER, enemy summon barrier contain sound only.
