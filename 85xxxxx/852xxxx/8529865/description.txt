Learn Chemical Reaction Engineering through Reasoning, Not Memorization
 
Essentials of Chemical Reaction Engineering is the complete, modern introduction to chemical reaction engineering for todayΓÇÖs undergraduate students. Starting from the strengths of his classic Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering, Fourth Edition, in this volume H. Scott Fogler added new material and distilled the essentials for undergraduate students.
 
FoglerΓÇÖs unique way of presenting the material helps students gain a deep, intuitive understanding of the fieldΓÇÖs essentials through reasoning, using a CRE algorithm, not memorization. He especially focuses on important new energy and safety issues, ranging from solar and biomass applications to the avoidance of runaway reactions.
 
Thoroughly classroom tested, this text reflects feedback from hundreds of students at the University of Michigan and other leading universities. It also provides new resources to help students discover how reactors behave in diverse situationsΓÇôincluding many realistic, interactive simulations on DVD-ROM.
 
New Coverage Includes
Greater emphasis on safety: following the recommendations of the
