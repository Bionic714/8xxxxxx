Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929) was one of the 20th century's most important Jewish theologians and philosophers.  He helped establish Das freie j√ºdische Lehrhaus (Free House of Jewish Learning) in Frankfurt-am-Main and collaborated with Martin Buber on a translation of the Torah from Hebrew to German.

The Star of Redemption, Rosenzweig's major work, was first published in 1921. Fusing philosophy and theology, the book assigns both Judaism and Christianity distinct but equally important roles in the spiritual structure of the world and finds in both biblical religions approaches to a comprehension of reality. 

The major themes and motifs of The Star -- the birth, life, death, and immortality of the soul; Eastern philosophies and Jewish mysticism; the relationship between God, world, and humanity over time; and revelation as the real biblical miracle of faith and path to redemption -- resonate meaningfully.

This new translation by Barbara E. Galli includes a Foreword by Michael Oppenheim and an Introduction by Elliot R. Wolfson.
