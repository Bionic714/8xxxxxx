,mouffette,2013-06-04T09:51Z,Great album but why rip an LP in 16khz the CD standard?  Assuming this is legitimately ripped from vinyl (usually you find Adobe Audition images and info on turntable and other tools used). Unfortunately this sounds no different than the 320mg on exystence.

1. Lurch
2. Su Su

If it's mp3's pulled from Amazon say so... and by the way the last track Lamont's Requiem is cut to 3:38.

Hope this helps someone."
,juju_hound,2013-06-05T02:37Z,"Hello Moufette, 

Let me address your inquiry. Check the links you posted again. There are 12 tracks.

I did this rip using a cheap DAC. I was testing my rebuild of the tube phono stage in my receiver, hence the 16 bit 48K. It wasn't intended to be the greatest rip ever.

It is interesting that the last song, Lamont's requiem is is short at 3:38. I have the green vinyl which I think was limited to the first 1000 copies. When looking at the last track, it appears that the deadwax covers half the track. It's translucent so I can see this. Perhaps it was a pressing defect, perhaps not, but it was ripped from the LP as is.

I don't upload much because there are others that can do it better. I just thought I'd share. It would be great if someone would post a better done rip.

No, it's not mp3's pulled from Amazon. 

Anyways, thanks for your feedback."
