,myd7,2013-06-03T08:27Z,"this is a different version that truHD release, you will see once you download! thank you for your interest in 3DBD25"
,antiEvo3d,2013-06-03T11:42Z,You are an idiot. Impossible to have exact same bitrates audio/subs.   This is why you are being banned everywhere!
,RonDaSupaTon,2013-06-04T23:28Z,"You know i'm a member of 3dbd25 for about 2 month's now and i love it .. even though what you say is true (what i honestly think is wrong since you are spamming on alot of his movies . i still like the site. Its an easy site where everything is just a click away.. he has a forum where he helps everyone , i had a problem with the activation (did not go through automaticly) i posted this on his topic and i was activated some hours laters PLUS they gave me a full day extra whilst i only lost like 3hours on my 2day's VIP ... For me , i put it this way : or i have to drive 10 miles and look on the street to find some bread for free.. or i go to the bakery behind my corner and buy it for 2 dollar .. why all the hastle ? if he asks money for his service, and the excact same service is provided somewhere else for free. those who want so search for it will use the free option.. but those who have not much knowledge from computers or internetting. Let them use a site who helps them.. i mean you are honestly only embarrasing yourself by spamming etc.. you just hate the staff so go spam everywhere? they should make the internet like 18+ Less whining and childisch behaviour .. its the internet, get over it. Thanks for the content 3dbd25 and all others who made the download scene for what it is today :)"
,antiEvo3d,2013-06-05T03:41Z,"That was lame. You use the same punctuation.  

You will continue to be spammed while you spam my torrents to promote your site."
,jctcom,2013-06-14T18:09Z,Sorry am I missing something?  Are you saying that we can download this file but it won't play until we pay this guy?  Some sort of unlock code?
,jctcom,2013-06-14T18:11Z,If that is the case.  Pirate bay please ban this guy.  This has to be considered illegal advertising / spamming on ThePirateBay.  and I see no indication in the description that we have to pay to be able to use this file.
