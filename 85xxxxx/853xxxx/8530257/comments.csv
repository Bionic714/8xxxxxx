Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

I die every time you walk away
Don't leave me alone with me
See, I'm afraid
Of the darkness and my demons
And the voices, sayin' nothing's gonna be okay,
I feel it in my heart, soul, mind that I'm losing
You, me, you're abusing
Every reason I have left to live.

Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

Lost trust, 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I've ever owned... gone
But I'm still breathing
Through the thunder, and the fire, and the madness
Just to let you shoot me down again
But I'm still breathing
I feel it in my veins, skin, bones that I'm losing
You, me, you're confusing
Every reason that I've left to live

Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under.

Chasing you but you don't look back
Words I threw that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you, no
Chasing you but you don't look back
Words I threw that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you

Don't bury me
Don't let me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under.

Oh, only you can send me under, yeah.
Under."
