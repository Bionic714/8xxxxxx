[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-02T01:56Z,that's about as golden as Golden Age can get buddy! thanks
,Mothra67,2013-06-02T02:36Z,"Thanks! I would put up the Lee Falk Phantom stuff, but some one did that a while ago and the ULs are still active so this and Flash Gordon are the next best thing!  Beside the Phantom Comics and strips come out to about 15 gigs of UL which is a little to much for me to handle right now!"
