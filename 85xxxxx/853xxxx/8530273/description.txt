Buck Rogers first appeared in the pulp magazine Amazing Stories in Aug 1928 (Armageddon - 2419 AD). The sequel (Airlords of the Hun) appeared in Amazing Stories in Mar 1929. Buck Rogers was referred to as Anthony Rogers in these stories. The stories were written by Philip Francis Nowlan.
Philip Nowlan and the syndicate John F. Dille Company (later known as the National Newspaper Syndicate), were contracted to adapt the story into a newspaper comic strip. Nowlan and Dille enlisted editorial cartoonist Dick Calkins as the illustrator. Nowlan adapted the first episode from Armageddon - 2419, A.D. and changed the hero's name from Anthony Rogers to Buck Rogers. The strip made its first newspaper appearance on January 7, 1929. Later adaptations of Buck Rogers included a serial film (starring Buster Crabbe), a radio series, two television series, and a movie.
