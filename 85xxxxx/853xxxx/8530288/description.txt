George Russell (1923-2009) pianist, composer, arranger, theorist



My description of this 1958 period piece: a JAZZ SUITE with NARRATION for 

               large ensemble.


If you liked Legrand Jazz...this is somewhat similar.  The narration is

"interesting."



Coltrane solos on track #1 only


Bill Evans has (4) solos
