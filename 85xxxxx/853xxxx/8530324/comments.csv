Thanks for quick upload, too bad speed is slow due to it just having been uploaded!

Thumbs up though! Shingeki no Kyojin "
,GenericUser9000,2013-06-02T07:37Z,Listed as having English subs but after the opening theme none were displayed
,Calim,2013-06-02T17:00Z,"@GenericUser9000; The subs were there for me at least!

In ten years of pirating I have never stayed up until the torrent was released, until now. This show is annoyingly good.
Thanks k1ng_ruLz!"
,terrencejsh,2013-06-02T22:34Z,This is an unexpectedly good show! I do not remember how I stumbled on it but I feel like I stumbled on anime gold. The descriptions of this show do it no justice.
,immortal2312,2013-06-04T16:22Z,I'm not getting any subs beyond the opening theme either
