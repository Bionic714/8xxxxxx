Mike Garson (b 1945-    )  most known for collaborations with David Bowie, is

not yer typical Rocker keyboardist.  This "High Definition" CD, recorded in an 

empty auditorium in Oxnard, California demonstrates audibly, Garson's amazing

depth and genre blurring chops.




PS...I need a hardware upgrade so that's all for now folks
