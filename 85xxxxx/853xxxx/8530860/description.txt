Movie Info

One young man's search for a missing family member leads him into a terrifying adventure in this thriller from Japan. Akira (Hideo Ishiguro) is a high school student who has fallen into a deep depression since his big brother Atsushi (Dai Watanabe) vanished under mysterious circumstances two years earlier. One day Akira is approached by a beautiful woman, Rei (Asami Mizukawa), who hands him something surprising -- Atsushi's identification card. Akira learns that Atsushi was abducted by a gang of vampires and has been spirited away to their secret island, and while he's been bravely fighting off his captors, he's been unable to escape. Akira joins forces with Rei and a handful of his friends, several of whom have remarkable fighting skills, to vanquish the vampires and bring Atsushi home. But this is more easily said than done, and Akira and his allies quickly learn that the leader of the vampire cult (Koji Yamanoto) is a fearsome adversary. Higanjima was directed by South Korean horror veteran Kim Tae-kyun and received its American premiere at the 2010 South By Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
