On the west coast of the US, this June playlist is on time. Those of you in other
parts of the world will think it is almost a day late. You would... be right
of course. Next month I will get it upped before it becomes the second of the
month all over the world. I swear.

This is a DOOZY of a month. Really great tracks.

follow me @indie69 , spread the word (not just about my playlist, but all of them)
and BUY music. If you like it of course.


I will see you in July.
