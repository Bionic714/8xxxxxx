,Kerosine_Monkey,2013-06-02T13:26Z,Something weird is going on with this torrent. It says no one is leaching it but according to piratebay 86 people are leaching it. Is it downloading for anyone?

Thanks anyway for your effort."
,llaney1,2013-06-03T09:54Z,Hasn't downloaded a bit for me either. Even when it showed it being seeded nothing was downloading.
,Hokka,2013-06-07T10:12Z,Anyone can download it? I get some 0.3 kb/s speed sometimes... By the end of the year maybe I can see it finishing
,muckymucks,2013-06-07T10:31Z,No seeds. What a pity.
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-06-11T08:08Z,I can't download any files either... :-(
,onslaught10989,2013-06-11T19:19Z,I can't download this. No seeders...
