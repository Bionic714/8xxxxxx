,Iceburgslim,2013-06-02T19:44Z,O cool. An animated rip off of warm bodies
,nothing37,2013-06-03T04:27Z,"Iceburgslim : Considering the story of this movie is based off of a comic book that was released by Dynamite Comics in 2007 and the fact that it has absolutely nothing in common with Warm Bodies story wise other than it having a Zombie in it, Maybe next time you can get your facts straight before you spout off nonsense about a topic you know nothing about. The Living Corpse makes Warm Bodies look like Sesame Street. Know your shit before you let it fall out of your mouth. "
,csnomis,2013-06-03T13:34Z,So its like Sesame Street with Zombies?  Because the first link kind of threw me.  Well Scene4All always does us right.
,KenCorpse,2013-06-05T15:53Z,"As the co creator of the comic book that this movie is based on, I hope that if you like the movie you'll go out and buy a copy to support us and make sure that more movies and comics are made!
And don't forget to check out The Living Corpse comic from Dynamite Entertainment!
Thanks!
