This is the soundtrack to "Zachariah," a film from the early 70s sometimes described as a "hippie western." The film is a whimsical retelling of Herman Hesse's "Siddhartha," but got poor reviews and flopped at the box office. The Firesign Theater were co-authors on the script but later disowned the film.

The soundtrack features the James Gang, Country Joe and the Fish, the New York Rock and Roll ensemble, Doug Kershaw, and White Lightenin' with incidental music by Jimmy Haskell. So far as I am aware, it was only released on LP and 8-track, not cassette or CD. The LP is a collector's item.

This torrent was made from a CD made from a cassette made from an LP on a low-end shelf system. The sound quality is listenable, but not great as the sound system's fidelity was mediocre at best. There are some pops and scratches as well as some tape hiss, and it seems to me that there's a slight high end cutoff on one or two tracks. 

The tracks are:

Main titles (Jimmy Haskell)
Lagune Salada (James Gang)
We're the Crackers (Country Joe and the Fish)
William Tell Overture (Jimmy Haskell
All I Need (Country Joe and the Fish)
Ballad of Job Cain (Doug Kershaw)
Country Fever (James Gang)
The Lonely Rider (Jimmy Haskell)
Medley-Camino, Used Wagon Salesman (Jimmy Haskell, Firesign Theater)
Camino Waltz (Jimmy Haskell)
Gravedigger (New York Rock and Roll Ensemble)
Shy Ann (White Lightenin')
Matthew (Jimmy Haskell)
End Titles (Jimmy Haskell)

This my first attempt at uploading a torrent. Be gentle!
