Sanjay and Craig - Season 1 - Episode 2 (WEBRip - 720p)
-------------------------------------------------------

This is the story of two inseparable best friends. Oh, yeah - one's a talking
snake. And Craig has a lot to say. He's always egging on and encouraging his
enthusiastic and overeager buddy, Sanjay, on epic misadventures through their
suburban neighborhood. Whether they're going undercover to defend their videogame
dominance at the Frycade or posing as doctors to conduct the world's first butt
transplant, they know that when they're together, nothing can stand in their way.
Except for their obsessive, snake-phobic neighbor, Noodman. Watch as Sanjay and
Craig dare to babysit bad-news baby, Richard Dickson! See what happens when Sanjay
loses his bathing suit at the lake! Witness the hilarity when Sanjay and Craig find
an old, abandoned robot! Get ready for 20 stories where routine hijinks cross right
over into the land of the hysterically absurd with Sanjay and Craig!
