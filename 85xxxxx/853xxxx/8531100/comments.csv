BUT , the software is legit. I am using it right now and I installed a new icon pack."

,Killher,2013-06-03T17:25Z,Because we were retarded enough to believe it had something to do with 8.1
,spykerman,2013-06-03T21:02Z,"so witch one is better know( Clean version with no key required to install plus activation on DVD)or
windows 8 evolution 2014 preactivated "
,Killher,2013-06-03T21:35Z,"If you're doing a fresh install, get this. It has all of the activators, so you can do it how you please. you can't update to this though. But honestly, 8.1 will come out on the 23rd, so I would just wait if it's not an emergency."
,Killher,2013-06-03T21:37Z,"Also, you can use windows usb/dvd download tool instead of diskpart to make the bootable key."
