Thanks mate!!!

If I EVER find the bloody English subs for this I'm REALLY looking forward to seeing it.

But for now you HAVE to be bloody FRENCH to view it  (coincidentally just like 'DEAD SHADOWS')

BUT...  at least with that one, it HAS been picked up by an American company that will distribute it..."
