Hey all! One of my all time favourite bands, Shapeshifter!

Bio: Shapeshifter are a live Drum & Bass act from New Zealand. They have been heralded as a musical phenomenon for their ground breaking live shows and unique blend of heavy soul with drum and bass


If I was going to ask you guys to buy anything it would be from this band, absolutely amazing sounds and composition + they are a small crew, not fucking Billionaires like the Stones or Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Have a taste, see what you think.
