Other notes:

The songs "All Around the World","Less than Perfect" and "This Boy Needs to Rock" are not included in the Expanded version of this soundtrack.

The audio fidelity of some of the tracks (particularly the ones only included in the expanded version) is lower than the rest. I'm not sure why this is. I read a few things about mastering issues on the original recording but I'm not sure.

The untitled tracks are presumably from a greater collection as they are not listed on the original album art.
