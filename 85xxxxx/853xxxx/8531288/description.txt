Due to the lack of availability of the original soundtrack cd anywhere on the internet, I ripped the game audio to FLAC and labelled the tracks to the best of my ability. These tracks are not the "full versions" of the tracks as heard on the soundtrack since this is just the music for gameplay (tracks seem to be shorter than the original versions but it's still badass). The album as seen here http://vgmdb.net/album/20911 is 54 minutes long, while this torrent is only 38. I would upload the official CD if i had it, but this is all we have unless someone comes forward with the original.

Yes I'm sure if you have your original copy of the game you could just play the CD audio on your Dreamcast, but if you don't want to do that, here's a torrent.
