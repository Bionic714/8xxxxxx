whats odd most of the ufo docus made were done in 2011 and 2012 and still no one has seen them LOL

alone heard of them.. 

why they should just make them free in xvid format and ask people to buy mp4/dvd format
to support them

or a t shirt or a $1 donation


that out there docu was made ages ago but looks like it could be a funny watch.. its more on conspiracies watching the promo

theres a few more ufo docus I couldnt even find a darn promo or trailer for!!!

such as craft of unknown origin

not sure if any been renamed though,


as the ebe awards said the truth is out there is called just OUT THERE :)"
[V],psspss,2013-06-02T09:31Z,"

I finally watch Solar Revolution.. although nothign about aliens or UFOs its about how magnet fields
influence us
and ESP effects being researched between humans and also humans to dogs etc

WELL worth a watch and download.. "
