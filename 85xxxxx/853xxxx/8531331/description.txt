The Ice Cream Girls is an ITV drama based on the novel by Dorothy Koomson. The story follows two vulnerable teenage girls, who in the summer of 1995 are accused of murdering a schoolteacher. For seventeen years, the two girls go their separate ways and lead very different lives. But now in 2013, they are forced to confront each other and their dark, shared history.
The series was shot in Bray, Co. Wicklow, Ireland which is used to resemble the town in the story in Brighton, England. Lorraine Burroughs (DCI Banks, Lip Service, Spooks) and Jodhi May (The Scapegoat, The Jury, Strike Back) play the lead roles of Serena Gorringe and Poppy Carlisle.
