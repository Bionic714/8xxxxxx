BTW could you upolad Serena's games whenever you could?"
,Penthesilea,2013-06-04T17:55Z,"Well, yeah - fortunately I do this for my own amusement, otherwise it would be a thankless task.  Anyway, Eurosport didn't show the Women's Doubles I wanted, so it's a win-win for you, no obscure doubles and Serena-Sveta from ITV instead (still not true HD sadly)...  turned out to be a good match. It will take a few hours for this to reach the seedbox after torrent is created so, have patience."
