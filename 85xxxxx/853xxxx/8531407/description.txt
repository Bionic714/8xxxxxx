The Complete Seven Soldiers of Victory by Grant Morrison is a new digital collection of the Grant Morrison epic maxiseries Seven Soldiers of Victory in one easy-to-read volume.

This is a completely new digital collection, and even though the resolution is not as high as some existing scans might be, the colors are more true.

Seven Soldiers: Shining Knight #1-4
Seven Soldiers: Zatanna #1-4
Seven Soldiers: Klarion The Witch Boy #1-4

...presented in the proper reading order.

Also included are several articles on the series - including a great Newsarama interview with Grant Morrison which is no longer available on their site - and some bonus artwork. 

This collection is along the same vein as The Complete Miracleman by Alan Moore and The Complete Marvelman in Warrior, which are also MiracleScans releases. All of these releases can be found on Pirate Bay under username "MrclScns".
