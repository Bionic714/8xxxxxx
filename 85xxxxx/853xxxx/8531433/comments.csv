There's also a Crossed - Badlands Annual 2013 that just came out I hope you included. And there's a one-shot 3D issue of Crossed as well."
,muckymucks,2013-06-02T12:39Z,Just checking your torrent....you have issue 22 of Crossed Badlands as a PDF. The CBR version came out for that.

Thanks :)
I'm going to upload a compiled torrent of Wish You Were Here next..."

Here's the Crossed 3D one-shot:
