,znavy264,2013-06-04T00:57Z,"As I figured, this is a direct rip of the Blue-Ray's files....there's no actual video file in it, just the file structure from the blue-ray itself.  Plz learn to rip."

Still amazes me that some people on these sites have no idea about high quality HD Rips.

If you have a clue and a quality HD Player it will Play BDMV folder structure rips just fine."
