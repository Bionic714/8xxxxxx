Mississippi Fred McDowell - 1969 - This Ain't No Rock N' Roll (1995)
Adding ten bonus tracks to the original release, 1995's This Ain't No Rock N' Roll is an impressive, extensive collection of the later work of Mississippi Fred McDowell. Though he uses a backup band consisting of second guitar, bass, and drums, the majority of the tracks simply feature McDowell unaccompanied, showing off his masterful bottleneck guitar skills. The material here documents a rather transitional period for the artist, as he was using electric instruments and expanding his repertoire to include some traditional songs which he was rediscovering. To be sure, a good deal of the material is of traditional origin, with "Levee Camp Blues," "When the Saints Go Marching In," and "Dankin's Farm." Covering over 75 minutes and 18 tracks, this is a pretty complete picture of where McDowell was in the late '60s. (AllMusic)
