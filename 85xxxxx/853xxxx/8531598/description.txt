Doctor Who 051 Spearhead from Space

The first serial of season 7 (1970), it is also the first serial to be filmed in colour and features the third Doctor, Jon Pertwee.

At the end of the previous season, the Doctor called on the Time Lords to send home a number of humans kidnapped from time, despite knowing that he is a criminal in the eyes of his people. For his interferences in time, he is punished with a forced regeneration and exile to Earth.

Companion-less and suffering amnesia, the Doctor encounters Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, whom he recognises from his adventures in "The Web of Fear" and "The Invasion" (serials 041 and 046). The Brigadier does not recognise the Doctor's new face, but does recognise the TARDIS.

However, the Doctor is not the only strange arrival on Earth at the time, a number of meteorites have landed in the country-side. Unable to recover more than a few fragments of the unusual objects, the Brigadier enlists the Doctor's help.
