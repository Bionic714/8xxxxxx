Recorded in Boston, mixed in Alabama and mastered in Nashville, the truth is bears the mark of its travels. ΓÇ£This album crosses a lot of borders,ΓÇ¥ Ferrick says. ΓÇ£ItΓÇÖs got a little bit of the Northeast, a bit of the South, and a bit of Nashville, too.ΓÇ¥ The album features the talents of Natalia Zukerman on vocals, lap steel and dobro, Matt Pynn (Lucinda Williams, Evan Dando) on pedal steel, Richard Gates (Richard Thompson, Suzanne Vega) on bass, Ro Rowan (Bob Forrest, Tiffany) on cello and both Steve Scully (Howie Day, Juliana Hatfield) and Dave Brophy (Will Daily, Patty Larkin) on drums. Boston-based collaborators Anne Heaton and Rose Polenzani show up to sing backing harmonies, and fellow Berklee College alum Paula Cole appears as guest vocalist with Ferrick on the albumΓÇÖs first song, ΓÇ£Wreck Me.ΓÇ¥
