A former Senior VP of Apple shares how Steve Jobs motivated people to do the best work of their lives
Jay Elliot was hired personally by Steve Jobs, just in time to accompany him on the last of his historic visits to Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, the visits that changed the course of computing. As Senior VP of Apple, Jay served as Steve's right-hand man and trouble-shooter, overseeing all corporate operations and business planning, as well as software development and HR. In Leading Apple with Steve Jobs, Jay details how Steve managed and motivated his peopleΓÇöand what every manager can learn from Jobs about motivating people to do the best work of their lives.
Steve Jobs used the phrase "Pirates! Not the Navy" as a rallying cryΓÇöa metaphor to "Think Different." In the days of developing the Macintosh, it became a four-word mission statement. It expresses the heart of Apple and Steve. The management principles that grew out of that statement form the backbone of this book.
