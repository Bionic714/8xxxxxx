Hello all! I ONLY upload torrents that are well organised and excellent quality. I'm sick of downloading bullshit, so I decided to do something about it.


Audio files are encoded in MAXIMUM QUALTIY VBR, LAME mp3 from FLAC files. Better than/just as good as CBR 320 with much smaller file sizes.
All tracks are named correctly and tagged with hi res album art (500x500) minimum. 

Enjoy! Don't be a douche bag, seed for others!


   
 !!!!Note!!!!: This is a repack of a CBR 320 discography I downloaded off of TPB.

             I only reorganised, added artwork and ripped the files from CBR 320                             
             to VBR.
             
             it still passes my certified skunky seal of approval :)
            
Also, my internet is powered by a small potato so the first few downloads WILL be slow. Please be patient!
