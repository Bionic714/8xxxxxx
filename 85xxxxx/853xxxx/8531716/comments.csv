[V],psspss,2013-06-03T04:50Z,"hes something else we knew would happen.. we knew the new format sucked and ratings would dropped

so the gadget show is back to old format! but seems they lost suzy from the team.. prob got sick of the producers messing her about and got another job else where no doubt..

===

The Gadget Show was originally a technology preview and review show presented by Jon Bentley, Jason Bradbury and Suzi Perry, but evolved over time to become a more challenge based review program.

For Series 17 the show title was changed to 'The Gadget Show: World Tour' , with only Jason Bradbury and Pollyanna Woodward as presenters.
Series 18 was renamed again, this time to 'The All New Gadget Show', still with Bradbury and Woodward as the only presenters.
Series 19 will revert back to the original title 'The Gadget Show', and sees the return of Jon Bentley and the addition of Countdown's Rachel Riley as presenters."
[V],psspss,2013-06-03T04:52Z,"opps heres not hes LOL and drop not not dropped

wish could edit comments here.. how come tpb havent improve the system for it be like this for years"
,SerSpec-V,2013-06-04T06:07Z,Well thanks for ruining Ancient Aliens for me (LOL). I won't bother to watch that anymore since they are lying about what's in the ancient texts or just basing everything on what Sitchin or Von Daniken says. I already knew the Hedges skull was not ancient. 
[V],psspss,2013-06-04T07:11Z,"it was good though wasnt it..

they really did debunk well and dug out the real facts and alternative explanations

but also pointed out the stones were just sand sand not very hard stone so copper-alloy tools could easy carve it.. sand stone oxidizes after 30 years and makes the surface harder and changes the colour to a reddy

i love how they pointed out a big forrest down the slope where they could get lumber from.. as well lol"
[V],psspss,2013-06-04T07:12Z,did anyone find the other files I commented in other ufo bundle. must be better copoes floating about somewhere
[V],psspss,2013-06-04T07:12Z,im mean were just sand stone
,SerSpec-V,2013-06-04T18:41Z,What it does prove is that ancient man was very smart when it came to Architecture and Engineering. Modern man/woman of today just sits in front of the TV drinks pop and eating chips while they watch Keeping up with the Kardashians. The question we may never know is WHY did they went to so much trouble to build these pyramids and other creative massive buildings.
[V],psspss,2013-06-05T04:24Z,"well egos mainly I say lol.. its like hollywood wants to control the web.. a king back in those days wanted big buildings and a coffin for himself

its like modern man just buys sports cars to show how big his dick is

but i think the great pyramid wasnt designed for a coffin as it lack decorations. it might of been some sort of healing room and later used for coffin

it could of been some sort of machine that produced electricity along the walls

but I still wondering if it produced hydrogen as vents went to outside and were blocked.. so the water under the pyramid would slow break out hyrogen from the electricity..

this would fit with gods from the sky... eqyptians in primitive airships

like most things back then the secret of it was passed on from people to people but not written down so when invaders came and killed the engineers the know how was lost

have a watch of revelations of the pyramids and also the 3 part pyramid code.. better then ancient aliens i think the truth is always somewhere in the middle"
[V],psspss,2013-06-06T08:11Z,"did you watch this in the 5gb ufo bundle

from Lisa (his wife)

We’ve received numerous requests for updates on where we are in the production of “extraordinary: the Stan Romanek story,” and although we’ve answered the question numerous times in comments on this website and via YouTube, we decided to do it one more time in a post.
We are in post-production, which requires video editing, sound editing, scoring and mastering, among many other elements. Another big part of the process is the development and execution of a distribution plan. We’ve had many people ask why we don’t distribute the film directly, and the answer is simple: Direct distribution reaches a specific target audience — people who already believe. In order to reach a larger audience — which has been our goal from the very beginning of this project — we are exploring several distribution options, including screeners and bringing the film to festivals.
In order to reach an audience of believers, fence-sitters and skeptics, we have to deliver a compelling story about people and their struggles to survive. That has been a goal from day one, too. If we created a documentary film highlighting only Stan’s evidence, it would not have been an accessible film. It would, more than likely, become a target for criticism and debunking. Instead, we’re telling a human story that is made more extraordinary by the element of Stan’s compelling experiences. We’re telling a story that believers and non-believers alike will connect with because everyone can relate to the human side of Stan and Lisa’s story.
Yes, the evidence will be there. But the emotion will be there, too. The challenges, the obstacles, the fear, the hanging-by-a-thread-to-get-by emotionally, spiritually and mentally will be present throughout.
Stan’s story is best told as a human story vs. a science fiction story. Doing so makes it accessible to larger audiences because the film is more appealing. The goal is to create awareness among the masses vs. preach to the choir. We want as many eyeballs as we can possibly get on this film. That’s how we can impact awareness.
As for dates and locations, we don’t have those finalized yet. When we do, we will post them here for everyone to see. Thanks for your patience and continue interest in this important project."

the points highlighted clearly show how lame they have become,

the plane is so obviously a fish.. it even has whirl patterns to show water flowing around the fins


and the crystal skills have been proven to be fakes on a few other docus as well. they showed a paper trail  and were made in europe by someone very skilled..
