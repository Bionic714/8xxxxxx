For more than two days, I've been stuck at 52%, along with dozens of others. If you're not going to seed a torrent to completion, don't bother to start it! PLEASE finish seeding this torrent."
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-06-06T21:13Z,Maybe the uploader has a problem? Click on jakuz. What I don't like to see is over a period of days he is starting new ones before the prior ones are complete. If one has a slow connection one should wait until one is finished before starting the next.

I did that before I posted my earlier comment, and what I saw didn't indicate he has any problem other than not seeding torrents to completion. Right now, I see that his last dozen torrents (going back a week!) haven't been seeded to completion. They show either 0 or 1 seeders, but typically 30 or 40 peers (77, in one case) waiting for the torrents to be seeded. That's just a ridiculous situation!"

Then quit creating new torrents! I see that you've started yet another new torrent today, while you've still got a dozen that haven't been seeded to completion. If there's something wrong with your PC that prevents you from seeding to completion, PLEASE don't start any more and make the situation that much worse!"
