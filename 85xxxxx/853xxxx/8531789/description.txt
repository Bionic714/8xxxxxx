The Voice: Series 2 - Knockout Round 1



Holly Willoughby and Reggie Yates present the first of two knockout rounds to be shown over the weekend, in which Jessie J, Tom Jones, Will.i.am and Danny O'Donoghue reduce their teams of seven down to the three acts that will perform in the live shows. The vocalists will be pitted against each other in further head-to-head battles, this time choosing their own songs, although they won't know who they're up against until the moment they're chosen to take the stage. Up for grabs is a place in Friday's quarter-finals.
