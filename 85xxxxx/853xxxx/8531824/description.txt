László Hortobágyi


 Multi-instrumentalist, keyboard player, sitar player and theorician of the musical language, László Hortobágyi made a name in sacred space music / ambient / world music territories thanks to the publication of a handful of releases deeply influenced by traditional hindu-Moslem music. In 1980 he established the musical society called Gáyan Uttejak Mandal. In 1984 he founded The Oriental Music Archives which explore the transcendent beauty of traditional music coming from the West and the East. His usual recordings deliver a ravishing mix between spherical electronic music for deep listening and the acoustic structure of ancient-world music. 
 
 László Hortobágyi is also a member of the Advisory Council of the Research Project of Computer Music at the Institute of Musicology, Hungarian Academy of Science.
