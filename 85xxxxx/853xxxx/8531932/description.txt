Plot Synopsis

In this scripted crime drama, Benjamin Lebel (Pierre Arditi) is an internationally reputed wine expert who uses his nose to unravel cases, initially for Police Inspector Barbaroux and later as an amateur sleuth. Lebel is a leading light in his field: an internationally reputed wine expert, who publishes a keenly-awaited new guide every year. So it's only natural that Barbaroux turns to him when he finds a dead body next to a glass of wine, alongside eleven other empty glasses. Aided by his assistant, young wine expert Silvere, and Mathilde, the head of his lab, Lebel joins in the hunt. In the heart of the Bordeaux vineyards, in the region of Cognac or in Champagne, Benjamin's expertise goes way beyond liquors and the finest wines. Having caught the investigative bug after his first foray into crime solving, Benjamin tackles cases like finding out who intentionally contaminated the vats at Chateau Erlange; who killed Baptiste Alulel, a highly gifted assembler of Cognac vintages; or who's prepared to kill to get their hands on a plot of miraculous land.
