This book starts with three assumptions:
1. You are using a feature-driven development iterative release approach to a project.
2. You can attach numeric business value to each of the features.
3. You can estimate the cost of developing the required software modules to implement the above features.

With these assumptions in place, the authors then use a number of net present value accounting algorithms to help you schedule the software module development to provide "Low-Risk High-Return development".
The algorithms are designed to maximise business return and minimise the risk as per the book's title.
