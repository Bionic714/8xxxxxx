Specifically, that means 13 out of the grand total of 16. Missing are "Dancers in the Dark" and "The Britlingens Go to Hell", which, to my knowledge, to date only appeared in anthologies which have not been (professionally) recorded, and "A Very Vampire Christmas", which to date only appeared in a magazine. It's a shame about "Dancers" and "Britlingens", which in my estimation are among the best of the stories, but short of an electronic (ick) or amateur reading there's nothing to be done about it. I was actually rather surprised I managed to track down every single one of the others - pleasantly so, of course!

eBook versions for all 16 shorts, in non-proprietary format (HTML), are included as well, to bring this as close to completeness as may be. :)

Thanks to the original uploaders of the various anthologies from which this torrent was compiled.
