Dont hate....You come here to insult for no reason...Your mother should have swallowed you. "
,NoN-D,2013-06-04T07:15Z,"Definition of a 'CAM' = Someone with a small, hand held camera walking into a cinema, sitting where they can get a damn seat and secretly filming a movie!!!! Its going to be far from perfect and is EXTREMELY risky to do... It WON'T focus very well, you WILL get background noises and low audio quality, and chances are they'll have to move it every now and then!

AS CAM'S GO, this ain't to bad... She's not an HD cam and it doesn't claim to be!! STOP COMPLAINING, BE GREATFUL AND APPRECIATE THE GOD DAMN EFFORT AND RISK THEY'VE TAKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AS CAM'S GO: A:7 V:7 

VERY watchable! I watch cam rips to see if its worth paying to go and see or not... You should do the same bitches! :D

Cheers for all the effort uploader! Much love!"
