PLOT
A high-adrenaline tale of young climber Peter Garrett
(Chris O'Donnell), who must launch a treacherous and
extraordinary rescue effort up K2, the world's second
highest peak. Confronting both his own limitations
and the awesome power of nature's uncontrollable
elements, Peter risks his life to save his sister

Paxton and Nicholas Lea) in a race against time. The
team is trapped in an icy grave at 26,000 feet - a
death zone above the vertical limit of endurance
where the human body cannot survive for long. Every
second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of
fellow climbers, including eccentric, reclusive
mountain man Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), to ascend
the chilling might of the world's most feared peak to
save her
