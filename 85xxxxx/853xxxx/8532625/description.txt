The Branded Mind is about how people think, and particularly how people think about brands. It explores what we know about the structure of the brain, explains how the different parts of the brain interact, and then demonstrates developments in neuroscience and neuromarketing, and how brain science can contribute to marketing and brand-building strategies.
