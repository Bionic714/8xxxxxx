Which version is this?"
,sertre,2013-06-02T21:09Z,This is version 9
,sertre,2013-06-02T22:41Z,"To bypass FSX Database error to use FSC on FS9.

Go to the folder where FSC 9 is installed and open the file named fsc.ini in Notepad.
Scroll down to the bottom and you'll see the following line.

FSX=-1

Change this to FSX=0

Save the file as is, then try running FSC 9 again.

It should run the FS9 database in FSC, "
