Plot

In the near future, Earth is devastated in an environmental cataclysm and global warming, and the human race is forced to relocate to another planet outside the Solar System, Nova Prime, abandoning the Earth forever and leaving it in its primal state.

1.000 years later, The Ranger Corps, a peacekeeping organization commanded by General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) supervises the exodus, and comes into conflict with the S'krell, alien creatures that intended to conquer Nova Prime. Their secret weapon are the Ursas, monsters that can "sense" fear, but Cypher learns how to "ghost" himself from the Ursas and leads the Ranger Corps into victory.

Meanwhile, Cypher's son, Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith), blames himself for the death of his sister, Senshi (ZoÃ« Kravitz), at the hands of an Ursa. Not wanting to fail his father again because of her death, Kitai trains hard to become a Ranger just like Cypher. His application for the Ranger Corps is rejected due to his recklessness, and Cypher views him as a disappointment. Kitai's mother, Faia (Sophie Okonedo), convinces Cypher to take Kitai on his last voyage before retirement.
