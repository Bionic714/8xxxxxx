,atilastheb,2013-06-02T20:06Z,"if i install windows 8 ,will i have the abillity to save my filles to ""windows old"" file in C like windows 7???  sorry for my english.."
,dhjohns,2013-06-02T20:24Z,"I believe it does.  I never upgraded, but installed to scratch, perhaps you should google this.  I am sure if you do an upgrade all of you files will be saved.  If it doesn't do applications it should give you a list of applications in a shortcut on your desktop that you need to re-install.  BTW, logging in with a Microsoft account poses no problem."
,atilastheb,2013-06-02T20:54Z,thank you very much!! 
,dhjohns,2013-06-02T20:56Z,"Here is a link to a nice pdf about how to use Windows 8!

,crazy3verone,2013-06-03T00:09Z,When I look whats in the files I only see the ISO where would happen to be the support/windows permanent activator or would you have to open the iso say with 7zip or DAEMON?
,dhjohns,2013-06-03T00:30Z,"You burn the iso to your DVD or other media so that you can install Windows 8.  Once you do that all of the folders and files can be readily accessed.  Of course, you can always open the iso file with whatever extraction program you have such as winrar or 7zip.  In Windows 8 you can do this natively without any third party software."
,dhjohns,2013-06-03T00:32Z,I put the activation files in the iso image so that when the DVD was created they could be easily run from the DVD.  It minimizes the chances of loss.
,TunaHead,2013-06-03T05:30Z,What version of Windows 8 is this?
,dhjohns,2013-06-03T05:57Z,Windows 8 Pro with Media Center  6.2.9200
,TunaHead,2013-06-03T06:47Z,"Thanks, dhjohns!"
,yku1,2013-06-03T14:44Z,i want the x86 version!
,dhjohns,2013-06-03T15:30Z,32 bit version now available here:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8536079
,fickit,2013-06-04T03:30Z,"Thanks for the torrent.
Works great on dell studio 1909."
,dhjohns,2013-06-04T05:43Z,"That's the beauty, no bullshit!"
,Xclibr57,2013-06-04T08:41Z,"I may be an idiot, but how exactly do you use the activator? I run as admin, then not sure where to go... clicked on ""Windows 8 Install/Uninstall"", then it asks for a y/n input in cmd. I press ""y"", it does something quickly, then goes back to main menu and nothing happens... No auto-reboot. Must I re-boot manually?"
,dhjohns,2013-06-04T10:46Z,"Am not sure, but try copying files to your desktop."
,Xclibr57,2013-06-04T18:18Z,"I did, but no success. just performed a clean install again... but I connect to the internet while activating? or wait till activating is done?"
,fickit,2013-06-04T22:48Z,See if its activated {system properties}
,dhjohns,2013-06-05T02:08Z,you can connect to internet.  I would run activation.  restart.  Run personalization fix.  Restart.  Open system and see if I am activated.
,9genesis9,2013-06-06T16:52Z,"please seed, thx"
,geoffp,2013-06-07T09:32Z,"Will it upgrade from Windows 7 32 bit, or is a case of a fresh start?"
,andymyris24,2013-06-07T10:25Z,Can you update and everything with this install?
,dhjohns,2013-06-08T06:55Z,"Yes, after running both activation and personalization fix as stated in description."
,dhjohns,2013-06-08T06:57Z,I do believe you can upgrade.
,dhjohns,2013-06-08T07:03Z,I am sorry to upgrade from Win 7 32 bit you will need to go to Win 8 32 bit.  To go to 64 bit you need clean install.
,vampola,2013-06-08T17:19Z,"I have the same problem as Xclibr57. When i tried activation, reboot, Personalisation, reboot, it still says windows isnt activated...any ideas?"
,vampola,2013-06-08T17:27Z,There was something on the microsoft webpage about this issue happening when i try to install windows 8 without having windows 7 installed first. Is this torrent for an upgrade from windows 7 or can i use it to install windows 8 as a whole new operating system on a blank drive (as I wanted to)?
,dhjohns,2013-06-08T18:21Z,"As Always I installed this OS onto a reformatted disk.  I never upgrade.  Ensure you run these files as an administrator.  I test all sorts of software, so I re-install from scratch every so often.  I have NEVER had a problem with activation, and I always do so with the internet connected, using my Microsoft account, and BEFORE I update.  This is just MY experience."
,Jasonhk,2013-06-08T20:43Z,"thank you very much for the link. I did had a clean install, but am confused don't know how to activate it please. First of all, how do I even log in as an administrator? Can you give me a link to the microsoft support site you meant. I guess I do a lot more better when given instructions in details please"
,dhjohns,2013-06-09T01:48Z,You right-click the mouse and choose run as administrator.  As far as creating a microsoft account you can access the instructions here:  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-how
