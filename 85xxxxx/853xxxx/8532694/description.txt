This copy of Windows 8 requires no CD key to install.  Burn iso image to disk and install normally.  After installation go to support/windows permanent activator folder on DVD.  Run activation as administrator.  Computer will reboot.  Run personalization fix as administrator.  Computer will reboot and be activated.  Update with all updates.  If computer becomes deactivated at any time repeat above steps.  Windows Media Center is included but may not appear on start screen.  You can add it by showing all apps.

This is a no brainer and works every time.  If you want x86 version leave a message.  Please seed as I will not do so forever.
