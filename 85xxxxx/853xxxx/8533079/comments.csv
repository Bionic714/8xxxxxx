,binderguy1,2013-06-02T20:57Z,"Thanks for the ul!

Just out of curiosity, whom were the other 2 favorite artists?"
,Calel1234,2013-06-02T21:15Z,Thanks for the upload. I'm a huge fan of Alex Ross.
,PM987,2013-06-02T22:09Z,Thank you very much for this!  You are the best.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-02T22:18Z,"you're all welcome. 

definitely george perez and the other one just depends what i've been reading. lately, john romita jr.

john byrne, phil jimenez, gary frank, andy wildman, mark bagley, darick robertson. cover artists such as brian bolland, glenn fabry too."
,Mothra67,2013-06-03T00:32Z,"George Perez is a Phenom!  I still gotta go with the classics though, Like Ditko, Kirby, Toth, Wood, Robinson, and even the early comic work of Frazetta!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-03T03:47Z,"those are good choices, most from before my reading years. i have such little exposure to toth, wood, and robinson for example ...  :-)"
,Kick-bak_AU,2013-06-03T04:44Z,Thank you so much for the Upload
,tpbbabu,2013-06-03T17:05Z,"Hi stf , can you upp some Batman graphic Novels and mini series ?? I mean , there are loads of em' in Joshua's batman a-z torrent , but when i tried to grab it , i got a poor speed of 0.3kbps :("
,Mothra67,2013-06-04T06:35Z,"If you haven't read any wally wood, I will UL his weird science stuff from EC which is some of his best work, and also his early Thunder Agents stuff, which was also good, as far as Ditko and Kirby goes, well, there is ample examples of their work here on TPB!  mostly posted by me!  lol"
,Mothra67,2013-06-04T06:36Z,"BTW: can you take a request?  I am trying to get the Prowler mimi that was released, it's posted here, but the UL is dead."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T12:01Z,"oh yeah Mothra67, i enjoy your torrents of classics. i've never loved the works of kirby and ditko like some do. i think it's just not the same as the enjoyment i feel for work published when i was between -- oh, let's say -- 8 and 16 years old.

i think for many of us, the creators we're exposed to during our formative years become our favorites for life."
,Torrenad000,2013-06-04T22:55Z,"Thanks for the upload, that's some dynamite artwork! Romita Jr. and Bagley are definitely two of my favorite artists, though the influence of Romita Sr. on alot of artists throughout the years can't be understated enough."
,Torrenad000,2013-06-04T23:11Z,Im Curious who is your favorite writer(s)?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-05T01:29Z,"JR Sr. is another great artist, and i left out neal adams.

my favorite writers would include kurt busiek, denny o'neil, warren ellis, simon furman, garth ennis, alan moore, brian k. vaughan, james robinson, j.m. dematteis, and depending on the characters, sometimes i'd add john byrne, erik larsen, tom defalco, chris claremont and keith giffen."
,Torrenad000,2013-06-06T22:38Z,"Thanks, yeah Claremont's original run on Uncanny is still my favorite, his later stuff was kind of lackluster though. Grant Morrison had an interesting run on X-Men, but not everybody would agree with me. I agree with everyone on that list, i would just add J. Michael Straczynski, and Brian Michael Bendis (yeah im a huge spidey fan!)"
,Torrenad000,2013-06-06T22:49Z,"Oh i gotta mention Larry Hama's run on Wolverine too, is still my favorite, especially when he teamed up with Andy Kuberts great artwork."
