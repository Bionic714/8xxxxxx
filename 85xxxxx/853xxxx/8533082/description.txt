Patrician IV is the sequel to the historical trading simulation and stra-

tegy series. You are a merchant in northern Europe in the late Middle Ages

when the Hanseatic League was flourishing. Your goal is to rise to the

most successful and influential member of the Hanse, ultimately being

elected Elderman, leader of the trading league. You start bargaining with

common goods, build up your own production and establish a merchant fleet.

Later on, you will gain more and more political influence and even found

new towns.
