Detroit-based emcees Mister and Blaksmith have symbiotically stitched together keen, canny rhymes that vary in shades, inflected their own personal influences, but wrapped and worn gracefully together upon the same quilt. The dynamic meshing of their respective styles is galvanized by their inventive live presentations ΓÇô conceptual, theatrical, almost performance art; altogether curious and highly engaging. Cathartic, rejuvenating, and a portrait of two lives, two separate trails of influence, two burgeoning writersΓÇÖ minds in the ever shifting hip-hop realm. Dense, agile wordplay atop strutting night-drive grooves and subtle flares of funk, soul & Motown.
