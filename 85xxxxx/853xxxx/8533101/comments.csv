,nmemphis,2013-06-03T00:49Z,"pharmakate, thank you for all of the Merton stuff specifically... and Catholic materials in general. 

You are posting some excellent works in excellent quality and it is deeply appreciated.

If you have access, a PDF of the 1966 Jerusalem Bible with your quality would be awesome.  Or teach me how to make a ""clearscan searchable pdf"" please!

Thanks and Peace. "
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-03T02:31Z,"@nmemphis - You're welcome!

As for JB, I don't have one, but I've been thinking about doing the New JB for awhile, since I have an extra copy.

I would encourage you to train yourself to make good scans. It takes a little practice, but isn't difficult. I've thought it might be helpful to write up my method and post it here as an instructional guide, so maybe I'll do that soon. The short version: Use a fast sheet-fed scanner (I use a Scansnap; it's excellent) -- this requires removing a book's spine. Scan at 300 dpi grayscale. Keep all the images in a single directory, and use them as a new project in Scan Tailor. This is freeware that's essential for producing good images to be assembled into a pdf. Allow Scan Tailor to automatically deskew and select content. Examine pages and adjust as necessary. Then manually set margins of 3 mm for all pages. Output should be black and white, 300 dpi. (Adjust as necessary to account for color images.) Use Acrobat to assemble output images into a pdf. Then apply clearscan, a tool in Acrobat: 150 dpi for leftover images is usually sufficient. I then manually adjust pagination and metadata, and add Contents to the bookmarks, all within Acrobat. 

Voila. You're finished!

PS I've started doing minor editing of cover images outside Scan Tailor, using Irfanview -- I resize them and sometimes clean them up if I can. But this is too complicated to explain here."
,Mertonoia,2013-06-03T03:48Z,What nmemphis said! You already know how I feel about you. If I commented on every book you've got me reading I'd make a nuisance of myself. 
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-03T04:14Z,"@mertonoia - Yeah, sure, I know that. I'm still a glutton for praise though! Feed me, feed me!"
,nmemphis,2013-06-04T05:21Z,"pharmakate,

Thanks for the insight.  I will look into whether I can make the above process happen with my resources.

I mentioned the JB because from what I can tell it is unavailable as an eBook (I prefer Kindle books for straight reading and also use an iPad for pdf files) so it seems that a pdf would be our only recourse for use on portable devices like the above.
Other Catholic books that fit in that category are the NJB that you already mentioned, The Liturgy of the Hours 4 Volume set (actually three different versions are available: a USA set, a new African set, and a 3 Volume UK set), Christian Prayer (the 1 Volume version), Shorter Christian Prayer, the CTS New Catholic Bible, 1963 version of the Grail Psalms, etc.---I am sure one could make a very long list of excellent titles that aren’t available as mobi or epub files (Catholic or not).

I wasn’t sure how you did your work but having to pull apart a book clearly means you need to own it to do the scan.  How to get you a copy of the JB…

FYI- thriftbooks.com many times has books for $4 (JB in paper) with free shipping (not sure if you are in the USA) 

Bless you and your efforts!

[T],pharmakate,2013-06-04T06:09Z,"@nmemphis - If you're just looking for the text of JB or NJB, I think one or both of them have been used in Bible software packages, and I may have seen them at some point in one of those Bible dump torrents that have a couple dozen different versions. But I can't put my hand on one now, so maybe I'm imagining things.

Any scan I might do would be of the complete study edition, since those notes will never transfer properly to epub or mobi formats, and thus a pdf would be the only possible digital format (apart from full software packages). So I'd need one of those old huge hardcovers of JB -- but you're right, they're cheap.

I'm not likely to scan any Office books unless the layout is very simple. Can you imagine trying to navigate around a pdf of the Lit. of the Hours? It's just not practical. And there are cheap and free apps out there for any platform that serve up the day's prayers simply and easily.

But believe me, I have plenty of other stuff to scan!"
,nmemphis,2013-06-04T06:43Z,"I have seen the NJB in eSword and some other Bible software like Bibleworks, but not the JB.  The NJB is also available as doc or rtf file in some of the dumps of Bibles one sees around but it looks to be nothing but the output from something like eSword.  Good to have the text but it is not ideal for serious consumption.  The JB is much harder to track down.

You are right about the LOTH. Too complicated.  Hadn’t really thought of that.  And it is quite expensive for tearing up to do a scan!  Maybe Shorter Christian Prayer in the skinny one volume…much easier to navigate.

You have eclectic taste for sure but it runs right along the lines of much of what I deeply enjoy so I look forward to your future uploads with great anticipation! :)

BTW, is it better for scanning to have the hardback over a paperback for something like the ‘66 JB Reader’s Edition?"
,Mertonoia,2013-06-04T11:58Z,@ pharmakate - With pleasure! I'm about to upload Merton's talks to his postulants at the abbey. As they're in audio form we can listen while at the same time making our way through your exciting selections.
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-05T06:44Z,"@nmemphis - For scanning, it won't matter whether you're using paperback or hardcover; it's the interior that counts. But a paperback would be easier to cut apart. If you're not going to take the book apart, I don't know, but maybe a paperback would lie flat more easily on a flatbed scanner.

If you ARE planning to scan something like this but haven't scanned other books, you might want to start with some smaller projects first. It'd be very frustrating to try to learn how to get the details right when every mistake means you'll have to redo 1000 pages!

And I'm glad you like the uploads. Thanks!

@Mertonoia - I'm glad to hear you have those recordings. I was wondering if you did ... but I don't really have the bandwidth to upload such large files myself without burdening my system for a long time."
