This MP3 is the entire "James Gang Rides Again" album because I was too lazy to edit it into individual tracks. The MP3 was made from a cassette made from an LP played on a low end shelf system with mediocre fidelity, so the sound quality will be somewhat compromised. Expect some scratches and pops, and some tape hiss as well.

This MP3 comes from my vast collection of cassettes made with LPs borrowed from the library and from friends and relatives.
