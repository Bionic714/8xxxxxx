,wikanx,2013-06-03T20:27Z,dtsm> Can you read? It says TS in the title...
,acsmith1972,2013-06-05T01:59Z,Is HDTS short for crap video?
,R3D3Y3R1K,2013-06-05T02:52Z,a/v anyone please..
,fart_toy,2013-06-09T16:47Z,"hdts is short for high definition telesync. which means it was a cam shot with an hd camcorder, and the audio is audio spliced in from a direct audio track, instead of recorded with a microphone. still a cam, but with better audio. Until a TC (telecine) copy comes out, or an r5/r6 release, this is likely the best you'll see until yify group gets their hands on an actual bluray and posts it."
