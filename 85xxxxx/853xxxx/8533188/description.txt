Being able to design simple programs is a new form of literacy. Understanding how programs work will help you understand phones, web sites, banking systems, games, movies, social networks and many other computational systems you interact with. Being able to design programs will support your work as a scientist, engineer, artist and many other professions: programming will allow you to organize, store, analyze and visualize information; create animations, music, and online communities; control devices in our environment; develop computational models and simulations; and much much more.
