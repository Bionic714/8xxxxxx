,super1313,2013-06-02T21:40Z,can you seed this and where can i find a lot of the new fixes for 3.41 cfw. got a lot of new games but need fixes
,dududus,2013-06-02T22:04Z,"super1313:

ebootleggerjoe and opoisso893 spend days trying to fix new games.. but most are simply unfixable for CFW 3.55, it's simply not possible anymore. there are some exceptions though, like this one.

i recommend updating to the latest rogero cfw, 95% of all your old games will work, the remaining 5% you can easily update or patch and they will work too. all save games and settings will continue to work also, it really is safe and simple... otherwise 90% of new games will be unplayable for you.

if you need any help just ask! "
,flaviud,2013-06-02T23:15Z,almost all the new games were fixed by opoisso893. you just don't put them here. there were only 2-3 exceptions. 
,dududus,2013-06-03T00:00Z,i didnt find them.. if you did why dont you upload them for the rest of the 3.55 luddites?
,super1313,2013-06-03T19:02Z,ok thanks i will think about it. i will prabaly hv questions
,flaviud,2013-06-03T19:16Z,"i don't know how to upload torrents, and i don't want to make a job which a i can't do right. but the fixes are on opoisoo893 thread. no offense was intended"
,dududus,2013-06-03T20:24Z,"no probs mate... me too
