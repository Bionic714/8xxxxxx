The Edgar-nominated author of Gun Monkeys is back with a thrill-a-minute suspense novel that mixes crime and academiaΓÇöwith hilarious results. Here Victor Gischler draws us into a wild and wicked world, where tenured professors are busy burying bodies, cash-up-front P.I.ΓÇÖs hunt for missing coeds and one desperate street-tough has to decide which heΓÇÖd rather be: a live poet or a dead criminal.
Unabridged.
Read by Evan Greenberg.
