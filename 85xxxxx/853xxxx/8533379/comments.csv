,filthy3825,2013-06-02T23:35Z,"thank you. welcome back.
@eatvulva it should be the responsibility of downloaders to keep torrents alive as well. steelerj17 does his part to upload and seed until there are seeders. he/she cannot be solely be responsible for seeding. it is the LEECHERS."
,luckie7,2013-06-02T23:58Z,"Seriously you should upload something before you
start chastising others work. "
,eatvulva,2013-06-03T02:33Z,"@filthy3825 yes its up to downloaders to continue seeding, pretty hard though when steelerj17 doesnt let them complete and abandons them when they are within an ass hair of completion.
isn't the first time he's done this
@luckie7 lol, chastising, i just point out what is common torrent courtesy, :ps: practice what you preach dude."
,filthy3825,2013-06-08T05:41Z,would someone please seed. i am stuck at 99.7%
