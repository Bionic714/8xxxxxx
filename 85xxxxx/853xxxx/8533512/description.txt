"Exotic Birds and Fruit," Procol Harum.

These MP3s were ripped from a cassette made from an LP played on a low-end shelf system. Expect mediocre sound quality, some surface noise, and some tape hiss.

The tracks are:

Nothing but the Truth
Beyond the Pale
As Strong as Samson
The Idol
Thin End of the Wedge
Monsieur R. Monde
Fresh Fruit
Butterfly Boys
New Lamps for Old

This is yet another tape from my epic collection of cassettes made with LPs borrowed from the public library, friends and relatives.
