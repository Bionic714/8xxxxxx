,local420,2013-06-03T16:02Z,is that all the store content sims 3 has come out?
,NeonYouki,2013-06-03T21:27Z,"@local420 - I grabbed a recent store content about a month before posting this.  I think EA released new store content each month, so if you think it's worth it, you can find other store content to add on."
,catd323,2013-06-04T03:06Z,:) Thank you. Grabbing now. Hopefully it will work for me
,mesavage,2013-06-06T08:44Z,Oh please let this one finish ;-)
,NeonYouki,2013-06-07T06:21Z,"Sorry about the delay.  I'm going to keep seeding very soon.  I installed a program that required me to move my files to a different location and I didn't expect that I'd have to stop seeding for so long.  I'll be seeding again in about an hour or so.

Again, sorry for the delay.  I know how bad it sucks to have to be stuck and waiting especially on large downloads where you've already downloaded some of it."
,NeonYouki,2013-06-07T10:10Z,Sorry for the delay.  Seeding has resumed.
,IcedFog,2013-06-09T09:48Z,"Hi there :)

I really appreciate you uploading this. I wanted to buy all the Sims stuff, but my budget doesn't really allow it, and it seems like the prices are really exorbitant. Then again, everything seems to be, but that's another topic. 

I have one question though. I have the base game and two expansion packs on disk. If I install my Sims 3 disk and expansions, can I use the ones from this torrent with them, or would that screw something up?

I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, but I just really want to know to be on the safe side.

,NeonYouki,2013-06-09T12:00Z,@IcedFog - I'd imagine that as long as you install them in the proper order as shown in the installation instructions in this torrent (same order they were deployed by EA) then you should be fine.  You'll still need the crack for it all to work I'd imagine.  Be sure to block the registration through EA when you do this.  You can use the keys in this torrent to make sure you aren't somehow connected with the ones you bought.
,IcedFog,2013-06-10T22:32Z,"@NeonYouki

Ah, I see now. Thanks for clarifying :)"
,NeonYouki,2013-06-13T07:19Z,"10GB left for me to seed and it will all be available for everyone.  If anyone is stuck at a certain percent up to the end of the month, post a message here letting me know what percent you're stuck at and I'll seed a little while longer.  There are 116 people who are trying to download this as of right now and I'd imagine there should be a fair number of seeders in the bunch once they get it all."
,marherx,2013-06-13T16:41Z,Does this work on mac? :) tnx
,NeonYouki,2013-06-13T23:36Z,"@marherx - If all Sims 3 games run on both Mac and PC, then probably, but I wouldn't take the time to download it all to find out."
,bixtel,2013-06-14T12:17Z,The key for the installation don't work. I'm trying to install the core game under Disk and it's asking me for a shorter keycode than the one you provided in your installation document.
,iBunzxc,2013-06-15T14:03Z,Is it me or what? I'm doing like 10 minutes for 0.1%?
