I collected all of the expansions and store content from various sources.  (See below)  I've also included nude packs and made sure that the University schedule bug was fixed before releasing this for everything.  (The bug was where the class schedule was empty and it was caused by a couple store fixes.  I placed the broken "fixes" in a separate directory so that they don't fix your game to a non-working state.)

I also made a nude clothing package that works for everyone and for every clothing option.  Plus, I made sure that all installation content is in ISO format and numbered in the series you need to install it in.  The instructions I wrote will give you a detailed walk through of installing your game so that everything works correctly.
