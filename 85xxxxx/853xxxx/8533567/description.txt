The hit HISTORY series returns to the only family-run pawn shop in Las Vegas, where three generations of men carefully assess the value of items brought in by an array of quirky customers in need of fast cash.

Long before banks, ATMs, and check-cashing services, pawnbrokers provided monetary loans in exchange for personal items of value, and are still helping people make ends meet today while bringing in a sizable profit for themselves. Watch in PAWN STARS as the Harrison family attempts to find the gems and bust the fakes, all in hopes of making the biggest profit possible. Grandfather, father and son use their sharp-eyed skills to assess the value of items ranging from the obscure to the historic. There isn't much the Harrison family hasn't seen or heard, making Richard, Rick and Corey experts in rare collectables and negotiating.

Each episode of PAWN STARS features an array of characters attempting to sell, purchase or pawn items that the Harrisons must carefully appraise, and determine if they re real or fake before revealing the often surprising answer to 'What['s it worth?'
