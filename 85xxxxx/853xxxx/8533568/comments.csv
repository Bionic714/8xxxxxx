,Soulketcher,2013-06-03T16:14Z,"@Sasnet22 - I logged in just to say..

WATCH YOUR DAMN MOUTH/COMMENTS..

You totally jumped down this UP'lers throat without any hesitation or thought to check exactly what it is you are attempting to dis-credit.

I think you  need to check yourself, your rudeness, ignorance and trivial name calling is NOT welcome here .. If I was a MOD I would ban your @$$ - 

@ the crew of ""The Rain"" thanks for all your hard work, I have used many of your releases and they are akin more to art and even approaching perfection. 

We ""power-users"" consistently use a certain set of core-apps and settings on any windows install, and you guys are fantastic about including those very apps, installed , regged & tweaked and that saves time and time is money. 

 If that wasn't enough, you all understand how incredibly ""geeky"" we get about the way the themes/shell tweaks/replacements truly make using that OS Install a one of a kind ""art-like"" nirvana reaching experience .. 

I am proud to be a ""Rain Fan-Boy"" and I will gladly provide the thunder and shove a lightning bolt up the arse of the haters that spew stupidity without first checking the basics that ANY torrent has to offer.

Thanks again, and forget the haters .. your work is better than anything they could achieve in a lifetime."

,mas2ery,2013-06-04T12:06Z,"hey brain, I use similar configurations and tweaks which is always a pain when doing clean install. which files can i mod in your iso just to remove uxtheme and alienware visual styles? I prefer classic theme and darken colors manually. or i can possibly remove theme after install? of course. ty for your distro "
,mas2ery,2013-06-04T12:08Z,"but i disable mouse enhancement and set to 6 in reg for 1:1 in wot

[T],prodallasosoft,2013-06-04T12:47Z,"OnlyByTheRain, I am gonna take a shot here by DLDing your app. I like the screen shots and appreciate your your trouble and up. Please keep seeding as the torrent is very slow."

,DaMoose74,2013-06-11T09:48Z,Looks interesting. I'm a fan of finished looking custom mods. Like Soulketcher I am also a fan of pre-installed 'core' software and reg tweaks. Hope its as good as I think it'll be. Thanx for the up OBTR!
