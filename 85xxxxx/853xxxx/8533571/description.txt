This LP was originally released by the MGM label in the late 60s and re-released on cassette (and LP too, if I recall correctly) by Polydor in the 80s. All these tracks were recorded and mixed for mono, and there were never any true stereo versions.

These MP3s were ripped from the Polydor cassette played on a low end shelf system. Expect mediocre sound quality and some tape hiss.

The tracks are:

When I Was Young
A Girl Called Sandoz
Don't Bring Me Down
She'll Return It
See See Rider
The Other Side of This Life
Hey Gyp
Help Me, Girl
That Ain't Where It's At
You're On My Mind
Inside Looking Out
Cheating
