A strange recurring dream haunts Ethan Wate( Alden Ehrenreich) in his sleep, but he prefers anything to his waking life. Trapped in a small, conservative Southern town with his withdrawn father, Ethan desperately wants to escape. Then the beautiful Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) arrives at his school, and mysterious events begin to occur. Lena has a secret: she is a Caster with powers beyond her control. Worse, when she reaches her 16th birthday, she will be claimed by either the Light or the Dark... and there is no escaping her fate in this supernatural love story based on the best-selling book series.
