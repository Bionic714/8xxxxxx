Version 1.03 (from OS X 10.6 Intel).

With 10.7 Apple omitted this from the distribution with the result that Logitech G25, G27 users can no longer enjoy force feedback. 

Retrofitting this kext re-enables FFB with some games (DIRT2, F1 2013, GRID,‚Ä¶). 
If you know how to install a kext, just o it otherwise use a kext installer like Kext drop: http://www.cindori.se/en#2

HOWTO:
Install the kext, reboot without connecting the wheel.
After booting into Finder, connect the wheel.
Run the game. Feral's ports simply select control options and teach the controls to the games. 
Hint: In order to enable all wheel functions, please also check out Feral's FreeTheWheel http://support.feralinteractive.com/files/freethewheel/FreeTheWheel.dmg

Kudos to the people at siniscope.com for figuring this out. Check out their game!
