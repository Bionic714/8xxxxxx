Just a question though: do you plan on re-upping some of the movies you first posted that were never seeded through? There were a couple I was interested in especially ""the prisoner"" which is a rarity and impossible to find in my country."
,4gringo,2013-06-03T13:03Z,@SteelerJ17 NOBODY IS SEEDING INCLUDING YOURSELF??? PLEASE SEED PEOPLE!!! :-)
,E.Game,2013-06-03T21:44Z,welcome back SteelerJ17... :)
,johnnyvelazquez,2013-06-04T03:40Z,"Please, someone seeeeeeeeeeeeed!!!!!"
,4gringo,2013-06-05T02:42Z,SteelerJ17. Claims to seed for a week which is a total lie! I not bothering with SteelerJ17 torrents anymore! I stick with yerisan710 at least they are reliable.

,LouisAnderson,2013-06-07T14:25Z,"Trying to be fair, at the beginning SteelerJ17´s torrents worked just fine. And I (we) had time to make this work for everybody. It was a great, if short, time with reat titles.

But in recent weeks I too could´t finish some torrents, including THE PRISONER, which was one of my requests. I just stop, even though I want some of this movies really hard.

I just think it became too much to handle. But let´s not rush to conclusions and bite the hand that feeds. We don´t know what´s going on with SteelerJ17 on his life outside this and I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt for now."

,famemon78,2013-06-07T16:59Z,hm u make a valid point Louis Anderson .. well lets hope for all our sakes whatever if any issues there are he gets em sorted :)
,johnnyvelazquez,2013-06-07T23:35Z,Yerisan is much better with his torrents. Steeler doesn't stick around to finish. He should be BANNED from TPB.
