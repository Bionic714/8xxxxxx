~~~PENDULUM SONGS~~~

Hello every1!
This torrent includes most (if not all) of the Australian band's known as "Pendulum" songs.
If you're not familiar with the band I strongly suggest to take time to listen to as many of the tracks as possible, as they expiriment with many music genres. Therefore, you may love The Island (most people do) but hate Voyager.
If you're a D&B fan, note that the main D&B songs are in the early ones, meaning Hold Your Colour and some singles.
Here is a full list of the songs I have encluded in this torrent.
