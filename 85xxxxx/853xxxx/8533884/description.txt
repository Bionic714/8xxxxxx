These MP3's were ripped from a pre-recorded cassette played on a low end shelf system. It's listenable, but expect mediocre sound and some tape hiss.

As an extra added attraction, I've added the Animals' live version of "Paint It Black" ripped from the VHS tape of "Monterey Pop."

The tracks are:

River Deep, Mountain High
San Franciscan Nights
Year of the Guru
Anything
Monterey
White Houses
Winds of Change
To Love Somebody
Sky Pilot
Paint It Black (from the VHS tape of "Monterey Pop."

Another tape from my 600+ tape collection, about a third pre-recorded, the rest made from LPs borrowed from the public library, friends and relatives. "Why cassettes?" I hear you cry. Well, I'm just an analog guy in a digital world.
