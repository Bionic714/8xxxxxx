===================== NOTE =====================

If any of MY torrents get NO or only a few Comments

Then I take this as:

You never liked the series
You never liked the quality
You are ALL very ill-mannered


It does no matter which one of the above, but

I will not post any more in that series or maybe even on that topic
I will not re-seed it


I never reseed for downloaders I do not know
If you've never posted a comment on my torrents I do not know you
Do not ask for a re-seed you will be ignored


===================== What's In This Torrent =====================

Professor Alice Roberts journeys 40,000 years back in time on the trail of the great beasts of the Ice Age. Drawing on the latest scientific detective work and a dash of graphic wizardry, Alice brings the Ice Age giants back to life.

The Ice Age odyssey begins in the 'land of the sabre-tooth' - North America, a continent that was half covered by ice that was up to two miles thick. Yet this frozen land also boasts the most impressive cast of Ice Age giants in the world.

High in a cave in the Grand Canyon, Alice discovers the mummified poo of the loveable, grizzly bear-sized Shasta ground sloth. Lying in the sands of Arizona are the shelled remains of a glyptodon, surely the weirdest mammal that ever lived. On the coastal plains of California, Alice encounters the vast Columbian mammoth, an animal far larger than any elephant today.

These leviathans all have one thing in common: they were stalked by the meanest big cat that ever prowled the Earth, armed with seven-inch teeth and hunting in packs - Smilodon fatalis, the sabre-toothed cat.
