*** Upon attending this show at the Attic, "G-Vegas" as it's known, someone ended up making over 100 conterfeit tickets for this show.  The show was already sold out.  At its BEST, the venue only held 700. When you add another 100+ people, it made it unbearable.  This was one of those shows where you were shoulder to shoulder.  I could LITERALLY pick my feet off the ground.  

Everyone was covered in sweat due to all the body heat and the venue's air conditioning couln't compensate for it.  I was about 10 feet from the stage.  The band was dripping with sweat...JB had sweat dripping off his nose (that's how hot it was).  He kept leaning towards the crowd during this show with this "evil" grin.  I don't know how in the hell they played so long.  They HAD to be on something to be able to do it.

It was pretty easy for me since I had 2 tabs of "OHM" doses in me.  If anyone had those in 1993 during summer tour (RFK Stadium in my case), you will recall they were white with red lettering and they were as thick as cardboard.  Taking 1/2 of one would do the trick for casual users.

One nice thing about the crowd is that everyone around me that were all sandwiched up together were hot college chicks.  

After the show, my friends and I hopped on our Cannondales and Treks to go riding around the campus.  

This show sticks in my head very vividly.  That was pretty typical when I dosed for some reason. ***
