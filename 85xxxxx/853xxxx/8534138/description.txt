From the same producers who created the incredible 'Deepest India' collection (Paul Hodson and Hardeep Saini), this is 

a hot and spicy selection of Bhangra rhythms, instruments and vocals, hits and phrases. The emphasis is on rhythm and 

percussion, presented as sampled loops. The Dhol, Dholok, Ghara and Tabla, amongst many others are included, as well as 

some enlightening vocal extracts. The samples are grouped into homogenous "kits" of similar sounds and tempos
