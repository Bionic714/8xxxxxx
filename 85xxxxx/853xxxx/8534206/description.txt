The last two splits were excluded because I'm keeping them in my V/A directory.

Most of the files in this torrent are mp3@320kb/s (with the exception of a few .m4a files), and the vast majority of them were obtained from bandcamp. If you'd like to support an awesome label and even more awesome bands, you can do so here:

I expect downloads to be slow initially, but I ask that everyone seed as soon as your downloads are finished. Though you could get most of these files from the EEE Recordings bandcamp page, many of these albums were obtained from a series of four discography compilations, so I figured I'd save you all the trouble of sorting/tagging them.

(Note: The files still retain their original filenames from the discography compilations. Though I could have used a script to automatically rename them based on their id3 tags, I didn't want to risk losing files. The tags are correct despite this)
