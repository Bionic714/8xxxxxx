These MP3s were ripped from a pre-recorded cassette played on a low end shelf system. They are listenable, but expect mediocre sound quality and some tape hiss.

The tracks are:

Sunday Morning Sunshine
Sniper
And the Baby Never Cries
Burning Herself
Barefoot Boy
Better Place to Be
Circle
Woman Child
Winter Song

Yet another tape from my 600+ collection about a third of which are pre-recorded while the rest were made from LPs borrowed from the public library and from family and friends. "Why? WHY?" you stammer, shocked and mystified beyond comprehension, horrified that anyone would be so stubborn about refusing to embrace the digital age. Well, here's the reason. I'm cheap, that's why. Replacing even half those tapes with CDs would cost around three grand. Ya gotta problem with that? You do? Yeah, well, if you weren't at least as cheap as I am, you wouldn't be looking for free downloads like this in the first place, suckah!
