Source: Video.: TS Greatness - thx

Notes: first off sorry, didnt know yesterday that there was internal better
source around, hidden from us. this new one is a lot better, no flickering, no
focus problems, no movement at all. too bad its not sharper than the russian
release, otherwise great.

ENCODE
fixed colours and adjusted brightness and contrast as needed.
found the 1min25 bonus scene on the net and appended it on the new video.
so its complete now, you should really see this :=))
For the audio i took Milleniums Line, was already lipsync, only problem was
a background noise, that was very disturbing, so i cleaned it very nicely,
sounds perfect now.
this is my final version and will do me now til R1/2/4/5/6 comes out
enjoy
