I found as many books as I could, but this collection is by no means complete.  This guy is next in the Project Superpowers collection I am compiling:

After his parents were killed in an airplane accident, Allen Turner was raised by his scientist uncle to become "outstanding in mind and body." A brilliant scientist, he had no super powers but did have a boomerang-shaped airplane dubbed The Wing

that flew by the power of Earth's magnetic poles. He worked out of a hidden hangar/laboratory dubbed The Skydrome. With this and the money he inherited from his late uncle's will, he fought crime. Skyman carried two pistols; an Atomatic and a Stasimatic. He was in a steady relationship with Fawn Carroll, who loved both Allen and Skyman.
