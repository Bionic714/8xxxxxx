Viz UK - June 2013

Viz is a popular British comic magazine 
which has been running since 1979.
The comic's style parodies British comics of the post-war 
period, notably The Beano and The Dandy, but with incongruous 
language, crude toilet humour, black comedy, surreal humour 
and either sexual or violent storylines. It also sends up 
tabloid newspapers, with mockeries of articles and letters pages. 
It features competitions and advertisements for overpriced 
'limited edition' tat, such as a cat which "shits its own weight 
in gold", as well as obsessions with half-forgotten celebrities 
from the 1970s and 1980s such as Shakin' Stevens and Rodney Bewes. 
Occasionally, it satirises current events and politicians, but has 
no particular political standpoint. Its success has led to 
the appearance of numerous rivals crudely copying the format 
Viz pioneered; none of them has managed seriously to challenge 
its popularity. It once enjoyed being the third most popular 
magazine in the UK,
