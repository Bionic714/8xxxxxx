From the Infowars web site :: On the Sunday, June 2 edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex takes a look back at some of his recent best episodes before embarking for Watford, England to report on the secretive Bilderberg group's 2013 meeting. We'll review Bill O'Reilly's subliminal propaganda piece, subtly demonizing Alex Jones as "hate speech." We'll also hear from two of the most bold citizen journalists and activists of our time: author and social analyst Mark Dice, whose videos have exposed America's zombie-like mental state, and We Are Change reporter Luke Rudkowski, who recently confronted globalist minion Henry Kissinger. Joel Skousen, author of The Secure Home and Strategic Relocation, consultant and editor of World Affairs Brief also gives key analysis of Benghazi-gate and the IRS scandal.

This pre-recorded broadcast consists largely of previously aired material.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
