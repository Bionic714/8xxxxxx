[T],Magash,2013-06-06T00:05Z,Hey Gary whats up. I'm still in California hiding the fact that I watch this shit knowing full well that if my friends find out their gonna beat my ass for my own good.
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-06-06T02:35Z,"Good to hear you're still alive mate! You know, I tried watching an episode of TOWIE from the start and one of the more recent ones and it did nothing for me. I enjoy it when it is broken down for 8 out of 10 Cats's jokes!!"
,iryhousen,2013-06-07T02:34Z,"One of the bits they showed on 8 out of 10 was from the season 5 finale, Gary, in case you need to see more of Gemma in her swimsuit."
