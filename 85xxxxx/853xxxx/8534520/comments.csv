,dac13,2013-06-03T18:45Z,"@sk8chalif WTF? If you're not seeding something your are downloading, it can slow your download speed for that download. The client sees you as an unhealthy part of the swarm... so, correct if I'm wrong but as I can see, you want to speed up YOUR download speed by slowing others, right? "
,dac13,2013-06-03T18:46Z,btw thanks!
