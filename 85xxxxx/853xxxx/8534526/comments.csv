,mikem777,2013-06-05T08:13Z,Basically wikipedia is a huge accumulation of mainstream lies for the stupid sheeple. The elite knows this stuff to be real but the sheeple are not meant to believe it. Just do the experiments to verify his claims or study physics. There are disinformation agents out there trying to attack and debunk anything that may shatter the collective hypnosis of mainstream education. Bear in mind that both Max Planck and Albert Einstein were massively attacked in the beginning for their unconventional ideas. Meyl is for real and he's a true idealist.
