The Knockouts Round 2

Holly Willoughby and Reggie Yates present the second of the knockout rounds. The coaches must reduce their teams of seven down to the top three, who will then progress to the live shows.

Sir Tom, will.i.am, Jessie and Danny pit their seven remaining artists against each other for one final battle in the knockouts to compete for the final three places on their respective teams.

It is now the artists who take control - they must each choose just one 'killer song' that they think will give them the very best chance to impress their coach.
In a further twist, the artists do not know who they are up against until the moment they are chosen to take the stage.

Tension and adrenaline run high as the artists all battle it out to make it through to the live quarter-finals and win one of the three coveted places on their team.
