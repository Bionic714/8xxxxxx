,bignowhere,2013-06-03T08:01Z,"Why even bother listening to comedians like rylemdr (pronounced rimlicker in it's native language).  He's taking the piss and getting great whoops of joy when you scream and curse at him.

Although saying that, shungbat69 is funny. To quote: ""Joffrey shits on Sansa's head, the end. Then he kills some more hookers with his crossbow."" end quote.

Nice one.

You are quite correct, there should be music during the credits. It is different music for every episode, so it should be included, especially since the credits are there anyway!

Hopefully there will be a PROPER soon & this one will get nuked."

,GigglingBhaali,2013-06-03T15:55Z,"Anyone complaining about the deaths of ""Main Characters"" I would advise you read the books and understand what a complex and adult narrative is.  The dead this season were never POV characters and even if they were one of the big selling points of the story is that it is highly realistic.  There are no ""Good"" or ""Bad"" guys.  No one has plot armor.  There is no MAIN CHARACTER.  "
,AznKingJT,2013-06-03T16:22Z,"Honestly, if any of you people read the books GRRM has many different POV charatcers each book, often changing them up and adding in new perspectives. There is no main house, character, good houses, bad houses. All the whiners just have never read the books before"
,thorrus,2013-06-03T16:26Z,"@GigglingBhaali ""There are no ""Good"" or ""Bad"" guys.""
Bullshit. Good and evil are always distinguishable, especially if we are talking about characters like Starks and most of the Lannisters. Quit hallucinating and exalting of this story"

,Grotslag,2013-06-03T21:42Z,"All you kids crying about the ending need to grow the fuck up. This is an adult show, its not all happiness and ponys and rainbows. Its nice to watch a show and not know exactly what the fuck is going to happen. No one has plot armor, anyone can die at any point, thats what makes it exciting.  If you want another story where you know exactly how its going to end through the entire thing then go watch iron man 3 or some other shit they are playing in theaters now."

,Canadian_KO,2013-06-03T22:19Z,"To all who don't like the show because of this episode's events:

Was this episode too mean or plot-changing for you? Do you want to be spoon-fed the same-old stereotypical good-guy bad-guy relationship you get from any other current day drama? You raging or not, it won't change how ""writers"" take their content directly and fully from the -already written books-. It is good that they've followed the books nearly perfectly rather than changing the entire plot and point of the story to suit the viewer's needs. 

Shorter version: If you don't like surprises, this isn't the show for you. If it helps, don't like a character too much because they're most likely (read the damn books if you want) going to die."

,euphya,2013-06-03T23:54Z,I am sad at this episode but can appreciate it happening. In a good show/book you should always be on your toes...what kind of 8 book series doesn't have moments like this. I only wish I hadn't read the comments prior to viewing.

[T],GIANNIS511,2013-06-04T01:07Z,"Really now all of you who didn't like the episode what did you expect from a series that is based on a book? Not to follow the basic lines or maybe change everything? Martin chose and chooses what will happen in the story and the writers of the series follow his basic rules. If that didn't happen, the series would not be named Game of Thrones, but something else. Now if you want or do not want to keep watching GoT is up to you, but it's really stupid to complain."
,trace535,2013-06-04T01:57Z,"I hate it when filmmakers have no idea how to portray throats getting cut realistically. YOU DON'T PASS OUT INSTANTLY just because the front of your trachea has been cut! That only happens if you directly sever the jugular or carotid vessels, which are at the sides.

Even with a deep frontal cut, it still leaves you with at least 60 to 90 seconds of usable consciousness."
