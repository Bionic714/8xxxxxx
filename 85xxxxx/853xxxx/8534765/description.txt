Hello all! I ONLY upload torrents that are well organised and excellent quality.


Audio files are encoded in MAXIMUM QUALTIY VBR, LAME mp3 from FLAC files. Better than/just as good as CBR 320 with much smaller file sizes.
All tracks are named correctly and tagged with hi res album art (500x500) minimum. 

Enjoy! Don't be a douche bag, seed for others!
