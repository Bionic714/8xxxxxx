It explains how your subconscious mind works, the laws it obeys, and ten proven methods for using it easily and effortlessly. One lesson even gives you four ways to communicate with your subconscious mind and an explanation of why talking to it and making it your best friend are important. Once you have this information, you can use your genie to achieve goals, be more creative, change undesirable traits, and improve your health.
