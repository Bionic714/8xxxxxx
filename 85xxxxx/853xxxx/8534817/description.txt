Nature Documentary hosted by Peter Coyote, published by National Geographic in 2008 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

National Geographic Explorer investigates the execution-style murder of six mountain gorillas in Virunga National Park. Their search reveals corruption and how Virunga has become one of the most dangerous places on earth. In July 2008 a haunting photo comes out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It depicts a family of six rare mountain gorillas after being shot to death at point blank range. The first gorilla that we came across was lying on her back. She'd been shot. And she was obviously pregnant.
The world is shocked. Why would anyone kill these charismatic creatures? This is the story of a land under siege and a team of park rangers that are fighting back, risking their lives to save one of the world's most endangered species.
