Thamos, König in Ägypten
KV 345 (336a)

Incidental music and choruses by Wolfgang A. Mozart
circa 1776 - 1780

Performed by the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists
Conducted by John Eliot Gardiner

Performed on period instruments, in a style replicating that of Mozart's era.

This is not the complete CD, I arranged the tracks on a CD-R for my own enjoyment and left out alternate (early) versions of the choruses which appear on the official Archiv CD as Tracks 1 and 6. In their place I put the more full-bodied final versions of these choruses.

I've also included a PDF of the vocal score with this torrent, as I no longer have the CD booklet with the text in it.  Even if you don't understand the words, the choruses are very enjoyable.  

"Thamos" was a stage play to which music was added for the hell of it.
