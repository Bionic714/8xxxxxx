Coverage of the friendly encounter at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, as Roy Hodgson's men face Brazil for the second time in five months. The previous encounter took place at Wembley Stadium in February as part of the Football Association's 150th anniversary celebrations, and saw England claim their first victory over the South Americans in 23 years. A Wayne Rooney goal gave the home side a 1-0 lead at half-time, which was subsequently cancelled out when Fred punished a defensive error just three minutes into the second period. However, Frank Lampard continued his goalscoring exploits after coming on from the substitutes' bench, netting from the edge of the box on the hour mark to restore the lead that they never relinquished. Commentary by Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend
