,mousek801,2013-06-03T09:18Z,"Yep, it's legit, quality isn't too bad either. Though there is a bunch of crap in the torrent file, does TvTeam actually think anyone does anything but delete or select ""do not download"" with those files. 

Plus what kind of moron puts two of the exact same text files in the same folder under two different names? By the way, neither of which anyone is going to read... ever. Who looks at the ""readme"" for a single video file torrent?"
,Meccy01,2013-06-03T10:08Z,"I certainly don't read them. Honestly, I get annoyed whenever a TV torrent has more than one file. Only one file is necessary and any more than that means there's junk in the torrent. All of those readmes, adverts, and samples only serve to clutter my download folder.

With that said, I thank you for the upload."
