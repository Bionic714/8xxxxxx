,msftdoll,2013-06-06T13:21Z,"Hi atndigcrk! Nice work. Thank you for uploading this. I was just wondering if you can upload an iTunes rip of all the Kardashians seasons? Including the spin-offs? The Mega-pack uploaded here is not itunes rip and very low quality. Hoping to get a reply from you, thanks."
