Hello,
This is a very good collection of Python books. These books are geared towards python 3.X specifically.

Books included in this collection are:

Learning Python Fourth Edition ---&gt; This is the book you should read as a complete noob.

Programming Python 4th Edition ---&gt; If you have completed the above book, you can not start with this advanced level book.

Python Pocket Reference Fourth Edition  ---&gt; This should help you along the way multiple times.

TIP FROM THE UPLOADER: if you are trying to self-teach programming, please take a look at codeacademy.com // it is a non-profit site, helped me overcome the inertia of the initial learning curve. I hope everyone can learn how to code, the world will be a better place.
