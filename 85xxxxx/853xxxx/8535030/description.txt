The Gothic period is one of the first epochs in art history from which artworks of all kinds have been preserved: from cathedrals, castles, and palaces to masterful paintings and the most filigree works of goldsmiths, The Essence of Culture: Gothic displays the breadth and richness of a unique craftsmanship. Specific contributions delve into the development of Gothic architecture in France, as well as the national characteristics it took on from Spain and Portugal to northern and eastern Europe. Entire chapters are devoted to the Papal Palace of Avignon and the splendor of Gothic glass painting. This volume provides an overview of the artistic diversity of the Gothic ΓÇô in no small part through the richness of the illustrations ΓÇô that could scarcely be more vivid.
For this work, editor Rolf Toman gathered a team of eleven renowned authors with profound expertise in the fields of architecture and art history whose competent knowledge clearly elucidates the art of the Gothic period.
