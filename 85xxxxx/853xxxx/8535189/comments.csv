One possible request:
Willis Barnstone: The Restored New Testament

Sure, it has Gnostic additions, which other than ""Thomas"", don't seem to add to it. Yet the translation flows very well. His editorial work is interesting; ex.: placing the ""Logos"" section at the beginning of the ""Gospel of John"" as the first piece to start the New Testament itself. Also is his version of restored names to places and people. Which along with the commentary, adds great weight to symbolism, historical identity and geographic meaning."
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-04T01:12Z,"Yes, I've wanted to do Barnstone's NT -- his perspective is interesting and unusual. But it's a big project: 1500 pages. We'll see ..."
,thssthnd,2013-06-04T02:53Z,"Hahah, yes... no pressure. That is way too much though; thanks anyway. Perhaps there'll be a digital release soon.
I wonder if Barnstone would mind... I'm quite sure the Other involved wouldn't have too much of a problem releasing His work publicly."
