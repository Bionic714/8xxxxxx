...so, here's a dummied down version of the upper half of my description:


Walking With Dinosaurs (BBC - TV Series 1999)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214382/

...plus:
The Making of 'Walking with Dinosaurs' (TV 1999)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217641/


	Take the ultimate journey back in time to the reign of the dinosaurs!  State-of-the-art digital effects and animatronics by the Emmy Award-winning FrameStore Group (""The Odyssey"", ""Merlin"", ""Gulliver's Travels"") combine to form living, breathing images that put you in the scene of a virtual lost world.

	Using the latest scientific findings, Walking With Dinosaurs examines the 155-million-year history of these great creatures, from the aggressive Coelophysis, who first learned to hunt in packs, to Tyrannosaurus Rex, the most terrifying carnivore on the planet.  Feel the ground tremble as dueling Triceratops lock horns, and soar with Ornithocheirus, who could travel over 300 miles on a single wing flap.

	Narrated by Kenneth Branagh, this expanded video edition contains fascinating additional material not included on Discovery Channel broadcasts, giving you the most comprehensive and exciting view of prehistoric life ever created!"
,Albe_Sure,2013-06-04T05:13Z,"After NOT finding one single QUALITY torrent either here or on KAT for the original 6-part BBC series ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" (so that I could share its sheer awesomeness with my young son), I decided to go looking for a physical copy.  I found a copy at my local public library and after a 2-3 week wait, I was able to go snatch it up! ;)

And so, here you have it!  I did go through some deliberation as to whether I should simply RIP and post the full 2-disc (DVD 9 and DVD 5) set, or, re-encode it into MPEG-4 format.  After a fair amount of testing on my 42"" high-definition screen, I opted to go with a copy of the latter that included a ""pass-thru"" English 2.0 channel Stereo AAC track along with English/Spanish subs.

I really didn't go to all THAT great of length on this one, but this was at least a ""minor"" labor of love...and I hope that you'll enjoy it.

All the best! ;)


-A.S.

p.s.  Like I said in my description, PLEASE SEED THIS TORRENT (or, much like the dinosaurs themselves, it will disappear).  Also, please do take just a moment to write a brief comment of ""thanks"" and/or to rate the quality of this share.  Much appreciated! :D"
,Apache_Pieman,2013-06-10T18:05Z,"After going back to the comment i left on that other Walking with Dinosaurs torrent, i noticed your provided link.

I've queued this up in uTorrent, and i'm looking forward to checking it out - it looks like you've put a great deal of love putting this up, and for that i thank you, my friend. When it downloads i'll post back with results (and definitely seed!), however, given the nature that i have only a few hundred MBs left on my hdd, i'm forced to either delete some space or just wait until i get an external hdd.

In any case though, cheers, man."
