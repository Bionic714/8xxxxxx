	Take the ultimate journey back in time to the reign of the dinosaurs!  State-of-the-art digital effects and animatronics by the Emmy Award-winning FrameStore Group (ΓÇ£The OdysseyΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£MerlinΓÇ¥, ΓÇ£GulliverΓÇÖs TravelsΓÇ¥) combine to form living, breathing images that put you in the scene of a virtual lost world.

	Using the latest scientific findings, Walking With Dinosaurs examines the 155-million-year history of these great creatures, from the aggressive Coelophysis, who first learned to hunt in packs, to Tyrannosaurus Rex, the most terrifying carnivore on the planet.  Feel the ground tremble as dueling Triceratops lock horns, and soar with Ornithocheirus, who could travel over 300 miles on a single wing flap.

	Narrated by Kenneth Branagh, this expanded video edition contains fascinating additional material not included on Discovery Channel broadcasts, giving you the most comprehensive and exciting view of prehistoric life ever created!
