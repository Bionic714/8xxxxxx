The epic collection of the cosmic event begins here! Heroes will die. Villains and heroes will form allegiances. Empires will fall. A destructive force punctures through the edge of our universe and slaughters millions of worlds

The Annihilation Wave has come! Annihilus, lord of the Negative Zone, has declared war! Hordes of loyal soldiers swarm from the center of the universe, and only a handful of heroes can resist destruction!

This torrent has the whole Annihilation event collected in it. They are all high quality digital scans (excluding the What If story at the end). I didn't include the Thanos series as that isn't collected in the trades and no digital scan is available for it. You can find the whole series uploaded by Ketaros if you search 'Thanos' using the Pirate Bay search engine I plan to also upload the rest of the Marvel cosmic events with their ndigital scans: Annihilation Conquest, War of Kings, Realm of Kings, etc. I don't know when they will be upload, but hopefully Annihilation Conquest should be uploaded by Sunday. I'm following this guide http://i.imgur.com/FUM3v.jpg I'm currently looking for digital scans of Guardians of the Galaxy 19-25, and everything past Ris and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire. If anyone has links to torrents or download pages which contain them, I would greatly appreciate t if you could share them.
