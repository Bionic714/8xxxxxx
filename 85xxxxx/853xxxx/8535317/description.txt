The Rhino 5 development process started more than five years ago with one overriding goal to remove as many of your workflow bottlenecks as possible. That meant making Rhino faster and able to handle much larger models and project teams, in addition to making thousands of large and small improvements.

Modeling
Object creation in Rhino continues to be enhanced. Rhino 5 adds dozens of refinements to existing tools, some new commands, and the new lightweight extrusion objects.

Editing
Editing complex models is faster and easier with hundreds of new and enhanced commands including:

Direct subΓÇæobject manipulation
ThinΓÇæwall shelling
History support for more commands
Dozens of new and enhanced commands
