Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 1 + Unaired Pilot (PAL DVD Remux)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This release is compiled from my own PAL DVD collection which means you get:
- Original DVD video stream in lossless quality
- Original DVD audio tracks in lossless quality
- Commentary tracks
- English subtitles
- Chapters, for easier navigation
- All the extras from the DVD's
- Widescreen format in seasons 4-7

Everything is muxed into a .mkv container, for hassle-free playback.
You get all the benefits from the DVD's without having to navigate tedious menus.

If there's sufficient interest in this release, I'll upload the rest of the series as well (including season 8, the 1992 movie and the bonus disc that were only available in The Chosen Collection Box)


A NOTE ON FRAMERATE:
Since this is the PAL version of the series, it has a framerate of 25 fps, unlike the US release which runs at 23.976 fps.
This means the PAL version is slightly speeded up, and the audio has a slightly higher pitch.
Most people won't be able to hear it, but if it's something you care about, I can recommend taking a look at a software called ReClock from SlySoft. It will force your video player to slow the framerate down to the original
In that way, you can enjoy the widescreen transfer of the series, with the original framerate.
