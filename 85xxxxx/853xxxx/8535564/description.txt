This program is capable of downloading video from sites like these:
 
http://www.comedycentral.com/

 
http://www.thedailyshow.com/

Because of that, Adobe used the DCMA to delete it from SourceForge, Github, and all other sites it could find. Let's keep the code alive!

Tested on Windows 7.
