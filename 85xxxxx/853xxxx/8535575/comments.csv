,robdave,2013-06-15T14:14Z,"Note that the 1st book, A Case Of Conscience, has 3 missing pages and about 30 typos.  These issues have been corrected in an improved edit at this link:
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8577131
It also includes a table of contents with chapters.

The other books in this torrent are the retail versions, so should be good."
