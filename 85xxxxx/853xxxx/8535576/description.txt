Two women - one white, one Mohawk, both single mothers faced with desperate circumstances - are drawn into the world of border smuggling across the frozen water of the St. Lawrence River, from Canada to the US. Both women swear each trip will be their last, but one final run across the river leads to a showdown with the law on all sides.
