In 2011, Red Tail Ring released two studio recordings featuring a unique two-way connection between old and new- I. Middlewest Chant showcases the duoΓÇÖs original songs and II. Mountain Shout features the duoΓÇÖs favorite traditional tunes. These projects blend the loving attention of revivalist fervor with the raw creativity of brand new sounds. Whether rendering a traditional tune or one of their many original compositions, the duo infuses each song with musical imagination, haunting harmonies and instrumental artistry. The two projects are separate but intertwined - companion pieces that stand alone but also complement one another. Beauchamp explains, ΓÇ£We love pushing the boundaries of what a traditional song can be - thereΓÇÖs a real energy exchange between the old and the new.ΓÇ¥ In this pair of new releases, Red Tail Ring offers listeners originality and traditionalism in every cut. He adds, ΓÇ£For us, the dichotomy is always there: the precision and grit of the music, the stories that speak to the core of human experience and tell our story at the same time."

All songs on Mountain Shout are traditional except for "Vamp For John," and homage to John Hartford, written by Michael Beauchamp and Laurel Premo.
