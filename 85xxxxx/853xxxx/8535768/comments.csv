,topk,2013-06-03T20:35Z,"BOZX = greatest rip quality

and fuck saving on file size"
,jimaa66,2013-06-03T23:35Z,"File size? FILE SIZE??
you are so right, topk. And Bozx gives you 4 or 5 different sizes per movie anyways!
Ever notice (YIFY), who's files are always out there first? With perfect quality?? And usually DTS???
Bozx- you are the King."
,panemoj,2013-06-04T00:44Z,"BOZX has best movies ( best quality ), but worst seeders...
Best movies with best quality/size has anoXmous..."
,guitargeo,2013-06-04T05:22Z,no seeders!!!!!!!!
,ps7825,2013-06-04T11:54Z,Death to YIFY on top 100 page. BOZX is the best!
,warlockzer,2013-06-04T14:15Z,"Isn't this better?: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8535762 Why so much leechers on this, while -MARKED release have better bitrate?"
,paerchu,2013-06-04T16:16Z,"""Ever notice (YIFY), who's files are always out there first? With perfect quality?? And usually DTS???""

Not to mention that it has a perfect resolution but comes with poor bitrate and a cheap 2 channel audio. Good for mobile devices but ruins the HD section of this torrent site. Thank god there's an uploader like bozx lol "
,flashos,2013-06-04T19:24Z,Thank you!!!!
,thereisnoother,2013-06-05T08:24Z,"In response to ""paerchu"" a couple of posts above, none of the movies on Pirate Bay have ""perfect"" resolution. I am on an 80"" LCD and an experienced eye can definitely and very clearly tell the difference between 1080P from a BluRay compared to 1080P from BOZX's highest quality rips. These are compressed files so there is no way they will be exactly the same as watching from the disk, and on an 80"" even sitting 14' away from the screen, the quality is not even close ...it's closer to 1080i, which is pretty much worse than 720P. Nevertheless, the movies are still very enjoyable ...especially the 3D ones. So I am not complaining one bit, especially since they are FREE! :-)

But let's get one thing straight once and for all - BOZX's (or PublicHD's) rips are intended for home entertainment systems (thus the surround sound/larger files) and YiFy's are ideal for portable devices (stereo sound, smaller files). And with BOZX's files, you do not want to stream the file wirelessly because the bitrate is too high. You will get stuttering audio /video during the ""busier"" scenes unless your wireless signal is consistently above 20-30+ MBPS (depending on the movie begin watched) ."
,topk,2013-06-05T20:45Z,"BOZX = the best, period.

I don't get complainers about seed. I have normal for 2013 fast internet ~60Mbps, I download this in 10 minutes. I never have any problems with this seed seed seed shit.
Just lrn2settings and you will have happiness"
,topk,2013-06-05T20:47Z,"@warlockzer I chose this one because I sorted by Leechers and then looked for teh top BOZX title, I overlooked the one you showed - I should've indeed gotten that one instead!"
,Skram0,2013-06-06T06:54Z,"What I don't get is the 2 release dates of this movie.. IMDb states it as 2012, where blu-ray.com states it as 2013.

Just because it was presented at TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) in 2012, I guess some figure it was released on that date.

Oh well. Just leave out the year when searching this site and you'll find more hits."
,virus858,2013-06-06T10:50Z,u already kno its bozx! thanks man!
,hxxq,2013-06-06T14:30Z,"AV=10
Movie 7.5/10

in my personal opinion any movie wid good story,
right sound,right music,right camerawork always enjoyable.. beyond the pines is good movie of ryan gosling since drive"
,df03anma,2013-06-06T19:13Z,Anyone who knows if there are any subs out yet? I only found danish. Would ofcourse prefer Swedish but English will do fine..
,topk,2013-06-06T19:23Z,"Rip quality = 10
Movie = 6

First part is a rip off of Drive, right down to the kind of background music.
Second part is just as uninspired and derivative, only sans Gosling.

Also, I figured out Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling is a fashion model who is acting as a movie actor.
The less Ryan Gosling opens his mouth the better he looks."
,letisa,2013-06-08T02:26Z,@topk Definitely one of those pricks who only watched Drive and think they know all about Ryan Gosling's acting. Wonder when that's gonna stop. Try watching one more movie or two before saying that crap.
,Tyler2106,2013-06-08T06:56Z,"Thank you!  Another great torrent!  

I thought the movie sucked but it's a great quality download.  "
,topk,2013-06-09T05:16Z,"@letisa, actually there's one good movie with Gosling, which also happens to be the movie I loved loong before anyone even knew of Gosling - The Believer (2001). I love this movie because I can really relate to it, being myself both a Jew and a Nazi sympathizer.
Now if only someone in the whole wide world would start offering for sale the movie poster, I can't find it anywhere! "
,joegi50,2013-06-10T22:36Z,Thanks BOZX.
,etbk,2013-06-12T09:03Z,thanks bozx
