,Sebbe_wtf,2013-06-03T18:01Z,"So? IMDB is being very reluctant on the nature of this film. Perhaps someone on tpb can tell me if this film is time well spent, a flawless gem. Or if it's just another giant turd?

,Decyde,2013-06-03T19:56Z,Hard coded subs for the parts when the trolls talk would be nice but if they are suppose to not be understood then never mind!
,cacce,2013-06-03T20:04Z,"Since half the cast in this movie also did ""Osombie"" A brilliant idea of a film with a Bin Laden gone zombie, rofl btw. 
Ill doubt it goes under the ""a gem"" category"
,freeegatee,2013-06-03T20:11Z,"Thanks, will comment later"
,swine666,2013-06-03T21:09Z,Whoever is into J.R.R.Tolkien books better wait for the other hobbit film in december. Id rather take a 1h45min crap in the shitter and think about life than watch this
,dafix123,2013-06-03T21:23Z,"Seems to be a private movie, acting and side effects seem lame. It is supposed to be a LOTR side story, that is as much I got from youtube."
,dafix123,2013-06-03T21:24Z,"I would also link you to trailer, but apparently you cannot post youtube links here. Just search for ""Saga The Shadow Cabal Trailer (2013)"""
,Sebbe_wtf,2013-06-03T22:08Z,Thx for the answers. Seems like another turd fuck... But I probably end up watching it anyway.   
,mmosakuji,2013-06-04T04:08Z,oh heavens... you couldn't pay me to DL this
,Squareyes,2013-06-04T06:14Z,"I assume this movie is really bad.  It is always better to expect the worst before you watch. That way you might be pleasantly surprised. 

Either way, thanks for the up laval"
,jesusman82,2013-06-04T07:00Z,yes it appears to be a giant turd. but so have other things like dale and tucker vs evil or even that ringworld thing scfy did
,judgedreader,2013-06-04T22:06Z,"B+ movie. Costumes, makeup were magnificent. Acting not so good. The yellow haired girl does not fit in this movie very well at all.

Looks like another LoTR ripoff."
,yotis,2013-06-06T05:04Z,"Movie not worth it 2/10 for costumes and effects. Terrible actors, too much talking. Plain bad."

M = LOL

Movie had a few moments that weren't too bad but overall it's a low budget b-grade clunker. The reason no IMDB info is because it isn't released until August so coutos on the up.

Cheers"

,punkrockdk,2013-06-06T19:33Z,"Has anyone succeeded in finding english subtitles for this movie? 

Preferably for hearing impared, but any english sub will do. Thanks

And thanks to uploader."
,MrIks,2013-06-06T23:27Z,I didn't watch it. I saw trailer of this movie and is a fucking joke :D

M-2 if you like early 10 minute 90s 1v1 type fighting in a crappy world of warcraft world this is for you"
,somedude72,2013-06-15T02:28Z,"The movie is rated M for ""meh"". Makeup and costuming are surprisingly good but overall it's like watching the cut scenes from a video game ""story"".

My only problem with the video itself is that there are lengthy stretches of orcs talking to each other in orcspeak gobbleygook and no subtitles, so I have no idea what they're saying."
