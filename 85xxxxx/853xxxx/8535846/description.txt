One part gambler, two parts charmer, Trevor Malloy has finally met his match.

Book 5 of the Malloy family series.

Trevor Malloy loves women of all shapes and sizes. When he bets a small fortune on a hand of poker only to lose to a lady gambler he canΓÇÖt seem to charm, he finds himself beholden to a woman for the first time.

Adelaide Burns refuses to fall under TrevorΓÇÖs spell and is determined to make him pay every cent he owes herΓÇöin muscle and sweat.

Like sparks from flint and rock, Trevor and Adelaide nearly set the sheets on fire. Together they find heaven in each others arms, fight for AdelaideΓÇÖs saloon, and face a future that only the luck of the cards will tell.
