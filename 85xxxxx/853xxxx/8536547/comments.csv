Not sure if it's possible, but do you still have The Talk - Katey Sagal from 9-12-12 available to seed?

I've had the torrent queued for a while but it hasn't moved.

Thanks either way. I'll help seed your latest interviews upload along with some older stuff I am still seeding.

[V],thetorrentlord,2013-06-03T19:37Z,@mmcc11: I'll check and get back to you asap on my most current post.
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-06-03T19:46Z,"@mmcc11: You do realize that the torrent is over 8 months old. I am reseeding as this is being written, but not at full speed to be fair to newer torrents."
,mmcc11,2013-06-04T01:46Z,"@TL

Yea, I knew it was old. I was hesitant to ask but wasn't sure what your stance was on stuff like that. Thanks for the seed and I'll know better in the future."
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-06-04T16:35Z,"@mmcc11: Don't be afraid to ask about anything,  as it just depends if it has been deleted or not. I seed most of my torrents at reduced speed for at least 6 months,sometimes longer if there are still peers showing on my torrent client. KEEP ON SEEDING!!!!"
