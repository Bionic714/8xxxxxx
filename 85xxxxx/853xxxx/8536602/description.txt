"In this noncommercial film Brodsky is presented not so much as the genius poet, but Brodsky as we have never known him, despite his verses and essays, where it would seem he opened up to us completely. Here he is new to us!-faithful in friendship, capable of maintaining warm, personable ties for decades. This Brodsky was revealed to us in Angel mail" (Washington Post)
