You can now use your phone as an Infrared Remote (IR Remote) Why should you need to 

use more than one remote for all the devices you own ? With Smart InfraRed Remote for 

your HTC One, you can add, create and customize any number of remotes, combining 

controls from any of your existing remotes. Imagine a single remote on which the 

CHANNEL UP button controls your Set Top Box from your TV provider, the VOLUME keys 

control your home theater system and the arrow keys control your TV's menu. 

Minimum Requirements: Android OS 4.1 and up
