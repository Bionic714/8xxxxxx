,darkrats,2013-06-03T23:33Z,"Thanks for the fine post. I see the PDF is a conversion from the ebook. While it's very much appreciated, I would like to know if anyone has a true PDF of this title. Conversions always, despite the best of intentions, look like crap. The letter are huge, margins are non-existent, and the layout is just plain wrong."
