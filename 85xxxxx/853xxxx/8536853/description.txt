Trypes (Greek: ╬ñ╧ü╧ì╧Ç╬╡╧é), which translates in English as "Holes" were a highly influential and acclaimed Greek rock band, originating from Thessaloniki, Greece. Their unique sound emerged mainly from the combination of vocalist Giannis Aggelakas' distinctive singing style and lyrics and Giorgos Karras' Post-punk and Alternative Rock instrumentation. They have produced landmark albums like Enia pliromena tragoudia (Nine paid songs) and Kefali gemato chrysafi (Head Full of Gold) which not only were commercially successful, but are also considered to be masterpieces of Greek Rock discography.
