,Bean-Bandit,2013-06-04T07:04Z,"Don't think it really matters if you have a evga card or not. Both MSI Afterburner and eVGA Precision X are all based off of Riva Tuner which as we all know was dc'ed sometime ago.

If I'm not mistaken it's all based off of the gpu which isn't made by either of them."
