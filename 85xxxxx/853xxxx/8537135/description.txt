A brilliantly illuminating and darkly comic tale of the ongoing financial and political crisis in America
 
The financial crisis that exploded in 2008 isnΓÇÖt past but prologue. The grifter classΓÇömade up of the largest players in the financial industry and the politicians who do their biddingΓÇöhas been growing in power, and the crisis was only one terrifying manifestation of how theyΓÇÖve hijacked AmericaΓÇÖs political and economic life.

Matt Taibbi has combined deep sources, trailblazing reportage, and provocative analysis to create the most lucid, emotionally galvanizing account yet written of this ongoing American crisis. He offers fresh reporting on the backroom deals of the bailout; tells the story of Goldman Sachs, the ΓÇ£vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanityΓÇ¥; and uncovers the hidden commodities bubble that transferred billions of dollars to Wall Street while creating food shortages around the world.

This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the labyrinthine inner workings of this country, and the profound consequences for us all.
