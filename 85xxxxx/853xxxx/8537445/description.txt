Cream Trance Anthems Ibiza 2009 is a triple-disc trance mix including a lot of tracks that were popular in Ibiza in 2009. Cream is a superclub in Liverpool, England, that for years has hosted a Thursday night club night at Amnesia in Ibiza. One of innumerable mix albums released each year by Ministry of Sound, likewise an English superclub with a global presence, Cream Trance Anthems Ibiza 2009 is a typical release by the label. There is a lot of music here, 60 tracks spread out across three CDs, 20 tracks each, and there are popular tracks by some of the biggest trance producers in the business. The first disc alone boasts trance favorites by Chicane, Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren, and Ferry Corsten. That's just the first four tracks. The second disc has an abundance of trance classics like Robert Miles' "Children," Three Drives' "Greece 2000," Nalin & Kane's "Beachball," Darude's "Standstorm," and ATB's "9PM (Till I Come)." Best of all is the surprise inclusion of Underworld's "Born Slippy." It's not trance, but it's classic all the same. The third and final disc includes a selection of up-and-coming trance producers like Deadmau5, Pryda, and Sebastian Ingrosso, plus trance veterans like Ferry Corsten, Agnelli & Nelson, and Cygnus X. There's a lot to like about Cream Trance Anthems Ibiza 2009. The unfortunate aspect of the album is the uninspiring DJ mix. In fact, it's not a DJ mix so much as it is an automated mix where the tracks are cross-faded predictably into one another. The mixing lacks the touch of a real DJ. This isn't a big deal if you're drawn to the impressive track selection rather than the mix itself. After all, this is a Ministry of Sound release, and those familiar with the brand know not to except an ace DJ mix but rather a stylish packaged multi-disc compilation of club favorites.. - Review by Jason Birchmeier
