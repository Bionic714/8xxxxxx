,culo_mahogany,2013-06-05T00:36Z,This is a brilliant undertaking.  Can we get a standard quality version to go along with it?
,eyezonme,2013-06-05T02:56Z,"This isn't the entire season, several episodes are missing. Also, the episode titles are all incorrect."
,projecthotmess,2013-06-05T06:52Z,"Eyezonme, this is a re-edit so that the story moves in chronological order rather than the interwoven way the original cuts were.  Because of that there run times, episode count and titles are different."
