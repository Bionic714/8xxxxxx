Biographical study of one of the greatest of American jazz
divas, Anita O'Day, who died in 2006 at the age of 87. This
story of bop vocalist O'Day's long and sometimes troubled career
which attained a high water mark with her riveting performance
of Sweet Georgia Brown in the classic Jazz on a Summer's Day
film at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1958, is full of typically
candid interviews with O'Day herself and tracks her career
from classic performances in the 50s with such artists as
Louis Armstrong, Gene Krupa and Hoagy Carmichael to her last
album recorded at the age of 84. She speaks openly about how
she battled with her addictions to heroin and alcohol and how
her singing career came before her personal happiness.
Interviewees include Dick Clark, Annie Ross and Johnny Mandel.
