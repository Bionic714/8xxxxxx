,Stoltz84,2013-06-04T00:45Z,Thank you! ^_^
,Aitorvr,2013-06-04T00:58Z,How is it posible that the game requires 150MB and the size of the files are 654.74MiB?
,ZtorkX86,2013-06-04T01:26Z,"About 570 megabytes worth of extras (commentaries, early alpha..)"
,RivalElite,2013-06-04T01:40Z,I normally do not seed for more than a day but for this game ill do it for about a month. Does anyone know how to set up a seedbox?
,demonki11er,2013-06-04T01:47Z,I have never heard of a 654 mb game needing to mount...
,reenmini,2013-06-04T02:04Z,"This is the first I've seen of ""Group WaL-MarT"" and I am most intrigued as to why any group of pirates would choose ""Wal-Mart"" as their brand name, so to speak."
,Timbo6669,2013-06-04T02:24Z,WAL-MART will be like a acronym for their names or places im guessing..
,seif13,2013-06-04T03:34Z,"I love how this torrent already has so many seeds and leeches! It's like everyone kept refreshing until this was finally uploaded by someone. That just proves that it's a good game. Oh and it's an indie game too. It took the guy three years to make it. So, how about this: Let's all go buy the game when we get the money. Oh, I am a pirate at heart. But some rare occasions like these just make me want to buy the game. That's exactly what I'm going to do. In about 30 minutes time. 

Have a nice day seeders!!"
,RivalElite,2013-06-04T03:49Z,I set up one of my servers to seed this at 20MB/s. If it needs more I don't mind helping out
,NetHazard,2013-06-04T05:24Z,"The Stifmeister comes through again.

@demonki11er Obviously you haven't been around that long then."
,wadbr,2013-06-04T06:07Z,I fucking love groups that put some info with their releases (even though I understand about 10% of it)
,paragonassassin,2013-06-04T06:16Z,"Whenever I try to run the setup it'll ask for the setup language, then it'll minimize, stop responding, and close out.

Anyone have the same issue?"
,Hyaitus,2013-06-04T13:09Z,"I've been waiting all day for this. Such a fantastic game. Seriously, indie devs don't get the love they deserve. As soon as I get the cash, I'll buy this. It's the least he could get for making such a great game. "
,j01,2013-06-04T15:49Z,"I registered an account just to say that the pure indie heart in this game has convinced me to purchase it to support the developers.

I hope you guys will consider doing the same, if you can. These devs are total bros."
,Capnmaf,2013-06-04T17:39Z,Those are some funky chip-tunes WaL-MaRT.
,Talor6475,2013-06-07T00:39Z,"@Aitorvr Eh, Fuck logic, just do it! ;)"
,NecroFile,2013-06-09T10:33Z,"""Demonki11er: I have never heard of a 654 mb game needing to mount...""

So you've never heard of a CD-ROM?
