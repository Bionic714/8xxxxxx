          Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle game that lets you rewire its levels to trick

          people. You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break

          into high security buildings and steal sensitive data.

          Recently our releases with cracked SteamWorks protection got nuked for:

         
          2w521jq.jpg"

          Well, we used 4 header-files for some hints, e.g. from SteamNetworking.h

          and Stea COGENTs emulator source on 2 our releases, because we

          had trouble making them to work properly.

          Although we used these few header files they are still modified, and the

          actual sourcecode is our own. COGENTs leaked and upped in public steamemu

          doesnt actually work for a tons of newer  games (e.g. caused by

          RemoteStorage, SteamUtils and some other interfaces) and somehow ours does

          (see: Resident.Evil.Revelations.Update.2-WaLMaRT)

          But in general you cant say its stolen. As you can simple google Open-

          SteamWorks and voila. Almost all info you need to make own emulator is

          there 

          and modified a little it: e.g. int32 -&gt; DWORD&gt;.

          The only 2 releases that have a string from a headerfile we accidentaly

          used are:

          Resident.Evil.Revelations.Update.2-WaLMaRT
          iBomber.Defense.Pacific-WaLMaRT

          The rest didnt even use that particular header file and also contain no

          COGENT strings . So all these releases would be an inva-

          lid nuke anyway:

          Patrician.IV.Steam.Special.Edition-WaLMaRT
          Metro.Last.Light.Update.4.Repack-WaLMaRT
          Gothic.3.Forsaken.Gods.Enhanced.Edition-WaLMaRT
          Surgeon.Simulator.2013.Steam.Edition-WaLMaRT

          As a bonus, we also included a screenshot with the folder containing our

          sourcecode as proof. see: http://i.imgur.com/zoR5IA4.png
