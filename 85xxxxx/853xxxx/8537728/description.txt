One night I was sitting on the rug in front of the fireplace with my four best girlfriends having a girlsΓÇÖ night in. We had chocolate fondue (yum!) and champagne and talked for hours - about our careers, our lives, and our relationships. And of course that naturally led down the path of sex. I mean, what kind of night is it if we donΓÇÖt talk about sex?!? :)

Some of us were single, some of us were in relationships. But either way you look at it, we loved talking about what made good sex and what made bad sex. Is it just me or does it seem like sex is everywhere? In fact, every time we were in the checkout line at the grocery store, itΓÇÖs hard to ignore that magazine that talked about the bazillion different sex positions we should be trying out now. And of course, I have to get that issue and talk about it with my girlfriends. And that night, we did.

And boy was that quite a conversation! We got so into it that Danni blurted out something interesting ΓÇô ΓÇ£wouldnΓÇÖt it be fun if we actually tried all these different positions?ΓÇ¥ At that very moment, the light bulb in my head went off. ThereΓÇÖs 5 of us here, why donΓÇÖt we test each position and report back on our favorites?!?
