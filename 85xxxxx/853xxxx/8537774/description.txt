Alright folks, one of the best RPG games (also it was one of the last SNES games ever) developed by  Quintet and published by ENIX. It was released in Japan in late '95. By 1996 an English language officially version translated was released in Europe (PAL) 

The graphics are amazing, the story is superb and the gameplay was way ahead of its time. It's an action rpg that everyone should give a try!

Here we have a patch with #Head (SNES HEAD code) and PAL clock region removed. The NTSC snes games were replaced into  this game so everything was added to play properly on:

Snes 9x emulator for PC (working 100%)
Snes 9x for Wii (tested 100%)
Snes 9x for PS2 (sound and video quality is worse because the emulator project is on hiatus since 2009 and it lacks some DPS. But it does work as well
ZNES emulator for PC
higan v092 (A.K.A BSNES) for PC 32-64bit (working 100%)

The planet possessed two souls.
An external face and an internal face.
Lightside and darkside.
46 billion years since the planet's birth.
Growth and decline circle to two wills.
At the will of lightside, new life is born.
At the will of darkside, ice ages descend.
Lightside wills intelligent beings.
Rapid progress takes root.
Darkside's will breeds fear and disharmony.
They came to be called God and Devil.
================================================================================

Regardless of this inner antagonism, rapid progress took root and primitive life forms evolved to plants, animals, and humans. Technology and industry further expanded civilization, but the fight between God and the Devil was still taking place, more fiercely than ever. The conflict culminated in a final battle in Antarctica, on the surface world. However, neither of the two forces was victorious. The continents of the surface world submerged into the sea and the under world was sealed away.
