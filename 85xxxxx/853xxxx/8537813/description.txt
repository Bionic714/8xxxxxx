Daisy Kutter's bandit days are behind her. She and partner Tom have gone legit, and now she is a respectable small-town citizen, owner of the local general store--and bored out of her mind. Frustration with the tedium of normal life and her own discontents gets her into trouble after she loses the store in a poker game. Mr. Winters, the security mogul who won it, offers a proposition she can't refuse: to test the new security robots on his train. He is willing to pay. In a fit of recklessness, Daisy takes the job. Kibuishi's art and storytelling in his Wild West confection convey a sense that Daisy's world isn't created as much as spontaneously unfolding as you read. His art is a hybrid of the best aspects of both manga and American animation yet is more unique than that suggests. It expresses Daisy's restrained frustration and Tom's aw-shucks likability and also the wide-open space of the Wild West.
