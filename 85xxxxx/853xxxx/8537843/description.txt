Ibex was a pre-Queen band consisting of Freddie Bulsara (Mercury) on vocals, Mike Bersin on guitar, John Taylor on bass, and Mick Smith on drums. There are no known studio recordings, but there was a single live show recorded by roadie Geoff Higgins at the Sink Club in Liverpool. The performance was recorded on a Grundig TK14 reel-to-reel tape machine and later sold to Queen collector John S. Stuart. The tape was borrowed by Queen Productions so that Rain could be included on the Freddie Mercury Solo Collection box set. The tape was leaked to the bootleg market most likely by someone at either EMI or Queen Productions. This concert is notable because Brian May and Roger Taylor joined Ibex for the encore; marking the first known apperance of Freddie, Roger, and Brian live together. Unfortunately, the tape ran out after 30 minutes, so it misses this encore.
