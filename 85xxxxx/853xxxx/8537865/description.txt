From Library Journal

Randall was one of the great American minds of the 20th century, and this was his classic textbook written for Columbia's contemporary civilization course. First published in 1926 and last revised in 1940, this is another book that Gress sees as an example of the Grand Narrative, but as he points out, it was "brilliantly learned and well written." It thus still serves as a solid introduction to the history of ideas for undergraduates and adults.
