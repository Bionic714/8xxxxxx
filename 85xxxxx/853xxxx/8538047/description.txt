In case you havenΓÇÖt heard, the world is ending this Friday, December 21st. Fortunately, New YorkΓÇÖs up and coming popstar Grace Danger has the perfect song to take us all home, ΓÇ£Love Me Like ItΓÇÖs the End of the World.ΓÇ¥
12/21/12 is the last day on the Mayan calendar, and if that isnΓÇÖt startling enough, we recently realized our desk calendars all stop at December 31st this year as well, so things are looking pretty bleak.
You can either fear the end, or you can blow it out with a bang. ΓÇ£Love Me Like ItΓÇÖs the End of the World,ΓÇ¥ votes for the latter. With a radio-ready hook, and the vocal chops to back it up, the appropriately named Grace Danger throws caution to the wind and bets it all on tonight.
