Thanks

According to the files names in the torrent, this is the part II (2013)

@+"
,sykoskit,2013-06-05T14:14Z,"ya is this part 2 or part 1? because the torrent says part 2 2013, not 2010 as labeled... and the picture to the right is part 2, so is this just a mislabel? i appreciate all your work yify, i use all ur torrents to watch movies on my ipod, but i really want to watch part 1 again before watching part 2 that i got from you... so if you have part 1, can you please upload it? or if this is part 1 can you let us know so we can download it... thanks"
,sykoskit,2013-06-05T14:18Z,"nevermind, i figured it out, this is a mislabel. Should be: ""The Last Exorcism Part II (2013) 1080p BrRip x264 - YIFY. if you are looking for part 1, YIFY has it uploaded here http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6276292/The_Last_Exorcism_%282010%29_720p_BrRip_mkv_-_500mb_-_YIFY#filelistContainer"
