,2.5Kburn,2013-06-04T03:24Z,"Is this in refernce to this one, or my (obviously botched) other one?"
,Keka_Umans,2013-06-12T12:48Z,"most likely its in reference to the files contained in the torrent themselves.
no proper filename,
no proper file extension
is it a rar? an iso? who knows...."
,2.5Kburn,2013-06-13T20:59Z,"It's moot now, considering I had an absolutely catostrophic set of computer crashes and lost all my data.
For refernce, it was simply a non-compressed folder containing .avi files.
I'm not sure how I borked creating the torrent.
Seems to only show up as a string of random characters."
