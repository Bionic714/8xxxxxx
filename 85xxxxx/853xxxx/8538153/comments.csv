,Rebellion-432,2013-06-04T08:47Z,"A - 10, V - 10, M - 6, This is probably going to be the only time I'll ever complain on your torrents YIFY and I apologize, but this movie had an awesome trailer, and  two good actors, but the actual movie was really too long for it's own good and I was really disappointed by it.

,Pdid,2013-06-05T02:53Z,"Why would the Blu-Ray case have a cinema release date on it? Lol Anyways; good rip, but movie is too long."

,bensam16,2013-06-06T05:33Z,"great quality, although the movie sucked..."
,Rebellion-432,2013-06-06T05:58Z,"@ jorgeacs20 I'm not a cop,
I just expressed my own opinion on the film."
,kolozz,2013-06-08T00:33Z,Boring. Ryan Gosling sucks.
,dnarmstr,2013-06-08T02:04Z,"Downloaders!
Before wasting your time giving your review of this film, think 'Am I a movie critic? Do complete strangers give half a shit what my opinion is?'

Enjoy!"
,TaiTheGuy,2013-06-10T11:02Z,"I've downloaded enough torrents to know when they're completely finished @ 100%.
It can't just be my copy, but @2h, 8m, 0seconds, the audio COMPLETELY cuts out.
Almost never do I have to STOP watching a film due to poor quality, but this is one of them.
I guess I'll try to get sub's real quick, but maybe others should go with a different upload.
[one of my first 4 or 5 complaints after about 100 YIFY D/L's]"
,TaiTheGuy,2013-06-10T11:10Z,"Not sure if its just me, although if it is, it'd be a first. If not, you too will need these sub's. Which at first glance seem to be perfect.
