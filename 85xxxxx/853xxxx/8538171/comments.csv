RGH though, guess it wont work with my xk3y then. "
,dogmatichangman,2013-06-08T12:02Z,"Well, guess I just had to try my xk3y on this since some ass on a forum said he had gotten DLC working on his xk3y. Maybe that´ll work. Guess I´ll give that a shot... When theres DLC out that´s actually worth the time.

Thanks for the upload anyways! "
