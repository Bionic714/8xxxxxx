Director David A.R> White brings the biblical book of Ester to the screen in this epic tale of heroism. King Xerxes is on the quest for a new queen when he meets Ester, and takes her as his bride. Meanwhile, Ester's cousin Mordecai and the villainous Haman scheme to manipulate King Xerxes and gain control of the kingdom. Later, when Ester discovers Haman's secret plan to bring about the genocide of the Jews, she risks her own life to show King Xerxes the truth, and save her people from a terrible fate. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

,skyspire,2013-06-05T10:46Z,"To people whining about Christians, Esther is in the OLD TESTAMENT, which means it is in the Hebrew Bible.  In other words, this is more a Jewish movie than a Christian movie."

,Durendal123,2013-06-06T00:20Z,Thanks for the warnings. Won't watch this one
,rockyman32826,2013-06-08T06:49Z,What's funny is you Judge God based on our conduct. Since in fact we do our best to be like Him. 
,Polyblendz,2013-06-09T05:57Z,"Apart from everyone judging this movie, this movie would have been alot better if the editors of the movie changed the gradient of the film to give it a more depth feel instead of watching it like they were doing dress rehearsals for a school play if you know what I mean. I like biblical movies but this one needed more convincing actors.
