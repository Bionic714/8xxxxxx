,beezus187,2013-06-07T22:15Z,"Wikipedia can be written by anyone and I go by IMDB which states season 7 is 14 episodes and so does USA. I was watching it the night of when they stated that it was the final episode of this season. So, this is the complete season. Thanks. "

,beezus187,2013-06-13T03:44Z,Which in turn is a 2 hr Christmas special and still not accounted for in this season which is why episode 14 states that it is the season finale.
