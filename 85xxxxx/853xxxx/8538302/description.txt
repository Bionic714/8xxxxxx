 Fierce Leadership is a solid reminder not to fall into the traps of the so called "best practices" that permeate even smaller but bureaucratic companies. In a nutshell the proscriptive advice is to have frank and open conversations with colleagues both above and below instead of hunkering into a shell or trying to work around people in the organization that, at least in your eyes, do not pull their weight. It is an excellent diagnosis of what is wrong with the leadership in many companies, and offers a way to insert yourself into the process.
