,WakeDude,2013-06-04T07:52Z,ok. ty
,Tankerbot,2013-06-04T09:16Z,"Ignoring the quality of the release, the big logo stamped on the video during the entire length of the video is obnoxious as hell and just turns this into garbage. Why must this particular scene group advertise it self so heavily in the video?

If you want people to know who release this, then use a smaller logo that is perhaps not overlapping the video.

Place it down in the letterboxed area and make it not as obtrusive to the movies viewing experience. Because at this point people will just see you as a bunch of assholes and will avoid your group. It's counterproductive."
,AdTacTown31,2013-06-04T11:00Z,"I have NEVER ONCE posted 1 single solitary comment on thepiratebay in over 4 years, but.....this is retarded, Watermarks and shyt recordings can only be done on purpose, most of the time. Do shills upload these in hopes we go pay and watch the movie? with anticipation. I, the royal me can and have recorded better video in 2002 with a shyt cell phone. You suck period, even though I know it wasn't you who personally recorded this with a cam in the theater, get a f'ing brain and learn how to use a camera, all I'm saying. Ohh yea, you suck whoever recorded this, opps look n further than the water mark, opps again.... wait, he didn't record this...... "
,MehtaRahulC,2013-06-04T11:55Z,"Dear Freeloaders,

For past 4 days, I have been searching and searching across 10s of sites for a NYSM torrent. And there had been 10s of fakes (like exe). And finally you have a real video, and all you guys can do is whine and whine and whine.

Why dont YOU post a better torrent? "
,drcat123,2013-06-04T12:24Z,anybody got a screenshot?

,notime4BS,2013-06-04T15:40Z,"It could be worse: at least the camera is stationary and the audio decent enough to make out. I've seen better, and I've seen worse. Thanks for the up, .BONE.!"
,ironymon,2013-06-04T17:37Z,"have nothing else to do, i can ignore the logo, why can't others is beyond me, if the movie is even slightly interesting i'll fully get into it."

,xanat0s,2013-06-05T04:37Z,"Want to know why ppl are bitching? Cuz there are no fucking standards on the scene anymore. You've got retards that up shit like this, then you've got other retards like @MehtaRahulC and @iamlaze defending the garbage. But if someone up'd the film in 100x50 resolution and 64k audio, bet you wouldn't here peep from those fucktards. So to @MehtaRahulC and @iamlaze in particular, shut your cunts and go choke on a corporate cock."
,DigitalCr0w,2013-06-05T06:38Z,Will post honest rating after d/ling regardless of watermarks and such after checking...
,wanderinpilgrim,2013-06-05T07:02Z,"Anyone giving this a positive spin is either the uploader or someone pitching for the uploader....or....you are pathetically limited in your ability to adequately discern a good cam from a bad cam.

Go to the Cinema for this one folks or at least wait for a decent cam!

And uploader...you and your ""pirate"" logo covering up part of this hideous cam are giving the 'Pirate"" in Pirate Bay the shiver me willies.
Stick to filming your dog in the backyard.....i degress:

 Video 3  Audio 2  and that's generous"
,DigitalCr0w,2013-06-05T07:04Z,"I recommend waiting for a better copy, V/A quality or poor at best, barely watchable and hard to understand.  v2/a3
And this has nothing to do with the watermark in the movie, just very poor quality!"
,baybreeze,2013-06-05T09:49Z,"Not only was the camera a potato, but they have the audacity to write all over the screen for you to buy some stupid novel from Amazon,while there's a stupid pirate logo in the corner. Luckilly I saw it streaming so I could pass it by only to find the crap posted here on TPB. Get this straight assclowns Real Pirates Have Standards and your not meeting them."
,iamlaze,2013-06-05T16:30Z,"@xanat0s. You are on crack sir. DON'T BE A HYPOCRITE! lmfao!. I wasn't bitching or taking up for shit. This is TPB. i stated facts, like a water mark thoughout the film, A/V/M. Go to the store and buy some tampons, your puxxy is bleeding all over the place. "
,DreaD151,2013-06-05T16:30Z,First off I only comment when there is a problem.... Here is the problem !. This is not a spam this is a ploy to have people check out the Counterfeit Hope Novel. 2. You dont have to download it or like it is your choice. 3. A4 V4 thanks .BONE its  the first copy out ... all .BONE does is write the torrent for PB and edit the copy HE IS GIVEN more than likely the copy HE WAS GIVEN had this logo already on it if not its his business why its there dont be greedy be happy and support the cause .....
,DreaD151,2013-06-05T16:36Z,@MehtaRahulC hahahah lmao that was really perfectly said I try to make it fuckin clear sometimes to these folks goin on and on about how .BONE and SCENE and all the other folks out there who use their time an skills for FREE for US to ENJOY but all folks can do is whine and bitch and cry and really noone cares if they wanna play Leonard Maltin  on PB or not
,WhyGhtMic,2013-06-06T09:35Z,"Thank you for the great movie. The audio was difficult to hear in some spots, but overall it was very watchable.  
A-7 V-8 (for a cam)
Movie - 10"
,dash34,2013-06-07T00:55Z,please I and many really wanna watch this movie!! please a better quality still camera print or better with good audio plz!!
,IncomePitbull,2013-06-07T09:20Z,"The reason why people are bitching.... is because it is 2013 and we are getting cams from people in 3rd world countries using a 1998 camcorder like it just hit store shelves and is the latest and greatest technology.

For $200 you can get a decent camcorder from Walmart... most people have them already, because they use them for the family.

We DO respect what those do who provide.. but we don't need them if they are going to spit out shit cams like this.

We don't ask for a DVD quality cam... but we know what is completely possible, and shitty cell phone quality cams are just rediculous.

I have seen HD cams that look about 75% DVD quality! (while the audio was good for a cam).. Again, that would be the ""top of the line"" cam.. All we are asking for is ""decent"" or ""average"" cam.. This and some of the others I have seen, fall in the bottom 10%, and are some of the worst cams I have seen.

A cam is a cam, we get that it is a damn cam. We don't care that it's a cam... but if you can't product a respectable cam, and are going to spit out shit cams like this, then don't even bother!

It is a waste of time, a waste of bandwidth, and just 1 more torrent to look over.

If the encoder is so desperate for money, that he has to watermark his videos, then go get a damn job, broke ass!

In 2013, cams like this should not exist. My cellphone could record a better cam!"
,IncomePitbull,2013-06-07T09:23Z,"My cellphone can make a better cam than this.

It is 2013, produce a decent cam, or get out of the scene. You can pick up a decent HD camcorder for about $200. With good cameras being VERY affordable, cams like this should not be happening. If you are too broke to get one, then go get a job. If modern camera's are not available in your country, then move out of your 3rd world country... the rest of the world is 100 years ahead of you..."
,cornelush23,2013-06-07T17:52Z,thanks
,digitalepisode,2013-06-08T01:14Z,Worst piece of shit I've ever seen on TPB and from Bone.  Shockingly bad.  I'd rather watch paint dry.

,bonethugnharmony,2013-06-08T23:31Z,"@IncomePitbull ,  so buy one and record it yourself, fucking pussy  Whine,Whine,Whine.....little baby. Go suck on your mom´s tit. Spend $200, like maybe in a 3rd world country they can´t. And stop complaining. You write a fucking book to bitch, I feel sorry for your boyfriend. Fucking queer, take it in the ass and record it with your $200 Dollar Digital Cam, or better yet...ship one to the needy in the 3rd world and stop complaining asshole. "

,exdous69,2013-06-09T21:19Z,"not a good copy, but it is what it is. and for you people bitching about .BONE. and his logo... you clearly have no fucking clue what you are talking about. .BONE. (the uploader) isnt the one who put the logo in there. not once has he put some shit like that in his files... although, i am VERY surprised that he (.BONE.) would upload such garbage... but whatever, its free. thanks for the effort .Bone.

,Calamakuya,2013-06-13T07:14Z,"For sure... I've never imagined myself saying anything bad about BONE.... until I downloaded this copy.
