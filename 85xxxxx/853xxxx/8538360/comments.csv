,tawoody23,2013-06-06T01:14Z,"Thank you Ez.

I loved this show. Hopefully it will be renewed. If not, this was a decent story and a great 1st season. The in depth story telling, high production quality, epic fight scenes all give this show an 8/10 rating in my book.

If only The Walking Dead could take a lesson."
,Jack0ff,2013-06-09T05:14Z,"@tawoody23 - youre a fuckin idiot. im sooo glad walking dead does NOTHING like this show. the story sucked, the acting was worse, fights scenes were lame and predicable, the sets looked FAKE and so did the actors ...this show needs to take a few lessons from walking dead as to how people would look post apocalypse"
,sharer1064,2013-06-09T23:31Z,Many thanks for all the episodes.
