,Xigor,2013-06-04T06:57Z,What makes this one so special??
,SSJASON,2013-06-04T07:31Z,"The Special Edition of Gunpoint includes:

The Soundtrack: Includes all of the game's noir-inspired spy music in high quality MP3 format.
Developer Commentary: When enabled, you'll find little sprites of Gunpoint's developers on every mission. Talk to us to hear a little about our thinking behind the design (Tom), the art (John), and the music (Ryan).
Caution: shooting a developer while he's talking ends his current commentary track. This kills the developer."
,jrhindo,2013-06-04T17:30Z,"None uploaded the 'exclusive edition'? Contains all this plus loads more of bonus, concept art, artwork, wallpapers and apparently a HUGE amount of music of all the sound works (used or not) made for the game."
,furrymessiah,2013-06-06T00:01Z,Thanks for saying this version is in Russian. Dicks.
,kreeonk33,2013-06-06T16:01Z,Is this in Russian? Or is that guy just a dick?
,WD-i,2013-06-07T02:43Z,"Is this safe to install in the default Steamapps location / does it need to be installed there? 

Or will Steam end up banning my account if I do?"
,peps178,2013-06-08T16:47Z,thanks!
,gphoenix51,2013-06-12T17:40Z,"The Game is not in Russian, it's in English. When you run Setup, it's in Russian till you click the button that says RU, which switches it to English.

The game itself is also not in Russian, dunno if it is if you run the installer that way and I don't plan on finding out since I can't read it.

Game works great, thanks HeroMaster"
