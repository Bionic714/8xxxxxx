ΓÇó Profiles make it easy. SnagIt comes with eleven preset buttons that make screen capture a cinch! Capture a region of your screen, text from a window, the contents of a tall page that scrolls, all the images on a Web page, you get the idea.
ΓÇó Custom suits you. Don't feel limited by the eleven profilesΓÇöcreate your own combinations for nearly unlimited capture possibilites. What's that? You want to set up a keystroke that captures a menu along with the mouse pointer...adds a drop shadow...and sends the image directly to your Wordpress.com blog? Sure, no problem!

You don't need a million confusing options, you need the right tools at the right time. Unlike expensive, complex image editing suites,SnagIt makes everyday screen capture tasks one-click easy.

ΓÇó Say more with pictures+words. Use an arrow to direct attention. Add a text callout to explain clearly. Apply ready-made objects from the menus...and your picture is worth 1,000 more words!
ΓÇó Look like a pro. Make your screenshot pop with a drop shadow. Give it perspective, spotlight an area, or add other nifty effects.
ΓÇó Convey complex ideas simply. Combine multiple images, callouts, shapes, and clip art stamps into a rich and detailed information graphic.
ΓÇó Have fun! Add a speech balloon to that photo of your cat.

Share - send captures where they need to go...instantly!
Yes, you can save your captures in all the commonΓÇöand a few uncommonΓÇöimage formats. But with SnagIt's free output accessories you can do so much more!

Organize - SnagIt keeps track, so you donΓÇÖt have to
ΓÇó Save nothing...save everything. SnagIt stores every capture automatically and keeps the most recent visible. A huge timesaver!
ΓÇó Find your stuff. Whether or not you saved it, find that capture later with the new visual search pane. Remember just one detailΓÇölike the approximate date or the Web site you capturedΓÇöand find your capture instantly.
