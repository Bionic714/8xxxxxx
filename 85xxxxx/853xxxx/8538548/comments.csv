,chris_Roberts,2013-06-04T11:40Z,"Never mind, I figured it out, its the crack file steam_api.ini in Binaries/Win32. Open it and change the letters from ""russian"" to ""english""."
,aznguy212,2013-06-04T11:51Z,"right click ""steam_api.ini"" uncheck read-only and open it, scroll all the way down and change russian to english."
,Killingjokecz,2013-06-04T11:53Z,"!!!HOWTO GET ENGLISH!!!
In the crack there is a file named steam_api.ini, all the way down there is a line that should like like that

Language=english"
,theicephoenix,2013-06-04T13:48Z,"Game does not save after going back to main menu it says new game only. 

However to change it to English simply change the language to English in the steam API file 
here

,rcords,2013-06-05T09:06Z,"Didn't save for me until I used the FLT crack.

Also enemy placement/pressens were a little different, I think the difficulty levels aren't working in this."

,chiooich,2013-06-09T22:24Z,"@DioDevil I can't believe how well I'm playing this. 
Playing on ""Memory Hunter"" difficulty and I don't play hardest on most games. 


This is your strategy. 
I'm guessing, you're having trouble with the part where she has illusions or herself? 
which is like in where she has lost half of her life.

The first time she Clones herself, you literally have to guess which one is real and gain enough focus to activate the the Special skill with the ""?"" icon (lower right) if you press ""q"" 

she will disappear and summon transparent guys, try to gain some health and the moment she shows herself again (hit shift and right click) all the summons will disappear (mostly?)
Wait for her to clone herself and activate special skill (snos?) ""?"" icon.

Land skill-cooldown combos and repeat the process."
,DioDevil,2013-06-10T06:48Z,"@chiooich i have no problem with the boss fight itself at all like i beat her no problem its at the end with the cutscene and u have to press the buttons then u grab her and jump off the edge then u have to button mash to win but the button mash doesnt work at all for me, did it you?"
,BrentC423,2013-06-10T06:54Z,NO @chiooich He is talking about at the very end of this game when you have to do the final sequence to kill madame when both of you are falling you are suppose to repeatingly press A button (if using a 360 controller) to finish her but when you press the A button it never does anything and you fall back into platform I HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM !!!!!
