,Marko1692,2013-06-05T23:48Z,How do I install this? PowerISO won't open any of those files. Can someone help me?
,ngveantat,2013-06-06T05:23Z,"@Marko1692 when u open up the file, there will be a bunch of files in there. look at the very first one which says flt-reme.001
Ok what u do is open that file with winrar or any extraction program u hav. then it will open up a win rar window that has th iso in it. mount that iso and install.
If you're still unclear, just youtube it. type in ""how to install Remember me FLT"""

,MikeO89,2013-06-07T01:52Z,"I'll answer my own question. No it does not install ""Rember.exe"" as Extremezone's did. Seems the ""setup.exe"" has been tampered with in Extremezone's Release."
