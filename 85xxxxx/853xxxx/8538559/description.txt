Game information
=================

Neo-Paris. 2084

Personal memories can now be digitised, bought, sold and traded. The  last
remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what  appears  to
be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the
beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted  this
surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can
provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society  to  just  a
handful of people

Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where  players  take  on  the
role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into
people's minds and steal or even alter their  memories.  The  authorities,
fearful of her knowledge and capabilities arrested  Nilin  and  wiped  her
memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to
recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search  for
her past leads to her being hunted by the very people  that  created  this
surveillance society
