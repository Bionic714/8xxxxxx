that ladies & gents is what we call an improvement.

in the hopes of keeping the spam about leechers at a minimum, leechers are people who are downloading & uploading. seeders are done being leechers and continue to upload.

the game was uploaded yesterday, there will be alot of leechers.
alot of leechers means you will download slower.

alot of leechers does NOT mean alot of people are leeching."

- This has the Combo Lab Pack DLC (Street Fighter moves). Just need patience: they became available on right time, a little later on game.

Open _CommonRedist then vcredist. Now you can either do both or just the one, it doesn't really matter which one you go into. Open either 2008 or 2010 and open the x64 and repair, do the same with x86.

After that you should be able to run the game perfectly.

that's very strange then, it could be a few things, one being that you may or may not have a driver that's interfering with your gameplay, or it could be that the games not seeing your driver.
