Hey baby, Little Steven here.

This is a very, very, very exciting week.  It is the official end of winter as we come out of the Underground Garage and into the sunlight.

We are celebrating with some surf music this weekend.

We are celebrating the Rolling Stones coming to America.

We are celebrating James Bond.

Joining us will be the Beatles, the Stones, the Beach Boys, Jan & Dean, the Impressions, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Johnny Rivers, and the Monkees.

Come find out what the Surf Bunnies, Little Walter, and the Monkees have in common.

It's Decoration Day, a.k.a. Memorial Day, this weekend in the world's only Rock n' Roll dance party on the radio.

Let the summer-long party begin.

I'll see you this weekend in the Underground Garage
