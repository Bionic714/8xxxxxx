Chinese food offers you complex and lively flavours: sweet, sour, hot, tangy, piquant and salty. There is a texture contrast between crisp and smooth. The vegetables are always brightly coloured. Keeping these requirements in mind the recipes have been arranged in an orderly manner to achieve the desired results. In order to retain the colour and crunch of vegetables they have to be cut correctly, exposing the maximum surface to help them to cook faster, which keeps them crunchy. There is a special section on techniques for cutting vegetables and information on special equipment, ingredients and sauces used in Chinese cooking. Enjoy the taste of China, all cooked in a simple manner in your own kitchen!
