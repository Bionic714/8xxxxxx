May be the best configuration for such software is to make torrent with ~13000
files inside and keep updating this directory from mirrors. Unfortunately
in this case .torrent file is 1,5 Mb size and TPB refuse to accept it.
So here is one .iso file with packages.

Installation:
  According to this http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-05/msg00211.html,
  packages *desktop-file-utils* and *shared-mime-info* need to be installed,
  otherwise 'cygutils.sh exit code 127' error occurs.

* Mount iso image (for example with http://www.daemon-tools.cc)
* Run '&lt;DISK&gt;:setup-1.7.18-1.exe'
* Choose a download source - 'Install from Local Directory'
* Select local package directory - '&lt;DISK&gt;:packages'
* (Loading setup.ini may take a long time)

Include:
* gcc 4.7.2
* git 1.7.9
* cmake 2.8.9
...
