This is a recording from the June 3rd 2013 YouTube stream of Tomorrow's Harvest by BoC.  As such, the quality is not that great - there is a light ringing and fairly substantial saturation and distortion.  Consider this an FM broadcast-quality showcase of Tomorrow's Harvest for you to get a feel for it so you can place an order for the album if you like it. 

If you complain and demand a CD rip then you are not a true Boards of Canada fan.
