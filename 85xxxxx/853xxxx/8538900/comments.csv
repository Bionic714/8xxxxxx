It looks so much like a ""get rich fast online"" scam! 
First they say the game is really hard, you can get left behind, you need 8 hours a day to stay competitive (all three are utterly false) and then MAGIC we have the solutions for you!
I don't know about the guide itself, but the website was worth a read on its own! XD"
,Cobra6x6,2013-06-04T14:21Z,"I take that back. I didn't read all of it. The size of the website, detailing the contents of the guide, is actually longer than the guide itself. Inside you will get useful advice like : ""Aim before you shoot"" ""Shoot at the critical spots"" ""Shotguns are for close range only!""

Thanks for sharing."
