Then I might have a humourous answer for you!

,iryhousen,2013-06-04T15:19Z,"Jamie is the ""McVitey's"" International Biscuit heir.  He just made up with bitchfighter Lucy Watson, but is dating her sworn enemy, Fit Phoebe.  They're all going to Barcelona together to meet with Spenny next week.  I guess that might be the season finale, since TOWIE has started up again."
[T],GaryBradbury2012,2013-06-04T20:57Z,"Oh! Now I get it! I think?!!
You should be a script writer for TOWIE or MIC or dare I say, your own new soap!! You'd make it funny with just that slightest bit of confrontational drama! "
,kbella181,2013-06-05T07:54Z,Gary you are the man. One day I am going to buy the DVD set and upload it and you will be the first to know.
