    Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle game that lets you rewire its levels to
    trick people. You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his
    clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive
    data.
    To get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main
    gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices
    in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with
    the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a
    lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across
    to make him fall through.
