,genkli,2013-06-04T14:15Z,"I downloaded it.
First of all it says it's v1.0.0.1
So it ain't 1.0.2056.0

Second of all, even though I chose English in the installation. And also for in game text language I chose english, but it still did appear as russian. and I couldn't understand anything

But in the end it works"
,souza02,2013-06-04T14:29Z,"have portuguese subtitles?
thanks "
,Koca114,2013-06-04T14:54Z,"Make sure that steam_api is not ""Read only"" and then change lang to =english. Save. Done :)"
,genkli,2013-06-04T16:52Z,"Thanks,
Changing ""russian"" to ""english"" in LumaEmu.ini indeed did the job.

And in this version the DLC works unlike the limited edition of skidrowcrack

Great file size. fast download. thanks"

,buhala,2013-06-04T18:41Z,"I have a bit of a problem in that the game crashes when I launch it, just after it displays the first text."
,crow47,2013-06-04T19:33Z,"I cant figure out how to change the language. I looked at what the other two people did, but everything I look at says english. Im concerned. Please help?"
,genkli,2013-06-04T19:53Z,"@buhala You have to run the game in administrator mode.

@crow47 There are 3 places where you have to choose english.
1. when you first open the setup, there is a dropdown menu with the choice of ""english""
2. while installing it says ""text language"". again you choose ""english""
3. when installation is complete you change the field ""GameLanguage"" to english in LumaEmu.ini.
But tehere are 2 files LumaEmu.ini. make sure on both that field is english. especially the one in  BinariesWin32"

how to solve Failed to create the D3D9 Device

You need a new pc ..."
,shadowbatx,2013-06-04T22:04Z,"Same problem. Crashes after seeing the first text. Ran as administrator, but still crashes."
,shadowbatx,2013-06-04T22:20Z,"Same problem. Even after running as admin, game still, crashes after a glimpse of the first text."
,genkli,2013-06-04T23:50Z,"Than I don't know for sure what the problem is. Because I had the same problem until i did run it in admin mode.

try these:
- make sure no file is ""read only"" in C:\Program Files (x86)\Remember Me
- if that doesn't help, try to update your graphics card driver.
- if that doesn't work try editing the config files, so that the game doesn't run in full screen. or when the game start immediately try pressing alt+enter. Or try to lower resolution.
- and if that doesn't help either. I don't know. cannot think of another possibility"
,Shirako99,2013-06-05T10:00Z,I remember you HM thanks
,Malcolm90210,2013-06-05T14:33Z,I don't see a point why everybody wants to download this half-ass piece of shit game?!
,Malcolm90210,2013-06-05T14:34Z,This game sucks!
,ashura889,2013-06-05T15:17Z,"crow47
there are 2 files LumaEmu.ini. + steam_api
change them to english"
,genkli,2013-06-05T16:36Z,"@Malcolm90210

Your question is a rhetorical question, and you know it yourself too.

Just because you don't like a game doesn't mean everyone else should dislike it.

As a matter of fact this is the type of games that are my favorite. 3rd person close combat action games. This game also has amazing environments with a lot detail. So STFU and go back to your call of duty"

HOW TO SAVE IN THIS GAME"
,Malcolm90210,2013-06-05T18:45Z,"@genkli Go fuck yourself! I ain't a COD fanboy you fucking douche! I too am a lover of 3rd person action games, but this ain't worthy to be called a game! And everyone knows the makers of this game are CAPCOM and they suck balls just like you!"
,shadowbatx,2013-06-05T20:30Z,"@genkli
It was my graphics driver that was out of date. Works fine now! Thanks!"
,genkli,2013-06-06T00:51Z,"@shadowbatx
You're welcome

,NITGuy,2013-06-06T16:22Z,"I'm getting an MSVCR110.dll missing error.. and if I download and put that, it shows me an MSVCP110.dll missing error and if I put that one also, then I get some 0xc000007 error. I tried installing on two different pcs, both win8 pro 64bit, one with NVIDIA and the other with AMD.. so pls help me out guys!!"

but now I have the issue of the game crashing right after the first texts appears. gotta work on that now. "
,b3spirit,2013-06-06T16:54Z,"Got IT working at last............those of you who are getting ""Failed to create the D3D9 Device"" error and other crashes at launch, can try the following.

-Go to C:UsersYOURLANIDDocumentsMy GamesUnrealEngine3RememberMeGameConfig
-open ""ExampleAdriftGfxConfig""
-if you see the resolution mentioned in this file is way beyond your resolution, correct it to the one  your monitor supports.
-save the file and try launching the game.
