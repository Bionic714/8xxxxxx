,ashsama,2013-06-04T18:40Z,"So true.. was gonna download it and give it a chance - untill I saw Cuba Gooding was in it :D

,CostlyC,2013-06-05T18:25Z,"God, I was going to download until I saw these comments. You guys are harsh"
,Durendal123,2013-06-06T00:16Z,"They may be harsh, but they may be correct. I followed the link off of IMDB for a review and wasn't surprised to see that the critic despised this movie. 

Going to do myself a favor and skip this one"
,starlite2,2013-06-06T02:50Z,"Holy shit... this movie isn't half bad for the budget! Cuba Gooding, Jr, is a monster of a professional! And the director seems to have some chops as well. This movie kicks the crap out of anything from Christian Slater's low-budget catalog!! "
,PhreeSht,2013-06-07T00:43Z,This might be a stupid question but how come theres a dvdrip when movie not even been released?
