About the Game:

Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into peopleΓÇÖs minds and steal or even alter their memories.
The game is set in the year 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. 
In the story, Mega-corporation MEMORIZE has invented a new brain implant called the Sensation Engine (Sensen), which enables roughly 99% of the population to upload and share their actual memories on the net.
Remember Me features exploration, platforming, stealth, and melee combat.
The game introduces the mechanic of 'memory remixing': entering and rearranging a target's memories to manipulate them.
In terms of combat, the game will allow players to create and customize their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four families of fighting moves called Pressens that players can reorganize by creating chains, 
earned through gaining PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time.
The special moves, S-Pressens, are made available to the player through the course of the game: the moves enabling them to do things like stun groups of enemies, 
move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct.....
