,Hippiefur,2013-06-05T17:46Z,"Hollow Tree and TheC2G, I installed Uncle Sheogorath's Really Helpful Tricks and Tips and it seems to be working fine. Just make sure to use the torrent's launcher, and not one from Nexus or anything else."

,chingo8913,2013-06-06T03:32Z,"Excuse my above comment, it's been a ridiculous day and I didn't in-depth read what ""mods"" actually meant -.-"
,hollowtree,2013-06-06T13:12Z,When i start the game the only mod listed in MCM is Enchanced blood texture does  that mean it's the only one that is working?

This is self-hacked and self-assembled '""Legendary Edition""

Thanks but I'll wait a couple days for the real thing"
