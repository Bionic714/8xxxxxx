,MailerDaemon0,2013-06-05T04:11Z,"Maybe Wentworth Miller should stick to acting instead of writing... wait... forget I said that, he should just retire and disappear like his acting career did... lol

A&V: 8/7.5

M: Like I said, retirement should have been preferable to writing this piece of crap.."
