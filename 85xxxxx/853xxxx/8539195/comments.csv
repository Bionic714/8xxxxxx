,nitropower65,2013-06-05T23:39Z,"Thank you very much for these AMC caps mickedee77 ..the old lady wouldn't be able to see this show if it wasn't for you.

Just one thing.... could you do better than 10FPS when encoding?  playback is very choppy at such a low frame rate.
24.97fps is the standard... but I'd be happy with even 20fps."
,mickedee77,2013-06-06T05:02Z,"hi nitropower65, I have got it set at 25fps, but it still records the way it does, I have no idea why. I am constantly looking into how to improve this but haven't been able to work out a solution as yet."
,nitropower65,2013-06-06T19:13Z,"hmmm... that is strange that it would default to 10fps when you set it to 25fps... 
I'm not sure what software you are using to do your capping / converting, but if you let me know, maybe I can find an answer for you."
,mickedee77,2013-06-06T21:44Z,"Sure, I use Replay Video Capture to capture the video and then I edit it with VideoPad Video Editor. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
,nitropower65,2013-06-09T16:02Z,"Sorry for the delay getting back to you mickedee.
I can't find anyone having issues with VideoPad, but I do see some having issue with Replay Video Capture... for many reasons.
It could be as simple as your recording format you are trying (mp4, wmv, etc.) you could try something different and see how that works. 
Or it could be your computer just doesn't have enough power to capture / encode at a  higher rate, so it automatically drops the frame rate. 

Search ""replay video capture frames per second"" and you'll find much info.
Hope that helps. :)"
,mickedee77,2013-06-10T04:15Z,"Thanks for the info. I think it may have been my computer being silly. I checked my record files from last week and most of them are at 25fps, but only a few were at 10fps, so I do apoligize for those ones. I will try to ensure the faster speed from now on"
