Youre a Wonder! "
,binderguy1,2013-06-04T15:11Z,"I guess it's true, what they say: You can take the UL-er out of TPB, but you can't take the TPB out of the UL-er!  ;-)

Just can't stay away, can you, STFmaryville?  ;-)

Thanks for the ul!"
,Mothra67,2013-06-04T16:28Z,"Oh man, I read this back in the day when I was a Kid!  Thanks for this UL!  any chance you have the 8 issue release curtis mags did of the Doc Savage Magazine?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T16:30Z,"i download something like this (it was on bolt.cd) and it just feels wrong not to share it. plus, i had to make up for my dumb ass after double-posting the latest issue of game of thrones! ;-P"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T16:33Z,"and by the way, #23 is the semi-infamous ""bruce banner almost gets raped by 2 gay dudes at the ymca"" issue. not kidding!

,bgg1175,2013-06-04T17:42Z,"When they made this Bruces experience wouldve been rape. 
Fast forward to 2013. Now its 2 guys who think Bruce is hot and they want to have sex with him. But Bruce is a homophobe/Fox news fan who turns into the Hulk because hes a bigot and wont have gay sex. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T21:39Z,"today they could certainly claim it never happened, and sue the hulk for damages!  ;-)

oh i dunno, jerry sandusky got his, didn't he? (realize pedophile and consenting gay adults is not an equivalency, but still...)"
,Torrenad000,2013-06-04T21:59Z,"""Umm! You're Soft! And all pearly white--And you've got the cutest little cheeks!""   Wtf? that's banannas lol. "
,Torrenad000,2013-06-04T21:59Z,"Thanks for the upload, the covers are amazing especially for that time."
,BrezNJ,2013-06-04T22:30Z,Thanks for the UL. Haven't read the B&W continuity-implant issues since they came out. Question: do you have the Hulk stories for #3 & 4? The post only has the Bloodstone portions.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T23:56Z,oh i didn't realize that. lol i even looked at those file names and didn't realize that. hopefully i can track them down.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-05T00:34Z,Here are the issues with the missing stories!  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8541375/
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T02:55Z,"...Excellent post, STFM! Issues 1-9 I've been wanting to nab good scans of for some time, as I've been wanting to toy around with colorizing them just for shits and giggles. If I can ever get either scans of the pre-colored pages for Kirby's ""2001"" treasury edition, or a good scan of the printed version that I can just strip the color out of and start from scratch, I really want to do those as well. 

Again, doubleplusgoodfind, sir!"
