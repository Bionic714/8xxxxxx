Sorry, I don't have any e-book collections.
I just ""reposted"" this since the original tracker/torrent portal took down the one from the original uploader."
,typerx123,2013-06-08T03:32Z,strange while downloading this my virus protection blocked this and since there is no keygen i must assume its infected

I don't know what anti-virus you have but I have Comodo Anti-Virus and also Kaspersky Anti-Virus which don't report anything at all. On top of that I submitted some of them to Virus Total online AV scanner which came out with clean results. In case you wish to be more specific about what file and threat was detected as harmful, please comment further. Otherwise you're just making false claims."
,ner0p,2013-06-08T19:08Z,"typerx123 Claimed his anti-virus detected some kind of threat yet didn't give any details whatsoever. I know I have some of the best AV software and none detected anything. Anyway, I went ahead and uploaded the whole content to Virus Total which is an online scanner that scans files using dozens of known anti-virus databases, long story short: NO THREAT WAS DETECTED."
,rika89,2013-06-10T05:09Z,"after i finish download it, i click on open the containing folder n it says : Attention this torrent contains files that may harm your computer.
i hv my own antivirus, i use kaspersky n i scan it n no virus detected but i still hv doubt cause warning like this never happened to any other torrent files ive downloaded so far..so my question is, should i ignore the torrent warning or not?"

That message that uTorrent presents is standard when the folder you're opening contains some specific file types which have the potential to spread malware. uTorrent itself doesn't detect a threat. Some file types that uTorrent warns about are exe, com, bat, vbs, pdf, msi and probably a few others. This functionality has been available for quite some time in uTorrent, just depends on the files included in a torrent."
