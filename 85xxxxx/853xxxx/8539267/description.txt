Trawlermen Series 2
This BAFTA award winning TV series from the BBC returns for its second series and continues to follow the often dangerous lives of trawler fishermen off the coast of Scotland. Each episode focuses on this often hazardous occupation and through very human stories we witness how the fisherman crews survive battling the elements on their quest to bring home the perfect catch.


1)  Part 1 
In episode one skipper Jimmy Buchan takes his prawn trawler Amity south to avoid a ferocious storm and fears for the safety of his crew whilst skipper John Buchan sets off in search for haddock but when his trawler Ocean Venture is caught in a force nine gale his crew risk their lives working in 50-knot winds.

2)  Part 2 
In episode two, Ocean Venture is in the grip of a storm, her nets caught on the seabed, and skipper John Buchan must rely on his first mate Barry Lauder to free them. Skipper Jimmy Buchan takes his trawler Amity to fish in a deep and jagged underwater ravine. His first mate Kevin O'Donnell worries that Jimmy's determination to land a catch of good quality prawns will damage the nets and keep her crew at sea for longer than is safe.

3)  Part 3 
Faced with ominous weather warnings, Sandy Watt must decide whether to brave violent storms or head for the safety of the harbour. Two much larger boats, the trawlers Starlight and Starlight Rays, hunt as a pair. Their skippers and crews must have complete trust in each other's skill and judgement - when casting their nets on perilous seas the trawlers come within a stone's throw of each other. One wrong move could result in catastrophe.

4)  Part 4 
In episode four the newest, biggest boat in the fleet, the Chris Andra, sets off on her maiden voyage. But the hunt for a shoal of migrating mackerel is far from plain sailing for skipper Willie Tait. On the trawler Renown skipper James Buchan is practising a form of fishing dating back almost two hundred years.

5)  Part 5 
In the last episode lifelong friends and skippers, Jimmy Buchan and Sandy Watt, take stock of the human cost of one of the most dangerous occupations known to mankind. As Jimmy's trawler Amity lands a hefty catch of prawns, he comes to terms with his fears for the safety of his own life and those of his crew.
