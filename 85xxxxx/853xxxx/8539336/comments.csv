In simplest terms, an unrated movie simply has not been submitted to the MPAA for rating. 

In the case of a theatrical release, it's usually because the people releasing the film know it will get an NC-17 and would rather release it unrated than get that rating - although most theatres that wouldn't play and NC-17 also wouldn't play an unrated movie.

When it comes to DVDs, unrated generally implies there is something different than the theatrical release. Consumers tend to think an unrated DVD is going to be more explicit - especially with nudity/sexuality or violence, but in reality it just means the movie wasn't resubmitted for rating after the additions were made. Given the choice, I would usually buy the unrated version, but my expectations would be relatively low.

For what it's worth, some theatre industry trade associations and the MPAA are trying to get studios to quit releasing unrated DVDs. While they realize the studios are using it as a marketing tool, they are concerned that it undermines the rating system."
