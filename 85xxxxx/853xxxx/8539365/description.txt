The Solitude Trilogy is a collection of three hour-long radio documentaries produced by Canadian pianist Glenn Gould (1932ΓÇô1982) for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a film collaboration between the CBC and PBS. Gould produced the documentaries as individual works between 1967 and 1977, then collected them under the title Solitude Trilogy, reflecting the theme of "withdrawal from the world" that unites the pieces. They are "as close to an autobiographical statement as [he intended] to get in radio".
