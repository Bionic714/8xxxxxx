It is highly recommended that you have the most up-to-date driver for your video card installed to take advantage of the power of OpenGL which is needed for Perfect Photo Suite.

Thank you very much."

Use the License Manager to activate the app. Select Phone/Email License, status will show Evaluation Mode, copy the Installation ID from the License Manager and paste it into the keygen and click generate, in return the keygen will generate a valid Unlocking Key, copy it and paste it into the License Manager and click Install License and it should now say Product Successful Unlocked!

Definitely Not Working"

I was talking about the ""unlock code"" not the ""license number""."
