could you please do Jack The Giant Slayer 3D? :)"
,Dead_aIready,2013-06-07T02:57Z,"I just bought a 3D tv and I cant figure out how to watch this. Do i basically need to burn this movie or can I just watch it from the file? I tried streaming it from my computer but my tv doesnt have the codecs for mp4 files.

What is the best way to watch these files?

and thanks again yify, Ive loved your torrents in the past but I'm now hoping to bring them to life in 3D!"
,Rickyboy1992,2013-06-07T22:35Z,"No doubt this is a legit 3D movie. all of Yifys movies are great! However, can I watch this movie on my PS3? Because some movies will have some restriction and will disable the audio after about 15-20 minutes into the movie. So help please?"
