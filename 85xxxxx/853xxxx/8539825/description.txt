While Jeet, a partner in a big architect firm, which he inherited from his deceased father-in-law; Raj is a struggling singer in a band. Jeet and Raj was invited to a party of a non-Bengali business client of Jeet, where Raj flirted with the businessman's daughter Inka (Neha Panda). After party, both the friends bought drinks from closed shops and drank in the open. Both of them wished they had each other life. After getting up from sleep, both of them found that their soul has interchanged. Both of the friends were surprised to find themselves in that situation. While both of them tried to be loyal, but found it difficult to live in each other's life. In the meanwhile Raj (in Jeet's body) visited Chandannagar, his home town to meet his parents, which he left years ago to make a career in singing. Even, Jeet (in Raj's body) came to visit his house to see his child. Inka came to stay with Raj (actually Jeet's soul) after she had a fight with her parents. Both the friends tried to manage each other's work. While, Raj gave an interesting solution of using terracotta in bathroom instead of gold plates to the Indonesian clients. Jeet, on the other hand introduced Inka as a lead singer in their band, whose performance was well appreciated. The two friends, decided to get back to each other's life, they repeated the same acts they did on the day they interchanged and were successful in getting back their souls in their own body. The movie ended with Raj going for a trip to Chandannagar to visit his parents.
