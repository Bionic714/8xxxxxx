Fucker."
,P2P4FREE,2013-06-07T00:56Z,Where did you release it?
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-06-07T05:19Z,"A private site. From there it gets spread to a few release blogs and forums.

I don't care you took it but wth is the point of tagging it as HDTV and remuxing lol"
,Marit0,2013-06-07T08:13Z,"Sorry if this is way offtopic. First of all, than you very much MrUnpopular for your release of the Oklahoma documentary, I'm a fan of Tim Samaras research in the field of severe weather and this documentary was dedicated to him. I hope  you read this because if you don't mind, i'd like to make a request to you: can you please release the ""Mile Wide Tornado: Stormchasers Tribute"" because Discovery is not airing it in my country, and i would very much like to watch it. Thanks in advance for your time."
,P2P4FREE,2013-06-07T17:01Z,"When i was fixing audio sync issues it got converted into mkv see my comment here https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=125073&page=320 also changed name to HDTV instead of TVRip as i havent seen any other torrents labeled TVRip. Didnt realize you were the original source, it wasnt uploaded to the TPB so thats why I uploaded it. Heres where i found it http://releasethread.ws/?s=Discovery.Channel.Mile.Wide.Tornado.Oklahoma.Disaster . If anybody owns it its the Discovery Channel ;)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-06-07T17:39Z,"@Marit0 I released it yesterday, Google Discovery.Channel.Mile.Wide.Tornado.Storm.Chasers.Tribute.WS.TVRip.x264-UNPOPULAR"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-06-07T17:40Z,The audio was oos? Seems fine to me on my original encode of it
,Marit0,2013-06-07T21:48Z,"@MrUnpopular
Thank you very much for the Tribute release, I googled it yesterday, trust me, went over the first 10 pages in Google search and still couldn't find it, so I gave up hope. My respect to you and your great contributions  :)"
[T],MrUnpopular,2013-06-07T23:44Z,It's possible you searched it before it got uploaded.
