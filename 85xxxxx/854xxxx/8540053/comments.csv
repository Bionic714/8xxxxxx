[V],baby967,2013-06-05T13:04Z,"Transkod (night  May-03-2013) online presentation of the album. A presentation was in a 128Kbps
Album comes out June 10 2013

,korock,2013-06-05T13:39Z,"@baby967 Well, this is in 320kb/s, it leaked on slsk a day after the youtube broadcast,so I guessed it was ripped from there, but I don't know for sure. Anyway the quality is pretty good, to me at least. :)"
,pizzanice,2013-06-05T18:38Z,"Files can be set to 320 kb/s but that doesn't mean it's playing back at that rate. So I guess you can look at it like the file has a 320 kb/s capacity, yet its just a recording of audio at 128 kb/s. 

So it's likely this is actually 128kb/s. Regardless, the quality is fine to me, and definitely good enough to enjoy the release.

Loving what I'm hearing so far."
,korock,2013-06-08T02:34Z,"@pizzanice Yes, that is true, although I tested these files with EncSpot (it's supposed to give you the actual bitrate, not the one from the tags) and it said that the files are 44100Hz, 320 kb/s,cbr lame 3.68 encoded..I'm still not convinced, but as you pointed out, the quality is more than acceptable."
,octo77,2013-06-08T23:43Z,"When comparing Reach for the Dead with the official 320kbps pre-release download from Bleep, it's safe to say this one is ripped from the stream as the volume is a lot lower and not as clear. Still nice to have until the legit release.  "
