This is actually version 1.1.1.0, hotfix for bugs introduced in 1.1.0.0 is present!"
,smash112,2013-06-04T17:42Z,"OK, so is 1.1.0.0 coming too then? I guess without that I can't install this one. Or does this already contain the older patch?"
,ptlk,2013-06-04T17:51Z,"All released patches are on my acc I used version from around here, patch 1.0.4.0 from my acc, then 1.1.0.0 which turned out to patch Reus exe to 1.1.1.0 and this was actually 1MB hotfix introduced on Steam, GoG patch available here gives you leatest version of the game as of 4th July"
,Cuolt,2013-06-04T18:03Z,"i hate you ptlk, now my game not working, please delete torrent!"
,smash112,2013-06-04T18:39Z,"The game is not broken with this, just no longer cracked. You can fix it, if you download the latest 3DM crack.
Here is how I got it to work:
1. Uninstall the game (keep saves)
2. Reinstall GOG version (don't start the game)
3. Install 1.0.4 patch (don't start the game)
4. Install this patch (don't start the game)
5. Copy crack to game folder, and start the game."
,ptlk,2013-06-04T18:40Z,why would i? it works perfectly
,pringles9,2013-06-04T21:27Z,"Yep, it definitely works perfectly. If not, you're doing it wrong, and I can't see how something this simple can be done wrong. Stop blaming ptlk.

Also, GOG patches always (as far as I know) include all previous patches, so you can apply this to any version."
,nikihunter,2013-06-04T21:33Z,Sorry for the offtopic but is there any chance that you could upload the updated version of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 Gold from GOG because in the bonus materials there is Windows version of the game and nobody want to upload it.
