Mohan Sharma (Tarun Bose) is a workaholic,      
whose life changes dramatically after his       
wife dies upon giving birth to their daughter   
Uma (Sharmila Tagore). He despises the          
daughter by day, and adores her when drunk      
at night. The film is about Uma's coming of     
age and her relationship with a sensitive poet  
Ashok (Dharmendra) who slowly brings her        
out of her shell.
