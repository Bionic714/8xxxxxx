"The Atlantic magazine" has called it the "end of men." For the first time in U.S. history, women form the majority of the workforce, filling more managerial positions than their male counterparts. Today's women are primed to take over the corporate world - if they don't stumble on the way up. Packed with insights from extraordinary women who have climbed the corporate ladder - including McDonald's president Jan Fields, JetBlue cofounder Ann Rhoades, and fashion pioneer Liz Lange - "Who Says It's a Man's World" helps women navigate the rocky path from cubicle to executive suite. This ultra-practical guide offers an ideal "Success Profile" along with the measurable action steps needed to excel in each of five reputation-enhancing areas: personal development, social skills, effectiveness, team building, and leadership. Complete with the latest research on women in the workplace and an eye-opening "promo ta bility" assessment, "Who Says It's a Man's World" provides readers with everything they need to build their own fast-track career plan.
