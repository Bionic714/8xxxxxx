Gary and Martin Kemp are teaming up to present Gangs of Britain,
a brand new series that follows the brothers as they visit different
regions in Britain to explore gang culture both past
and present, exclusively on Crime & Investigation Network.

In each episode, Gary and Martin will visit a specific UK
region where they investigate the stories of one latter-day
and one contemporary gang. Through interviews, archive and
dramatic re-construction, they will discover that blood
line,criminal activity, clothing, religion, nationality,
choice of weapon and prison were just as important to gangs
in Victorian and Edwardian Britain as they are today.

The brothers famously portrayed the Krays in the eponymous
1990 film but Gangs of Britain will be their first piece of
factual television as a duo. In each programme, they
interweave the stories of a modern and a historical gang
from a major UK city. The series kicks off in Glasgow before
visiting Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, London and
Sheffield.

Gary tackles stories from the past, retelling extraordinary
accounts of murder, vice, thievery and extortion from the
criminal gangs that ran Britain from the 19th to mid-20th
Centuries. From the long fringe, silk neckerchief, peaked
hat and wooden clogs of Manchesterâ™s teenage Scuttlers to
the Teddy Boy “Edwardian” look of Londonâ™s Elephant Boys
gang. The series visits the infamous landmarks and interviews
historians and experts to uncover and piece together evidence
and archives that build up a unique and unfamiliar map
of Gangland Britain.

Martin will immerse himself in more contemporary gangs that
still have living members and victims able to recount what
happened in recent years. He will meet the police, experts,
members and ex-members of some of the countyâ™s most notorious
gangs. From the Burger Bar Boys to the Kings of the Old Kent
Road, Gangs of Britain will build up a fascinating picture of
the dark underbelly of the United Kingdom.

Glasgow
Glasgow is a city divided. Cut in half by one lethal weapon
the blade. There are more scarred faces in Glasgow than
anywhere else in Britain and in 2002 the World Health
Organisation designated Glasgow the murder capital of Europe.


Liverpool
Gary and Martin turn the spotlight on Liverpool and its life
blood, the River Mersey. From the very beginning the docks
determined the fortunes of this city. They have also allowed
local criminals to play a part on the international stage,
the most infamous being Curtis Warren, a leading figure in
the Liverpool Mafia in the '90s.


Manchester
A knife attack leaves a teenage gang member fatally wounded
on an Edwardian Manchester street. Around a century later,
in another part of the city, a man is shot dead attending
the wake of his friend – the victim of another gang murder.


Birmingham
In the early part of the 20th century racetracks became a
battleground for gangs across the country. A Birmingham gang
called the Brummagems was top dog and built up a criminal
network extending far beyond their city.



London - East & West
Gary and Martin Kemp turn their attentions to Britainâ™s capital.
London has always had criminals. The biggest city
in Britain is like a magnet to those wanting to make a bob
or two – even if that means taking the law into their
own hands.

Sheffield
In 2008, an illicit message sent from prison ignites a gang
feud in Sheffield and a supposed traitor becomes a marked
man. The gang is called the S3 – named after the postcode
of their area.


Gangs have risen and fallen. Theyâ™ve moved from gambling
into clubs and protection, smuggling and prostitution,
clubs and protection. Today they make millions from
full-scale drug importation. But is there a pattern to
their criminality?
