Daum PotPlayer is a powerful media player developed by Daum for Windows.

PotPlayer is able to play smoothly almost any media file you throw at it without the help of any audio or video codec packs installed on PC. 

 The player provides both internal and external filters with a fully controlled environment in terms of connections to other splitters, decoders, audio/video transform filters and renderers without grappling with the DirectShow merit system. 

 Internal filters are not registered into the system's registry to prevent the operating system from confusing system filters.
