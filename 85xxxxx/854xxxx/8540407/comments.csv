[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-04T20:03Z,"thanks Mothra67! i don't think i've ever read thunder agents. oh and hey, reading his wikipedia page, i do remember my favorite wally wood work, the astonishing tales dr. doom stories from the early 70's. good stuff. i first read them in black and white in Essential Super-Villain Team-Up. i think they're better than in color."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T02:51Z,"...Mothra, you read my mind again! Excellent, and I'll be sharing this for a while as the whole Tower run is in the Pubic Domain. And since John Carbonaro is dead and poisoning the worms, there ain't jack shit he can do about anyone posting these. I just wish he'd kicked the bucket about 20 years earlier so as to not prevent the Agents from making a comeback a long time ago. Dave Singer's revival was excellent, and Carbonaro killed it in the courts out of spite. 

Shhh...can you hear that? It's Carbonaro screaming from the depths of Hell. Wonder if he's sharing a cell with his buddy, Rick Olney?

...But I vengefully digress. Again, excellent find, Mothra. STFM, I recommend you read these, as they really were Wally Wood at his creative zenith. The only downside is that they had Mike Sekowsky doing one of the Lightning backup stories - in which the villain happens to be a self-portrait of Sekowsky himself! - and while the story's good, the art is typical beer-barrel, limp-wristed Sekowsky hack work. Again, the only nadir of the whole run.

...One story I do recommend is ""The Death of Mentor"", which is considered by many comic book historians and critics as one of the top ten stories of the 1960s, as it forshadowed the seriousness of how stories were going to go plot-wise in the next decade or so. Had comics today retained in just one *issue* what one specific series of panels - you'll know which ones when you read them, STFM - contained, then the industry wouldn't be in the shithole it's in today. 

Again, I'll be keeping these online for a while. All hail Mothra!!"
,Mothra67,2013-06-05T06:04Z,"Glad you guys enjoy this UL.  The wally wood stuff I REALLY wanted to post was all the wortk he did for EC, mainly in Weird Science, but alas, I can find it nowhere!!!"
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T06:36Z,"...Yeah, a lot of Wally's EC stuff is hard to come by in the scans. In fact, I've seen more of it behind the glass in the LCS' than I have online. Those who can scan them can't afford them, and those who have them don't want to break the seal and scan them. Catch-22, natch.

...The sad part about Wallys career was that his eyesight was failing in the last couple of years. He kept missing deadlines due to periods where he couldn't focus properly, so nobody worth a frack would give him any reasonable work. He did some self-publishing at the very last to help pay the bills, but most of that turned out to be pr0n - especially where we finally saw the Original ""Sally Forth"" get fucked on panel. Repeatedly. He also skewered a bunch of fairy tales along the way, and that would wind up being his last work. Not his best quality or subject matter, but fans bought it anyway to support Wally in the days before Hero Initiative.

Far too many of our classic artists wind up like this, alas. "
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T06:37Z,"...Oh, and I'll keep this up for at least a week, if not longer. Thanks again, Mothra, for the excellent find!"
,Coconut.Craze,2013-06-05T11:04Z,"Next time , pls rename the files properly , so that they are in a order like issue1 , then issue 2 , then issue 3 and so on.

I grabbed ur frankenstien and doll man.
and to my horror , i found them to be all jumbled up, like issue 5 , then issue 17, then issue 9 etc. 
Now its not our job to set things in order.
When you upload a torrent its your job to see that all files are in order, since it makes easy for us readers to access them."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T11:45Z,"...Bah. If the choice is between having them with the folders not in order, or being an anal-retentive wanker and not having them, I think you know which choice would be made.

That being said, don't like it? Then either fix them yourself and repack the torrent, or kindly frack off and keep your unappreciative whinings to yourself...:P

,Coconut.Craze,2013-06-05T15:07Z,"Hey chinga ping pong or watever or name is . First of all , my message was for Mothra , not for you . So, don't poke ur yellow chinese nose in my matter. If you want attention , go post ur a.s.s fingering pic on the internet or you being drilled by your bf xD

I have the right to say that to mothra , since i have never in my life seen a respectable uploader , upload huge number of files in a messy jumbled up order. . . If it was only two or three files , i wouldn't have complained on the first place.
I download stuffs from uploaders like blackcanary , StfMaryville, Joshua and they all pack everything in a perfect order . They hardly give us downloaders a chance to complaint.

So don't teach me what to do kid. and get the hell outta here."
,Mothra67,2013-06-05T16:31Z,"I did not scan these I got them for STF, and then just uploaded them here, if you're not happy, don't download from me!  Everyone else here seems to respect my work.  If you can find these Ultra rare Golden Age and Silver age books, then maybe you should be uploading yourself instead of complaining"
,Mothra67,2013-06-05T16:32Z,"also I find it funny you would complain when there is NOTHING uploaded under your name!  are you a leecher or what?  like I said,  if you don't like it then don't download my stuff, simple"
,Coconut.Craze,2013-06-05T17:42Z,"@ mothra 
So, you trying to say, that whoever downloads torrents and whoever  post their comments here should be an uploader too?? 
Man, ur damn funny. XD
Why the hell should i upload ? Im not an uploader , im a downloader and i download stuffs to make a collection of stuffs like comics , mp3s , movies etc.
Yeah you can call me a leecher if you want.

Now just bcoz others didn't complained duzn't means i cannot. As i said above, if it were only two or three files in a bad order , i wouldn't have complained. But you uploaded the whole Giga pack in a topsey turvey manner. Now its gonna take me around an hour to fix them.

Sorry if i sound rude to you , but the job of a good uploader is to order the files , then provide reading orders for crossover series etc. 

I know u didn't scan them . Nor do members like STF scans them , but he packs the files in a neat order, which is a sign of a good uploader. and once you start doing that extra bit , it will increase your reputation too. 
Hope you don't take it the other way that im trying to lecture you or something. It was just an advice . 
Your uploads are good . I have grabbed a few like green lantern , which was perfectly ordered , and i thank you for that. "
,bgbilll,2013-06-06T01:25Z,@ at Cocanut.Craze You are nothing more than a frigging' ungrateful dweeb. oooooooooooooo wow a whole hour of your life to rearrange. You're not that busy ya idiot. I already had these issues from years  ago. I don't even remember if I had to resort them or not. Get to work and quit er whining. Ya get something for free and ya bitch about it not being the way you want it to be. Grow up punk!
,Mothra67,2013-06-06T06:58Z,"Ignoring the negativity coming from those who take and not contribute, I have FINALLY Tracked down the EC weird Science/Fantasy books I was looking for in digital form and have them ordered.  should arrive in a few days, then I will have them up here for all to enjoy.  Stay tuned!  ;)

Also, still not finished with my Project superpowers compiling, so expect more obscure golden age comics with heroes Alex Ross revived as well!"
,Coconut.Craze,2013-06-06T10:38Z,"Here comes another attention seeking blob aka bill ;D
Me Ungrateful ?? huh .. you sure in a mood to fight blobby boy. Can't you see i thanked him above for the green lantern upload. 
And besides, people who puts their lazy bum 24hours infront of the Pc can surely contribute loadsa stuffs & grab at the same time.

Just bcoz he's upping all these for free duzn't means he's God or something . We all upload for others at some point in our lives. And i too contributed few months ago when i was free , but not here , but in some other forums xD 
(and they were animes and mangas & Not Your comics Mr.Mothman)

So keep iggying my negative comments Mr.Mothman , since ppl like you will never accept their own mistakes and ppl like you can't even take an advice from one of his fans. 

... After all you're uploading comics for us downloaders. Its those downloaders that leeches ur files and makes you famous and in the end u can't even take an advice from them. What a shame !! "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T16:20Z,"Coconut.Craze, to my horror, i found your sense of entitlement to be all jumbled up with what you really deserve, which isn't very fucking much at all.

what you are getting is free.
what you can do is rename the files whichever way you like.
what you could do if that's too much trouble is GO SCREW A GOAT!

**what you must do if you criticize any uploader is LEAVE MY NAME OUT OF IT!**

and lay off ChingaTuu, lol. ""his yellow chinese nose"" by itself is worth more than you are."
,new52,2013-06-06T16:28Z,"I enjoyed Nick Spencer's recent series so I'm looking forward to reading the original. Thanks for sharing, Mothra67!!"
,Mothra67,2013-06-08T20:50Z,"My final note on this is I am 46 work full time have a wife and a kid, so I do not have the time to do what the guy wants.  People are lucky I post the obscure Golden and silver age stuff i do which 80% of I BOUGHT WITH MY HARD EARNED CASH!!!!!  so any self righteous punk complaining about my files needs not download them, I bought them, I own them, I post them when I can, Like it or lump it"
,Mothra67,2013-06-09T17:16Z,"OK guys, I can no longer seed this, my share ratio is well over 20, so it's up to you DLer's to keep it going"
