Can you please upload this 2 books . It will be of great help .

1) Discovering statistics using sas .
2) Discovering statistics using R .

The first one is available in one or two file sharing sites but they are limiting the downloading speed and they don't support resume. The file being big, I can't download it even after lot of efforts .

Please help me."
