O’Neill’s told it’s an investigation of Hanssen’s sexual habits. Within weeks, the crusty Hanssen, a devout Catholic, has warmed to O’Neill, who grows to respect Hanssen. O’Neill’s wife resents Hanssen’s intrusiveness; the personal and professional stakes get higher. How they catch Hanssen and why he spies become the film’s story.
