This is a simple compilation of the Crossed Badlands series up till today. I renamed some of the original scans to make it more ocd-friendly. That said, i did not scan those myself and hereby wish to thank those who did. Hope you enjoy it as much as i did, and if you do, maybe go to a store and buy the original print version.
