,Krackpiep,2013-06-05T01:11Z,What is this? does it work? is it legit O.o
,gaditas007,2013-06-05T01:36Z,Downloading! 
,Gladiolewf,2013-06-05T02:06Z,"I'm 99% sure it's fake.
There is only a handful of testers that have access to ""pre alpha"" and even if it were legit, you still can't play since the game is client-server.
Waste of time downloading."
,ronnycordova,2013-06-05T03:53Z,"@Gladiolewf
Go on and keep talking out of your ass- what do I have to gain by wasting my bandwidth (160GB since lunch) to seed a fake torrent?"
,cmoyano,2013-06-05T04:31Z,"its real you morons, already downloaded it, its not like you can play mp or antyhing but at least you can see what the game is like without it being a mod and not realying on armas shitty unptmized engine.  so yes, you can try it, its legit."
,bbshaker,2013-06-05T05:32Z,this works fine all i did was extract rar 1 and 50 read the read me and played although it glitchy and i cant seem to save and always start with random gear sometimes no gear at all some times with alicepack and ak74 or whatever we will see if this gets updated cause if what the game really looks like it would suck 
,BluntzNzigzags,2013-06-05T05:53Z,its real? oh my bad. Good looking on this.
,bbshaker,2013-06-05T16:47Z,ok so i tried it again today and i must have done something wrong the game works but even when i run up to deadheads they cant even hurt me should i unzip all the files can you give a better instruction 
,ksiadzpenetrator,2013-06-05T17:38Z,any ideas how to spawn items/veh?
,dash006,2013-06-05T17:49Z,"probably legit, heres some video footage

,manny68,2013-06-05T19:38Z,I'm sure this is legit. It is certainly better than the 50 file download from some forums.
,hollisb,2013-06-05T20:52Z,"This actually is legit, it's not really worth it though, yea it looks nice and the controls aren't weird...but the game has memory problems, I'm getting a lot of stuttering and super slow loading times. It's really, really buggy."
,ronnycordova,2013-06-06T00:01Z,">pre-alpha of a game based on the Arma 3 pre-alpha engine
How did you guys expect it to run other than terrible?"
,dash006,2013-06-06T01:58Z,"playing this is like watching a movie that is being streamed via a tin foil antenna. I expect the standalone to be a fail, the game engine, animations, in general is terrible. This game would have better luck selling copies if hired a team to make a new engine for this game. one that can actually swing a golfclub or have any sort of melee interaction. The WARZ is 1000x better than this crap. I'm going to put my money into state of decay."
,g0hg0h,2013-06-06T03:54Z,"it workZ, but other than just wandering around the new buldings, there isn't much to 'play' with... i could not open/close doors or pick up equipment, but i did see loot spawns(similar to video updates in the past)   read/heard somewhere that this particular alpha is maybe 2 months old.  

either way, it's an interesting look at a game in progress... if ya can't wait for E3 reveal, then this is the next best thing, otherwise most people will be unimpressed and are better served playing the dayz mod till something else shows up."
,Neked,2013-06-06T10:46Z,"It works but its supposed to be about 10 versions behind what is released currently.
Cant we just patch this with the latest version?"
,Yahoo86PL,2013-06-06T11:05Z,"ok this is real DayZ Standalone but first:

1.Extract files 1-49 (this is game)
2.Extract file 50 crack (ESET show fu*king malware)(off your antivirus)
3.Play (run DayZ.exe)

Loading time - is terible (ssd drive +/- 1 minute).
I explore Cherno but not find zombies.
Graphic - is little ,only little better (this same first speedtree generation ,maeby alpha hmm).
Inventory - Damage of word ,Optimization also (use only CPU).

This same Real Virtuality sh*ty engine remember ofp:CWC ,simulation no...
simulation of archaic errors,...YES.
 have better EGO engine (dirt3 ,ofp:DR/RR ...) 

2 year waiting for what ,for fu****alpha sh*t ,full game when 5 years ?-
no thanks -loss time and money.

When it will ""7 Days to Die"" and ""State of Decay"" DayZ Standalone Sh*t will be dead.
PS: DayZ MOD is better and WarZ is ok (but playing with people not using fuc*** hacks)"
,g0hg0h,2013-06-06T17:24Z,"2 years?!  to my knowledge DayZ mod has only be around since april 2012 or thereabouts... 

more alpha gameplay, noticed z spawn in with me initially, but after wandering thru cherno there weren't any until i headed towards balota...  i just keep reminding myself this is an alpha and options exist if i am unhappy with quality or delivery date.

thanks for sharing ronny"
,Shoobox,2013-06-06T18:25Z,"this is legit and remember people

THIS IS PRE ALPHA ITS GOING TO BE BUGGY AS HELL!!!!!"
,Shoobox,2013-06-06T18:27Z,"@g0hg0h
PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH
DayZ didn't get attention untill 2011 -2012 because of the crappy WarZ game that runs on war inc engine.

DayZ has been around alot longer than 2012"
,g0hg0h,2013-06-07T04:24Z,"@shoeonhead

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DayZ_%28mod%29

believe some random twat or wiki  hmm... that's my 'research' pal

maybe you have some research to back up your claim?   and i remember it predating warz by a few months easy.

thanks again ronny! :P"
,Shoobox,2013-06-07T06:24Z,"@@g0hg0h
Yawn wiki is created by people who pass on the information.
""do your research"" lmao
the creators didn't give the info to wiki, 
wiki is created by a fan base, it is not always true."
,wzzauw,2013-06-08T14:09Z,Guys this works online ? ASWER PLZZ 
,wzzauw,2013-06-08T14:13Z,Works Multiplayers?
,Shoobox,2013-06-08T16:14Z,"@wzzauw

,chesco1414,2013-06-13T03:04Z,"Hey, can someone help me, the steam api file keeps deleting itself? I downloaded twice and kept trying and it would keep deleting from the folder why? "
,Hudaphuq,2013-06-13T12:15Z,"@Shoobox:
You're an idiot. WarZ was created as a way to knock DayZ off it's high-horse. Where the fuck do you get that DayZ didn't get attention because of WarZ? For a long time people thought WarZ was vaporware, which actually caused DayZ to flourish. Then once WarZ actually launched people were so horridly disgusted by how little effort went into it. It's almost an exact clone of War Inc- down to character and weapon models, sound effects, and just about everything else... they claimed they created it from scratch, but really all WarZ is is a War Inc mod cleverly disguised as a new game. They even went so far as to create a subsidiary company to try to obscure this fact, but those of us in the know can see right through their smoke and mirrors.

So why don't YOU do your research before spewing uninformed bullshit?"
,Shoobox,2013-06-14T02:47Z,"@Hudaphuq
your the bigger idiot DayZ was created by dean rocket because he wanted to play a zombie style game with his friends
I know my facts thank you for proving what a moron you are!!!

No more replies to Hudaphuq due to stupidity!!!

Since you can't read what i said was,
""DayZ didn't get attention untill""

never say it didn't get attention
please learn to think before you type before trying to correct someone moron.
we all know faggy warz is a modded version of war inc.
thank you please come again!!"
