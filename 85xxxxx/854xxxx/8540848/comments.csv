Nothing wrong with my Eng subs. I checked them for errors and time-stamps slightly improved, see images below for examples:
(4:37:900 & 5:43:600 my lines got longer times).
Non-English native folks will find your subs more difficult to follow.
Also there are some wrong characters in your subs, for instance the first line yours says 
""Fee-ï¬-fo-fum"" instead of ""Fee-ﬁ-fo-fum"".
My subs also got the name of the speaker colored (from SDH) as shown in this pic:  http://i.imgbox.com/abwG0bxg.png
