Notes:

Video:
Ok this video has no flicker.
Did get rid of them line that was in the video, that showed on actor faces.
Cleaned it up and stuff. No need to boar u with all that stuff.


Audio:
Used CM8 audio, which I think was MILL, thanks to both.
Cleaned it up a bit more.

MOVIE IS VERY WATCHABLE.
