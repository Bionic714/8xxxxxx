Banger Boys
Fasten your seatbelts, put on your safety helmet and get ready for the biggest of big bangs as Banger Boys crash on to your TV screens. Banger Boys has spectacular car stunts and tons of dramas as the Dreamers team, led by champion racer Steve Anscombe (aka Cecil) transform cast-off scrap cars into highly tuned mean racing machines. Once the old wrecks have been rebuilt and given a new lease of life they head for the start line. Then it's full on the accelerator as the banger cars enjoy their magnificent moment in the spotlight on a high speed racetrack. Banger Boys follows the Dreamers team as they track down, build, race and smash up cars, as well as exploring the bond that keeps this tightly knit family of racers and engineers together.


1)  Part 1 
It's a trip down memory lane for Steve to an event that he holds close to his heart, as he turns a 1960's Wolsey in to a Banger racing dream machine and races it at a race originally launched in his honour when he was given a devastating cancer diagnosis. Back at base camp a logistical headache blows up with a race against time to source dozens of cars for a TV action stunt job in which the cars have to explode in flames and an attempt to chill out with a game of golf has hilarious consequences. But it's soon back to work and a drive to Foxhall Stadium in Ipswich where former champions Steve and Mark compete in a ramp rollover contest, in which cars are launched at high speed from a ramp and are judged on how many rolls they achieve and the distance they travel.
