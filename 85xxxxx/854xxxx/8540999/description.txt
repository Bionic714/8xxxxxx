πÇÇπÇÇThe film is about life and love in modern urban Russia. A few young inhabitants of St.Petersburg - quick-witted and handsome designer Misha, vocabulary-challenged architect Alya, and dependable ex-airborne Oleg - start a business decorating interiors, while sharing a characteristically Piter semi-squat. Misha begins dating their customer Tata, a charming and eccentric woman who at first appears to be the pampered mistress of a wealthy man. From there, a romantic story unfolds that bears resemblance to Remarque's 'Three Comrades', where friendship, humor, love and suffering create a vivid chemistry. All the characters are distinct and for the most part likable each in their own right (except they booze all the time!). The movie presents a view on society and volatile life of young people in one of Russia's most fabulous cities. ---- 21mhz from Moscow, Russia
