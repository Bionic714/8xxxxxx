,NumbedChaos,2013-06-05T01:40Z,Why is this 7.3GB when the PC version is 52 MEGABYTES ? I know it's not the same & I don't doubt Stif's Releases but can someone explain why this much difference exists ? Also will this work with SoftModded X360 ? Thanks.
,oviedogators,2013-06-05T02:09Z,seed please!
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-05T02:10Z,"Because it's a disc release, and valid disc iso's have a minimum size, regardless of content.

This is one case where it would have been better if this had been uploaded as a multi-part compressed archive. A lot less to download, though the extracted iso would still be 7.3 gigs. "

,CPx1989,2013-06-09T18:49Z,"This is an official xbox 360 game it just had to meet disc requirements so yes it is xgd2 and 7.3gb but most of the data on the disc is filler space thus why do you think most xbla games arent released on disc...because it is a waste of good discs, not saying xbla games are bad, but they dont need to fill a whole dual layer disc...point: microsoft needs to work on their encryption and compatibility with less expensive discs"
,JaaaRossi,2013-06-09T19:27Z,Thanks man works great on lt3 and its region free
,ClipperCigars,2013-06-14T00:03Z,"@CPx1989, nope. Bulk manufactured discs are pressed and sealed in acrylic. BluRay, DLDVD, DVD, CD's. All use the same process and same equipment. Doesn't matter if it's 1 byte or 50 gigs, time, cost and effort are the same. Literally just PENNIES per disc. It is not the same as recordable consumer media which is completely different in every way.

The reason you don't see much XBLA on disc is for other reasons. First, it hurts XBLA since you don't have to use it. Second, unless a game is really popular, sales will be limited because of the extra costs involved in dealing with a physical product vs a virtual one over XBLA. Not disc cost, but packaging costs, logistical costs, delivery costs. Not to mention that most XBLA games are crap that aren't worth the points, much less owning a physical copy.

That you need to use a DLDVD to burn a pirated copy is only an issue & concern to pirates and I'm sure MS doesn't care one bit about your disc waste. It's honestly an invalid complaint on the whole anyways. You're getting the ISO for free, not paying the $20 for it. Blank DLDVD Verbatims only cost $1.25 and it only takes 40 minutes to burn. So no one has anything to complain about.

Also, FYI, most DLC discs barely use the disc. 10-20% at most. Even many of the full blown x360 games themselves use less than 50% of the disc. Example, Skyrim only uses 46%. 

Also also, even the original Xbox used DLDVD for everything. Only reason you could use CD's and DVD's (DVD mech permitting) was because the hacked firmwares removed the restriction. Early hacked firmware for the X360 also removed that restriction and allowed CD's/DVD's when the content fit. You can blame C4E for catering to the whiny XBL fanboys that demanded to be able to their pirated games online that we have to burn everything to DLDVD. Had the XBL fanboy assholes just bought a second X360 and the games they wanted to play, leaving the hacked/piracy shit for offline use only (just like they all did for the original Xbox without any complaints), we wouldn't be where we are now, and could still use the older firmware that allowed CD's and DVD's.
