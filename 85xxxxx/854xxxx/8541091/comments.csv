,jmc302005,2013-06-10T16:07Z,I agree. This show could have been so much more. Think of Medium. That show was great IMHO.

I wanted to ask a question How do I get a skull next to my name? I don't have a lot of torrents but what I do upload is always the best and tends to be a rare or harder to find torrent."
,jmc302005,2013-06-10T16:16Z,BTW if you guys are commenting I am sorry if I don't respond. I can't see all the comments for some reason. It shows 6 comments and I can only see thetorrentlord's and mine.
