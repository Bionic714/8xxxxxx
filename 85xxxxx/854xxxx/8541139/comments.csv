[V],thetorrentlord,2013-06-05T01:16Z,I have found a different uploader at a site I visit sometimes and am checking to see  if it is being seeded . It was uploaded on 4-18-2013 indicating all episodes are 720p.  Will let you know after I give it sufficient time to see if it is real or fake
[V],thetorrentlord,2013-06-05T01:36Z,Please ignore my earlier comment as I am pretty sure it is the same poster as the one here only it was uploaded on 4-9-2013  by a registered user at the site. It appears with exactly the same info in the descriptions and the file info is the same. It appears to be seeding OK there. When I tried to upload their torrent it said it was already loaded as I had loaded the one from here first. So to me that means it is the same torrent at both sites.
