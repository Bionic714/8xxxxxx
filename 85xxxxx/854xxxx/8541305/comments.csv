,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T03:00Z,"...Well, *I* can't find it posted anywhere else, so howabout either a) leaving it alone, especially if b) you're not going to be arsed to post a valid, already posted link?

If your comment is directed at me, try typing something that makes the slightest bit of sense.

If not.....try making some sense anyway."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-05T11:51Z,"...It wasn't directed at you, which is why it probably didn't make sense to you. On the other hand, it *did* address your inability to download this file, a problem I happen to share with you.

Trust me, if I were bitchslapping you, *you'd* know it. This wasn't such a case..."

My apologies, my frustration is showing with these people that upload something, and then disappear.  It's happening more frequently lately.  And of course, the uploader fails to address any complaints."
