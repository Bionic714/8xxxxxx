Crossing The Color Line (1997) [DVDRip]

In a side of the business that tends to play up the stereotype in its most offensive form, director Colbert offers thoughtful insights on interracial sex that replace the racist animus with a healthier emphasis on human sexuality, hinting at the benign excitement of physical differences. The sex, fortunately, does not suffer from this refreshingly intelligent approach.
Each performer speaks to the camera about black-white sex and its treatment in the industry. Sean Michaels issues a cautionary word about racial understanding, Christi Lake discusses the antecedents of today's bigotry, Naomi Wolfe and Nyrobi Knight discuss differences in treatment, and Jake Steed and Sharon Kane discuss the eternal topic of size, along with other observations.
Make no mistake: While the tone of the video is enlightened, the sex remains appropriately raunchy. The camera gets right in there for the cloeseups and cocksucking. There's enough anal and cowgirl and mish and b.j.s and reverse cowgirls and sloppy facials to enrage any Grand Dragon. And please a lot of consumers.
Interesting commentary by the performers about racism within the adult industry before each scene.
