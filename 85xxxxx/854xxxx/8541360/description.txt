 No rest for the creative mind of MaRLo. The last drop of "BOOM" has yet to sound, but his new one is already hammered by the big jocks.
 Premiered on Armin's A State of Trance show and indulging many, is the stunning "Always Be Around" feat. Sarah Swagger. Being able to perform magic on both instrumental as well as vocal tracks is a rare gift. In the case of Australia's Marlo Hoogstraten, it's an easy one though. He's done both instrumental beasts, such as "Lightning", "Megalodon" and "Jaguar", and vocal beauties - "The Island", "Just Breathe" - alike. Equally big and ready for impact, is his latest offer on the A State of Trance label.
