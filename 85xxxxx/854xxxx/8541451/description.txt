Eye Candy 5: Impact, is a collection of ten Photoshop filters which create chrome, brushed metal, glass, bevels, shadows, reflections and more. Impact includes three all-new filters. Backlight projects dramatic light beam and spotlight effects. Brushed Metal simulates textured metal surfaces such as brushed aluminum and polished brass. Extrude gives 2D objects a classic 3-D look, adding thickness and perspective.
In addition, Impact refines seven classic effects  that made Eye Candy famous. Embossing effects now include surface textures and more bevel shapes. Gel, glass, chrome and liquid metal effects now showcase a wide variety of vibrant reflections. 

Impact includes over 200 presets for frequently used effects; you can find the perfect effect quickly. The improved settings management system makes it easy to browse, share and collect new settings. 

Impact also works with 16-bit images. Color transitions are smoother, with less banding. Print documents reproduce colors more accurately.
