Yahaan is a Hindi movie made by Shoojit Sircar in 2005 and it stars Jimmy Shergill, Minissha Lamba and Yashpal Sharma. This film is a love story set in Kashmir.

This film has one of the most beautiful sountracks of recent times. Music Composer Shantanu Moitra with the help of Lyricist Gulzar has done some special magic in this album. Though despite such a special musical score this album could never achieve what it truly deserved.
