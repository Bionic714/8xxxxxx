,NizzeHulth,2013-06-06T13:05Z,Is this the same as the famous author Stieg Larsson's book The Girl with the Dragon Tatto???
,gabo2,2013-06-06T13:16Z,In disc 7 every file is duplicated
,LD1ne,2013-06-07T17:36Z,@gabo2 at which point is disc 5 damaged? i'm currently going through the files and not seeing any issue. sorry about disc 7 dupes i didn't notice that when i uploaded this one
,gabo2,2013-06-07T22:57Z,"Right from the first file and on in disc 5. It seems to be a scratchy disc, the playback is uneven and there are cracks all over in the sound. I'm sorry for it, the quality beside that is awesome and I've been searching for a qaulity version of this book for a long time. But thank you anyway."
,LD1ne,2013-06-07T23:25Z,oh man thats weird i'm listening to it to and i'm not getting any of that 
,LD1ne,2013-06-07T23:29Z,oh damn now i hear it god i don't know why it worked on the cd but not on the file. I guess i could try to rerip it and upload a new torrent of disc 5 if you'd like i dunno if thats again TPB guidelines or not though.
,gabo2,2013-06-08T00:10Z,"If you could rerip disc 5, that would be magnificent (maybe the second rip won't be flawed). You can upload only the rip from disc 5 titled as a fix for this torrent (maybe with link to here), I think it won't  cause any misunderstanding.
And I am very, very grateful to you for bothering with this."
,LD1ne,2013-06-08T01:17Z,"Ok well here is Disc 5 in a new torrent sorry about that one derp on me

,gabo2,2013-06-08T02:13Z,"Thank you very much, it worked, the cracking is gone. I know it's not much, but I for one am very happy for this book in such quality."
