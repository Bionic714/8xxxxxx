Plot: Widower Gill Callahan retired from the fire department after a tragedy. Helped out by some mates, he starts a diner, offering simple food to their taste. The matching music is too much for the elitist taste of his neighbor, Sara Westbrook, who just started a French restaurant and aspires a refined reputation utterly clashing with the working class neighborhood, leading to a prank war. Gill’s daughter Hannah befriends Sara and ends up acting as matchmaker, helped by fate in what seems tragedy.
