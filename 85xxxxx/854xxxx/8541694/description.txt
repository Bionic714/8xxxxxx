Chances are, if you live outside of places like Boston and New York City, you probably donΓÇÖt know the name Bridget Kearney. Chances are, if the world suddenly becomes a fair and just place, you soon will. The multitalented bassist/songwriter has garnered a great deal of acclaim ΓÇô she won the John Lennon Songwriting contest in 2006 for her compositions ΓÇ£Sometimes When IΓÇÖm DrunkΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£YouΓÇÖre Wearing My Favorite ShirtΓÇ¥ ΓÇô and is known as being a bit of a multi-tasker, as a member of bands such as Cuddle Magic, the Xylopholks (a group that plays 1920s-style ragtime music while dressed up in furry animal costumes) and a little Boston-based jazz-folk outfit called Lake Street Dive, whose third eponymous album released last year earned a rave review from myself, and her latest ongoing project, the bluegrass-rich Joy Kills Sorrow. It might be unseemly to highlight the accomplishments of the current Brooklynite, for a band is merely as great as the combined effort of all of its individual members. However, seeing that Kearney has either written or co-written all of the 11 songs on Joy Kills SorrowΓÇÖs latest release, This Unknown Science, a lot of the success rests squarely on her shoulders. Given the material presented on This Unknown ScienceΓÇömusic that is delightfully toe-tapping, shifting from the triumphant to the downtroddenΓÇöand the aforementioned Lake Street Dive album, it seems apt to say that Kearney is a major talent who, despite being on the small folk label Signature Sounds, is ripe for discovery by the masses. Her songs swoon, brood, and have all of the rich majesty of someone who is clearly wise beyond her years.
