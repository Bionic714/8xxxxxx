Why is dinner with friends often more laughter filled and less fraught than a meal with family? Although some say itΓÇÖs because we choose our friends, itΓÇÖs also because we expect less of them than we do of relatives. While weΓÇÖre busy scrutinizing our romantic relationships and family dramas, our friends are quietly but strongly influencing everything from the articles we read to our weight fluctuations, from our sex lives to our overall happiness levels.
