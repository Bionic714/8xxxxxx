For the follow up to their 2010 White Hat, Chris Senseney and Stefanie Drootin-Senseney, the husband and wife duo known as Big Harp, had two choices: pursue the rough and rural acoustic edges of their studio debut or delve further into the more raw, electric charge that accompanied their live shows. Chain Letters, the pair's January 22 album on Saddle Creek, clearly indicates they went with Option B. "We were sitting around in a bedroom playing really loud with no drums, just kind of trusting that it was going to make sense once we put it all together" says Chris. "Hopefully we landed closer to mid-'70's Iggy Pop than Leonard Cohen this time." The Senseney's may not have fully achieved their dream sound of "Cohen fronting The Pixies" -- the mellow folk heart of songs like "Bar All The Doors" surfaces now and then -- but the freewheeling Chain Letters is shot through with grit and tension, Stefanie's prominent fuzz bass lines and Chris' loose-limbed baritone driving tracks like the ragged, wall-of-sound epic "You Can't Save 'em All".
