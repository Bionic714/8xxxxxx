ItΓÇÖs easy to think of Eleanor Friedberger as just the primary singer of the Fiery Furnaces. However, her songwriting skills were on display even on GallowsbirdΓÇÖs Bark, where her song ΓÇ£Bright Blue TieΓÇ¥ was one of the lower-key standouts among the albumΓÇÖs musical sleights of hand. ItΓÇÖs not surprising, then, that Friedberger's solo debut Last Summer recalls the bandΓÇÖs first album and expands on that songΓÇÖs lilting melody and wryly detailed lyrics. A few tracks feel like they were crowded out of the Furnaces' brimming catalog, particularly ΓÇ£Inn of the Seventh Ray,ΓÇ¥ which boasts some jaunty pianos and travelog lyrics that are decidedly Fiery, and ΓÇ£Heaven,ΓÇ¥ which makes Friedberger's knack for pop melodies literal by sounding like a ΓÇÿ70s soda jingle. Meanwhile, the charm that makes the Furnaces' trickier moments ultimately winning shows up in spades on ΓÇ£My MistakesΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£I WonΓÇÖt Fall Apart on You Tonight,ΓÇ¥ perhaps the most accessible songs Friedberger has ever sung. Fortunately, though, Last Summer doesnΓÇÖt trace the lines of her work with her brother too closely. Instead, she reveals a softer, more personal approach that melds singer/songwriter intimacy with her innate wit. Her voice caresses lines like ΓÇ£he shaved off his beard/and saw The Girl Who Played with Fire" on the lovely ΓÇ£Scenes from Bensonhurst,ΓÇ¥ and disparages ΓÇ£Glitter Gold YearΓÇ¥ΓÇÖs annus horribilus with a twist: ΓÇ£You said it wouldnΓÇÖt be so bad/But itΓÇÖs worse.ΓÇ¥ Friedberger keeps most of her stories close to home, chronicling everyday New York adventures in ΓÇ£Roosevelt IslandΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£One-Month Marathon,ΓÇ¥ but the instrumentation she surrounds them with is far-flung. ΓÇ£Early EarthquakeΓÇ¥ is a potent reminder of how commanding she is with just a guitar and some percussion behind her, while ΓÇ£OwlΓÇÖs Head ParkΓÇ¥ fuses strings, synths, saxophone, and layers of vocals into something lush, sophisticated, and miles away from FriedbergerΓÇÖs band. While Last Summer has enough ties to her work with the Fiery Furnaces to please fans, it gives Friedberger the time in the spotlight she deserves.
