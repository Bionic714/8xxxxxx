You can try and find a gutsier, harder working, more determined bunch than TorontoΓÇÖs Poor Young Things. But even if you succeed, itΓÇÖs doubtful youΓÇÖll also find one as clearly positioned for greatness.

Just two years after collectively relocating from Thunder Bay, the pop-rock quintet has issued a massive, sweat-soaked, insanely confident debut, The Heart. The Head. The End. Not only that, theyΓÇÖve picked up a record deal, marquee management, a Sirius XM Emerging Artist of the Year nomination and a swelling fan base. Few can make something as tough as pursuing a dream look so dang easy.
