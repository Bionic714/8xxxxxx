Do these books discuss why muslims forbid freedom for their people to leave islam, if so they wish, without being killed or going to prison?  Do they discuss why muslims oppress women forcing them to walk around like living tents covering their whole bodies while men don't have to do likewise?  Do they explain why Allah (and his prophet) were so ignorant that they wrote in the Qu'ran that the sun sinks every night in a murky pond?  Otherwise, it's all bullshit like your story above...

,musshi007,2013-06-05T07:39Z,"Islam is a way of life that a muslim chose, its not forced on anyone - I have not come across any Muslim who wants to leave the Islam (if you chose not to follow the path shown by Islam you are not a Muslim - simple enough for such a person).

Islam doesn't parade women like pieces of meat like the west do. Use and throw policy that you use for your women is not freedom its oppression :) good luck to you when someone uses your sister or daughter (try explaining freedom to her)

Obviously you don't know anything written in Quran - so before making comments, have a look - go to a person who knows a little about Quran before commenting."

,ImSoJaded,2013-06-05T15:00Z,"I don't now about your country musshi, but in mine it is the women who decide what to wear - nobody dresses them and parades them. It is called ""freedom"". Look up the concept in the dictionary if you are not familiar with it."

And having a government that forbids women from wearing what religious/cultural clothing they want is just as bad as forcing them to wear it. "
,Basuto9,2013-06-05T20:32Z,"Three actual quotes by the Ayatollah Khomeini, who was an acknowledged expert on Islam:

""A man can marry a girl younger than nine years of age, even if the girl is still a baby being breastfed. A man, however is prohibited from having intercourse with a girl younger than nine, other sexual act such as forplay, rubbing, kissing and sodomy is allowed.""

""A man can have sex with animals such as sheeps, cows, camels and so on. However, he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm. He should not sell the meat to the people in his own village; however, selling the meat to the next door village should be fine.""

""An Islamic regime must be serious in every field,
There are no jokes in Islam.
There is no humour in Islam.
There is no fun in Islam.""

These are not made up - they are verifiable, and they are Islam."
