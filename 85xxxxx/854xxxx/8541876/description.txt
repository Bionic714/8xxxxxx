The complete collection of everything from the Silverwing TV show by Bardel entertainment. I compiled all of the main episodes, along with 3D renderings of the episodes (except for episode 4), all three of the "movies" from the three-disk trilogy set, and a complete "movie" with all of the episodes seamlessly rendered together. Besides this there is also a remastered MP3 of the credits theme, images from the old Silverwing.TV website, character bios from the season set, and also a theme for the season set DVD.

This is a HUGE file, and I would recommend freeing up some space before downloading it (the actual folder with files is about 20GB). You will also need WinRar, or some other decompression program to decompress the downloaded file (I highly recommend WinRar, as it is free and very professional) but it's up to you. Make sure that you check with your country's laws before downloading this file, as it is illegal in many places. 

Finally, please seed, as it makes downloading faster for others.

Thanks in advance, and finally, enjoy!
