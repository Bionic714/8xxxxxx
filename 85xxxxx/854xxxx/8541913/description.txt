An amazon reviewer said, "This is a rare and special book. To write a book like this, an author must be a courageous, independent, and discerning investigator with impeccable journalistic integrity. Unfortunately, these qualities are sorely lacking in today's world of investigative reporting. And, unfortunately, the lack of such qualities leads to terrible misinformation, not only about cannabis but about many other "controversial" issues. This book is meticulously researched and intelligently organized, and its massive research content is masterfully distilled. It is also well written, and that allows the reader to easily understand the scientific foundations for the ultimate research conclusions. If everyone in the U.S. read this book, our entire medical establishment would be turned up-side-down. Or maybe I should say, right-side-up. In one word: Brilliant! "
