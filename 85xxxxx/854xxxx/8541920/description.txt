This is a 24/96 vinyl rip of Frank Sinatra's long forgotten 1970 concept album "Watertown." Critically panned upon release, it sold less than 100,000 copies worldwide, but in recent years has gained a cult following. This needle drop was recorded from an original, factory sealed copy found in a lot of dead stock NOS Vinyl LP's from a record store that closed in the late 70's. This is what a 40 year old unplayed album sounds like.
