*****Disclaimer*****
I am in no way affiliated with the making of these podcasts, they are packaged as .tar.gz's, as so they will require a decompresser if they are downloaded on a M$ or M@c.  They are all in .mp3 format, as they would be from the original site.  And please seed after you are done downloading, it saves bandwidth.
