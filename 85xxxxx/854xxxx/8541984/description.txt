Plot: Based on a more realistic portrayal of “Arthur” than has ever been presented onscreen. The film will focus on the history and politics of the period during which Arthur ruled — when the Roman empire collapsed and skirmishes over power broke out in outlying countries — as opposed to the mystical elements of the tale on which past Arthur films have focused.
