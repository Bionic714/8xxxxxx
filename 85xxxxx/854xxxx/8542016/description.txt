Overview: Detailed network information. ΓÇ£Network Signal Info ProΓÇ¥ provides detailed 

information on your currently used network, regardless whether you are using WiFi or 

a cellular connection. 

Requirements: Android Device OS 2.1 and above 


The Pro version (compared to the free version) has no ads, more widgets, a "mobile-

signal-lost-service" (beta) and a in the background running log function. 

Now with widgets: 1x1, 2x1 and 2x2 in 3 different styles. 

(If you can't find widgets, please copy the app to phone memory) 

I have especially worked on the visualization of the WiFi and mobile signal 

strength. They have received special importance. Normally they are only divided 

into weak, good and excellent signals. Graphically there are mostly "only" three to 

five bars shown as a mobile signal and three "waves" shown as a WiFi connection. 

My app differentiates the signal strength into a total of 14 bars. This will give 

you a quick visualized and detailed information on your signal strength. 

In addition to the more sophisticated graphical representation of the signal 

strength you will also be able to see some more interesting information. 

Furthermore, there is a log function in csv-file format for wireless and mobile 

signal strength available (for e.g. Excel import). 

With "Mobile Signal": 


Network operators, sim provider, phone type, network type, network strength in dbm 

and ASU, data state, data activity, country code of the mobile phone, device ID, IP 

address (internal und external), roaming state. 

In "WiFi signal": 


WiFi-Name (SSID), BSSID, MAC address, maximum WiFi speed, IP address, external IP 

address, net capability, net channel, subnet mask, Gateway IP address, DHCP server 

address, DNS1 and DNS2 address.
