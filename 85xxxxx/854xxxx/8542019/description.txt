back cover:

In the decades since it was first published, Beginning to Pray has established itself as a modern spiritual classic. Hailed both by Catholics and Protestants, it was written by an Orthodox Archbishop for people who had never prayed before and has been read and loved by persons at all levels of spiritual development.

"The realm of God is dangerous," says the author. "You must enter into it and not just seek information about it ... The day wnen God is absent, when he is silent - that is the beginning of prayer."
