What i did - 
1. Unzip the downloaded content. 
2. Install the APK
3. Copy data/obb as instructed to android/obb/ (Make a OBB folder if there is non)
4. Install the Modded play store!! Link in the description is the original one ! the one you need is  - http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8472729/Google_Play_Store_Modded_by_ChelpuS
5. play and enjoy :) 

YOU NEED ROOT TO INSTALL THE MODDED PLAY STORE! so yes - you need to be rooted to play this:)

,bozypt,2013-06-08T05:33Z,"@ Piratefroggy

One question on that ""tutorial"" you made after i install the modded there is nothing i have to do after that? i just have to play or there is something about the license that i have to do?"
,TheC2G,2013-06-08T06:55Z,"@bozypt

The modded Play Store remove license verification..that's why it must be installed...btw IMO better install modded Play Store first before the game"
,Alimpuyo,2013-06-09T00:28Z,"@TheC2G

""An error has occurred."" pops up when I start the game. how can I fix this?"
,TheC2G,2013-06-09T08:01Z,"@Alimpuyo

Did you installed the modded Play Store ? "
,Chakun,2013-06-09T08:20Z,"I too am getting ""An error has occured."" Any fix for this?"
,Chakun,2013-06-09T09:04Z,Never mind. It seems to be working now. Thank you!
,TheC2G,2013-06-09T09:05Z,"@Chakun 

Did you installed the modded Play Store ? 
If yes but still get those error try install Play Store first before you install this game. This game run fine on my Xperia Go ;)"
,TheC2G,2013-06-09T09:06Z,Glad to know that ;)
,Alimpuyo,2013-06-09T20:51Z,"@TheC2G

,Duah,2013-06-10T23:02Z,"I've downloaded and installed the modded play store by ChelpuS (4.0.27) installed the APK and data using the Asus Google Nexus 7 Toolkit v5.0.0 and I'm still getting the download prompt. I installed the OBB file to sdcard/Android/obb and still nothing, any ideas?"
,TheC2G,2013-06-11T09:10Z,"@Alimpuyo 

If you  have installed the modded Play Store but still get error..try removing lvl verification with lucky patcher...

@Duah 

The .obb must placed in sdcard/Android/obb/com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFIV_GP

But In case you have Samsung or Xperia that recognized Internal storage as Sdcrad and microSD as External Sdcard, place the obb in sdcard not external sdcard..."
