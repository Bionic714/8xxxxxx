,muckymucks,2013-06-05T11:57Z,PDF is bad. Can you post the JPGs or better yet convert them to a CBR?
,nyannyan,2013-06-05T15:57Z,I agree with muckymucks
,turtlex,2013-06-05T19:31Z,"Yeah, jpg is the preferred file type.  That way you can zip them and change the extension to .cbz and read them with a number of comic-reader programs.  That's how most people do it."
,blackout7795,2013-06-06T03:01Z,"Yeah, I'll get on that right now. Thanks for the information, I appreciate it!"
