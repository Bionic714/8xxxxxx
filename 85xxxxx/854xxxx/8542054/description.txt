This are the Soul Eater manga comics I found converted into pdf's from jpegs to maker it a little more convenient for anyone who has adobe or, whatever pretty much :)

Credits go to the guys who made these!!! Look for their signatures in the comics somewhere, the last page of a few of them have it. I think the originals were in Japanese or something so these fellas were cool enough to translate the text to English :] thanks !
