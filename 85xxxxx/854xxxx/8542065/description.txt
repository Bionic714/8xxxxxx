KLGA Enhancements Project 

Version 1.1 6/05/13

Enhancements in this version,

Photoscenery added to the southern section of the airport. Photoreal threshold, etc.
This is a work in progress and will be updated/improved with even more photoreal textures and enhancements.

Installation: Copy all texture files in the package to the texture
directory of your imagine simulationKLGA La Guardia folder. Typically it's in the root directory 
of your FS2004/FS9 directory.

We'll be looking for anyone who wants to contribute to the project. In particular,

1) Someone who can add car traffic to the outside roads/Grand Central would be win.

2) Someone who can throw in the new control tower

3) Someone who could create a tile in the Flushing Meadows Park area. I could apply
the textures

4) Someone who could create the Citifield stadium and or improve the Flushing Meadows Park monuments/buildings.

I'll put out a contact address in the next version for anyone who's interested in helping out.
More to come. Enjoy!
