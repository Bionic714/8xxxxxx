We want flac/vinyl only in this section!"
,LochDhueDude,2013-06-05T20:23Z,"Really, any lossless rip should go here, and does. This post really begs the question, ""were these tracks converted from MP3?"" That would be a real ""no-no.""

Formats that should be allowed here:

Any lossless format rip from vinyl,
Any lossless format rip from optical disc,
Any lossless format download from the web, especially from high-resolution site, i.e. - HDTracks.

I have had problems with ISO files posted here, and for the purposes of wider dissemination it would be great if DTS and Quad formats included regular, stereo FLAC files alongside the multichannel (ISO is the simplest multichannel format) file(s.) 

Of course, we be pirates here, argh, and we be not clampin' down on we brothers and sisters free right to post.
Saying that, those who convert lossy file formats to FLAC, or other lossless formats, and post in this catagory should be made to walk the plank into shark infested waters..."
