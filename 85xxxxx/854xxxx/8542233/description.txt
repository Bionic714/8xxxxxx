Robert Mugabe... what happened?

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Guy de Lancey, published by ZDF in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Robert Mugabe... what happened?, charts the Shakespearean rise and fall of the man who led a very successful African country, and then ruined it. Mugabe was damned as a terrorist, then knighted by Queen Elizabeth, and is still in power more than 30 years later. The film explores what happened through interviews with some of his closest comrades. It assembles a unique collection of southern African archive to powerfully evoke each of the decades of Mugabe's reign. This is a complex and compelling view of Zimbabwe the country and Mugabe the man
