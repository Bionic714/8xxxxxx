Touhou doujin game by Gatling Cat, description taken from http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Katsugeki_Kidan:

"The game is a side-scrolling action/platformer with a heavier focus on action part. The game is split into levels and the goal of each level is to reach and defeat the boss. While the stages themselves don't differ much from traditional 2D action games, boss battles include a lot of danmaku dodging with game's special "dash-grazing" system.
Katsugeki Kidan also features a leveling system, which allows your character to gain more health, strength and spell points. You are also allowed to repeat any of the previous stages, if you feel like you need to level up before attempting next stage. There are a total of 9 stages (including 2 extra).
The game also has a special attack system and a shop, where you can buy items (and special attacks)."
