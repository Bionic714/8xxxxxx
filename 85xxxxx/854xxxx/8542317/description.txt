Banger Boys
Fasten your seatbelts, put on your safety helmet and get ready for the biggest of big bangs as Banger Boys crash on to your TV screens. Banger Boys has spectacular car stunts and tons of dramas as the Dreamers team, led by champion racer Steve Anscombe (aka Cecil) transform cast-off scrap cars into highly tuned mean racing machines. Once the old wrecks have been rebuilt and given a new lease of life they head for the start line. Then it's full on the accelerator as the banger cars enjoy their magnificent moment in the spotlight on a high speed racetrack. Banger Boys follows the Dreamers team as they track down, build, race and smash up cars, as well as exploring the bond that keeps this tightly knit family of racers and engineers together.



2)  Part 2 
Banger Boys leader, Steve Anscombe is fighting hard to win points to qualify for a crack at the World Banger Championship and there's a crucial race meeting coming up. The Dreamers team are up against it to get a fast car ready in time. Meanwhile Louis is the only Dreamer in with a chance of winning the Sussex Championship. The other Dreamers are determined to smash the opposition standing in Louis way. Steve's children, Abbey and Jack, are also getting in on the high octane action in big races of their own. And a complete rookie tries his hand at banger racing; he's in for a shock.

3)  Part 3 
An amazing twist on banger racing as Steve Anscombe, the Dreamers boss, takes to the racing circuit in a smash up involving caravans at the request of a Norwegian TV channel keen to see how their action man presenter will make out in such an unusual event. The serious stuff continues as The Dreamers race against time to get a Lexus car in shape for a National Bangers and Destruction Derby event.

4)  Part 4 
Banger Boys Darren and Pope are hot contenders for a major banger racing cup but their mortal enemies, The Dreambusters, are out to spoil their chances. But the Dreambusters haven't reckoned on Steve Anscombe and the rest of the Dreamers who are out to smash up the Dreambusters before they carry out their evil deeds. Dreamer Flip abandons bangers cars for once to try out something new in a one off Stock Car racing event. And in a World Championship qualifier, Dreamers boss Steve Anscombe has to get into the top three to stand a chance of entering the championship races. Meanwhile Big Hoss is clear favourite to win the Dreamers own Giant Burger eating competition.

5)  Part 5 
Dreamers team captain Steve "Cecil" Anscombe is under pressure, as he has to race a style of banger car which has caused him both injury and near death in earlier races. There's a lot of work to be done if this particular banger is going to pass the winning line first and all Dreamers team hands are on deck to make the deadline. Unfortunately Flip has gone awol. Heartbroken about the death of his pet cat Tiggy, he has decided to take some bereavement leave from the team, so they are one man and one cat down and Louis and dad Phil are about to leave the scene too as they head off abroad for Louis wedding in the sun. Mark sets his sights on a Rover to change his unlucky racing streak but it gets him in to a real spin and Steve manages to get rid of his least favourite car once and for all in a spectacular Destruction Derby.

6)  Part 6 
Steve takes a trip down memory lane to the place where his banger racing obsession began and sources a car for the last fixture of the season at his home track where he's keen to put on a good show. But will his dreams of winning go according to plan? The Dreamers team's arch enemies The Dream Busters are out in force and their mutual loathing threatens to spill out in to the pits after Flip clashes on track, threatening to end the season with a big bang.

7)  Part 7 
Tensions are running high at Banger Boy HQ as the team prepare for two of the biggest races of the season. It's a race for space to get the Dreamers cars ready for the spectacular Firecracker banger racing event, which sees cars competing from all over Europe. Steve is the defending champ and has decided to take a break with his family to get in shape for the big day. But when the boss is away, conflict comes out to play at team headquarters, resulting in Steve having to come back from his holiday early.

8)  Part 8 
This is the last in the present series of Banger Boys and a dramatic climax to the season, as Steve attempts to win the World Banger Racing Championships. Flip and Steve need to win their qualifying races before they can get through to the spectacular final at the same event. But the boys are really struggling to crank their cars up to world final standard. Steve is pinning his hopes on a Lexus, but all isn't going to plan with time running out. Flip is relying on a Nissan to bring him through this huge challenge. But it's a car he has never seen raced as a banger before so he has no idea how it will rate up against some of the UK's best banger racers. Big Hoss is keeping well clear of all this strain, stress and adrenalin in the most unusual way. He's decided to join the all action girl's bowling team for a one off starring appearance.
