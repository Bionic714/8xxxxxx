,ShallowOmega,2013-06-05T14:50Z,Fake! Cutoff frequencies in all files. This is converted 128 kbps stream.

Thanks man.  :)"
[V],politux,2013-06-05T15:04Z,"Spectrals verified, peaking at 22K which means this is legitimate FLAC, not transcoded.

,djh9949,2013-06-05T15:21Z,"Dear ShallowOmega, please kindly fuck off. This torrent is genuine, I've checked it myself."
,cosjm0,2013-06-05T19:35Z,"Politux, why does the Audacity spectrogram show ""01-Restless Feet"" as the track title? No such file on Tomorrow's Harvest."
[V],politux,2013-06-05T20:04Z,"LOL, that would be because I stupidly checked a track from a different album and posted the wrong screenshot.  

Here's the right one:

To be honest some of those purple lines look like artifacts which would mean it is a transcode but I can't say with absolute certainty.  Perhaps someone else can weigh in?

,cosjm0,2013-06-05T23:46Z,"I checked the spectrogram, It's hitting 22K. Also, track times are all correct. This one's legit."
,zophras43,2013-06-06T00:03Z,Both this and the other FLAC torrent linked above achieve the *exact* same results track-for-track using Audio Checker 2.0.
,jeroslav,2013-06-06T08:41Z,"This ""hitting 22k legit FLAC"" is a total bullshit as it doesn't prove anything. Even an 128 kbps mp3 can deliver 22kHz as it is encoded in same sample rate as FLAC (44.1 kHz)"
