5:321 (at this moment) is a travesty. Let's get this up top."
,Ez-Pz,2013-06-05T18:21Z,"What are you, proud that you don't ""intentionally seed"" most torrents you dl? What a tool."
,CStella85,2013-06-05T18:59Z,"I am one of the (few) filmmakers from The Battery. If you enjoy the movie, please tell your friends. No judgement here. We are just 3 normal guys, no studio... The director is a waiter with a broken car.  We hope that at least word of mouth will help us here."
,luvhandler,2013-06-05T20:18Z,"EZ-PZ, I think sephticle is being honest that there are limits to seeding that is individual for everyone for many reasons, however in this case he is emphasizing this torrent for seeding.  

Last, name-calling is not helpful for any reason. Try pausing before you speak. "

Just say thank you and get a better job other than the one you have at McDonald's."
