Here's a review...

Techno has acquired a stereotype of repetition and lack of creativity.This assumption ususally comes from those who hear the radio and/or MTV version of most of the songs and the artists. This is their problem and their loss alike. "The Crystal Method: Vegas" is one of the best CD's relaesed by any artist, of any kind of music in a long time. usually you get 2, maybe 3 songs worth listening to on a CD.I like every song from track (1) "Trip Like I Do to (10) "Bad Stone". It's good, addictive music. You can listen to it, no matter what mood you're in. Busy Child is the only song I no longer listen to anymore. MTV's exploitation on the original "AMP" and the use of it in a GAP commercial ruined it for me. It's still a good song regardless. If you don't like techno, but you haven't heard much, this is the CD to listen to if you want to give it a chance. I recommend it to everyone.
