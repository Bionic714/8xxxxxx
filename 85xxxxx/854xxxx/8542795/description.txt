LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim simplifies multi-domain integration thanks to its easy-to-use simulation platform. All an engineer needs to do is connect various validated components to simply and accurately predict multi-disciplinary system performance.

With extensive dedicated libraries, LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim actually saves enormous amounts of time by eliminating the need for extensive modeling. Thanks to application-specific simulation, engineers can assess a variety of subsystems in multiple physical domains. This way design and engineering teams can carefully balance product performance according to various brand-critical attributes to achieve the best possible design way before committing to expensive and time-consuming prototype testing. Since LMS Imagine.Lab AMESim actually frontloads system simulation early in the development cycle, it truly allows mission-critical design functionality to drive new product development.
