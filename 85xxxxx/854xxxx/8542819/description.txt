Here's a review...

I already owned Vegas but I bought this CD mainly because it had More and the live version of Now Is The Time. I'm really glad I did because I love listening to this CD along with Vegas. However, I could probably live without track 5 because it's basically the same beat over and over without much change but it's still fun to listen to. TCM plays really fast techno/rock kind of music and is great to dance to and just get into the beat. I mainly got interested in TCM after hearing Keep Hope Alive, More, Now Is The Time(olympic mix) and Busy Child from the fifa 98 soundtrack, so I knew that I had to get Vegas. If you love techno than buy this CD and Vegas. TCM ROCKS!!!!
