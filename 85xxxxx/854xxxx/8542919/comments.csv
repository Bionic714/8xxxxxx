,mrmuvis,2013-06-05T18:20Z,Since you are uploading old torrents of classics..plz upload a 720p rip of The Shining (1980) the uncut version.. shockingly nobody has uploaded it..Thnx
[V],GoodFilms,2013-06-05T19:31Z,@mrmuvis. Check HighCode.
,mrmuvis,2013-06-06T00:52Z,"Thnx for replying dude...the problem i find with Highcode releases is that none of them work on any of my T.V.s..i hv downloaded several of his releases but none of them work..probably his compressing style is different..idk..On the other hand i have yet to download a PublicHD release that fails to play..
I'll hope you consider..Huge fan of your releases..:)"
,TheLathe,2013-06-06T08:42Z,"Thank you for posting this frigg'n EXCELLENT film!!!

Just curious though...

It looks like EVERYONE who posted this film has the AC3 audio @256...?  WHY is that since the original BR has LOSSLESS audio?  Just seems like a HUGE downgrade for such a classic film.

Thanks though!

,TheLathe,2013-06-06T20:05Z,"Hmmm...

Well, thanks for whatever you were TRYING to do; I don't understand the additional torrent that appears to be a mirror of this one (with the same audio)

But, I appreciate whatever it was you were doing to help  : )

THANKS!"
