Investigative newspaper reporter Dan Vassar has a 'gift' to suddenly travel back in time, only to enable him to set straight something which caused great problems in the present, for him, his loved-ones or broader society. That puts great strain on Dan's family, including doting but 'deserted' young son Zac and brother Jack, a cop who wants to learn the truth.
