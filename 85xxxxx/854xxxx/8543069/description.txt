Now it's time for you to learn the fundamentals of making your playing sound more full, phat, and flavorful. In Urban and Contemporary Worship Play by Ear Volume 2 you will learn the secrets behind alternate voicings, substitutions, advanced progressions, grace notes and most importantly, a ton of passing tones. All of these tools and concepts are the hidden secret tricks that differentiates one musician from another. You ever see a musician seem to play the same chords you play, but for some reason his playing sounds more full? Or have you ever heard a musician back up a singer and he was able to play all kinds of embellishments and chord changes that sound really phat? Well, that is because that musician built a vocabulary of chords in which to pull from. Your problem is not that you cannot play, it's that you need more chords in your vocabulary. That's what Volume 2 is all about! This DVD will build your vocabulary of phat chords, progressions, and passing tones in order to help you sound more professional and more phat. As a special treat, we will begin to introduce you to the tritone as well. Once you have the vocabulary, you will be able to pull from a plethora of nice chord changes and special nuances that will change the way you play instantly.
