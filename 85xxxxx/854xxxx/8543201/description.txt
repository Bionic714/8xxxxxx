SEEDBOX SUPPORTED!!

From director Uwe Boll's early video game adaptations (House of the Dead, 
Bloodrayne) to his later, more serious-minded efforts (Darfur, Stoic), filmmaker 
(and former crewmember on Boll's films) Dan Lee West focuses on finding out just 
what motivates the notoriously embattled director to continue making films 
despite the popular and critical backlash that continually threatens to sink his 
career. In June, 2006, Boll invited the critics who had bashed his film to step 
into the boxing ring and defend their reviews with their fists. Had Boll's films 
not been the target of continuous pummeling by both internet critics and 
professional film reviewers alike, it would have seemed like a desperate PR 
gimmick. But despite his reputation as a hack, Boll takes filmmaking very 
seriously, and this was his chance to fight back. It's just one of the many 
fascinating chapters in the remarkable career of a filmmaker who, much like Ed 
Wood before him, pours his entire heart and soul into every project he works on, 
yet somehow manages to retain his infamous status as one of the worst filmmakers 
in the history of cinema.

---------------

This is friggin' great!  Watch Uwe lay waste to four of his harshest critics who 
all wrote checks with their mouths that they couldn't cash with their asses.  No 
matter what you may think of Uwe Boll or his works, the guy stands up for 
himself.  You go, Uwe!

Enjoy!
