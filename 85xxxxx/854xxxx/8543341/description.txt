GrooVe IP is an android app that connects to Google Voice using Voice over IP (VoIP). 

What this means for you is you can make free unlimited calls to any phone in the US 

or Canada without using your voice minutes. 

GrooVe IP works on any android device, phone or tablet, and allows you to make calls 

using the deviceΓÇÖs data (WiFi or mobile data) connection. If you have a smartphone 

with Wi-Fi connectivity but no mobile plan, you can use this app to convert it to a 

free, full-featured working phone.

This app has a separate dialer that can be used to make calls. Alternatively, the 

native dialer, call-log, contacts, and favorite functionality can be shared between 

the phone and app on a call-by-call basis.

Notes:

Please ensure that your Google Voice account is associated with either a gmail or 

google apps account.

To receive incoming calls you MUST go into your Google Voice account and forward 

calls to Google Chat.
