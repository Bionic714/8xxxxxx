,W1F1Rex,2013-06-05T23:35Z,sounds very familiar to that other movie with the psycho lady out on the revenge path. I will comment on quality when its finished. It has a 6.7 on IMDB with a metascore of 39/100. Lets see how this goes.

Some scenes seemed a bit dark, but overall pretty good quality. Audio is good except for being extremely compressed/squashed in some louder scenes with explosions etc.
Could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Slow as hell and the same story as ....100 others Pretty horrible acting considering the talent..."
,R3D3Y3R1K,2013-06-07T21:44Z,"the heading says its r3 does that mean it has non-english audio, i know it says english is the spoken language, but region 3 is non-english speaking."

Colin Farrell continues to improve in acting.  Noomi Rapace, (Girl with Dragon Tattoo), is interesting and pretty good in her role. 

I usually don't review the films but this one was pretty good and worth the watch.

Thanks again Scene!"

,Phatfish,2013-06-08T18:15Z,"First of there is nothing excellent about this torrent.

Video is ok depending on screen size and the quality of your tv/monitor.

Audio is watchable.

Movie isn't really great to start with but Noomi and typically all scenes with her (there is a lot of course) ruins the little hope I had for this movie. She is as usual flat as a pancake and delivers nothing. Pretty ironic when she is one of the most overrated actors I can think of in contrast to Colin who is on of the most underrated. Considering he is a stereotypical cheesy Hollywood hunk who does all shit movies he is a surprisingly convincing. "
,Phatfish,2013-06-08T22:13Z,"@R3D3Y3R1K:

Wow, no shit Sherlock.

Protip:
Thats, exactly why it's cam audio Einstein.

(I know, I know. But I cant help feeling overly butthurt about the current state of the scene and everything connected with it.)"

,lassik2,2013-06-14T20:49Z,"Audio was good. Video was just OK. It went in and out of focus a little in some spots. That could have just been my setup though because i'm transcoding.

Either way, the movie was really good. The end was a bit ridiculous. Not that the end was bad but you'll see what I mean when you watch it. It just gets a little carried away."

,ouchyfish,2013-06-15T05:54Z,"Don't give a movie a fucking 9 rating and then say ""worth watching."" If you give it a fucking 9 it better be something most viewers cannot go a lifetime without seeing. Stupid fucking fools. Learn how to rate shit. In case your reading comprehension is for shit, ""worth watching"" is about a 4 or 5. Asshat.."
