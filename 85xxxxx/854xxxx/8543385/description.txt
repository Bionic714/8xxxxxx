Hallelujah! I'm a Bum is the seventh studio album from pioneering, two-man Chicago band Local H, who are known for their gut-quaking live shows and incredibly loyal fanbase. The 17-track, double-album was produced by Chicago metal guru Sanford Parker (Yakuza, Bloodiest, Pelican) and showcases the band rocking harder than ever. It's an epic concept record that sees frontman Scott Lucas setting his sights on the deeply divided political climate that exists in the U.S. and around the world, using his hometown as a backdrop to comment on how this polarization personally impacts people.
