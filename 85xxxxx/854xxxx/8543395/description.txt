Lens softness

The results are even more dramatic with RAW-format photos. Local-content photo analysis technology offers you flawless images, even when pushing settings to the max. DxO Optics Pro also preserves the bokeh, avoiding artifacts that can appear in homogenous or deliberately out-of-focus zones.

Light and contrast optimization

Restore the ideal balance between the dark and light zones in your images. New, exclusive DxO Smart Lighting intelligently reveals your photos details under different lighting conditions, including under- or overexposure.

Want to go further? Use the Selective Tone tool to precisely and separately handle highlights, midtones, and shadows.

The HDR mono-image tool provides the final touch, revealing tons of details in burnt or dark zones.
