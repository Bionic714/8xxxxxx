  British alt-rock outfit Beady Eye formed in 2009, several months after the rivalry between Oasis siblings Liam and Noel Gallagher reached a boiling point at a summer festival, resulting in Noel's departure and the band's dissolution. That fall, Liam and three of his former Oasis bandmates -- Gem Archer, Andy Bell, and Chris Sharrock -- booked studio time with producer Steve Lillywhite to begin work on a new album, with plans to release the first single under their new moniker in November 2010. Different Gear, Still Speeding followed in early 2011, marking Beady Eye's debut and earning warm reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. The album was released through the band's own, self-titled label in Europe and Dangerbird Records in the US. Beady Eye then announced they would be playing some Oasis songs during live shows, which culminated in a performance of "Wonderwall" at London's 2012 Olympics closing ceremony. Liam Gallagher and co. then went back into the studio to continue work on their second album.
