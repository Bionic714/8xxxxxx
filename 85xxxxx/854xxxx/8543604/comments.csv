,Lelhaxor,2013-06-06T03:02Z,"Ok, here's how I changed it from Russian to English.
Download a Hex editor (I used HxD, it's free) and use it to edit the CRACKED steam_api.dll.
Press Ctrl+R and replace russian with english.
This worked for me."
,voj2134,2013-06-06T03:41Z,"Lelhaxor, thanks for that. Worked like a charm."

,tedwu,2013-06-07T08:42Z,"Any one can give more in depth step on Lelhaxor's note how to change Russian to English with Hex editor?
I have the editor however dont know how to decode it so I can read the program language in order to make that change. No1 is a machine to understand hexcode as is right?
Somewhere in the game files I read it is created with DOS selected that decoder did not work too."
,tedwu,2013-06-07T08:57Z,"Lelhaxor's instructions are great but need more detail please. Tried again and reinstalled. Im sure problem is the crack steam_api.dll written in russian. Dont know how to change because I cannot decode it right.
Please help"
,MinerVVars,2013-06-07T13:26Z,"You can use Notepad++

Just open steam_api.dll > find ""russian"" and change it to ""english"""
,SMARTYN89,2013-06-07T17:47Z,"shouldn't there be a ""daily prize"" bonus or something like that?
I'm quite sure"
,Lelhaxor,2013-06-07T23:52Z,"@tedwu When using HxD, those are really the only instructions you should need. I'm not sure about other hex editors. HxD has a tab/button/whatever labelled as ""Search"". When clicking ""Search"", it will show 5 options: Find, Replace, Find Again, Find Again (Reversed), and Goto.
You select ""Replace"" and a mini window will pop-up.
This window has 2 blank boxes/bars in the upper part: ""Search for"" and ""Replace with"".
What I did was ""Search for"" Russian, then but English in the ""Replace with"". 
This made the game English for me."
,tedwu,2013-06-10T11:35Z,"Thanks Lelhaxor and MinerVVars had not thought to get response in such sort time to be honest. Game-play looks good on this will definitely love to try it out myself. Quite a fan of tower defense:P
Seeded for 3 days long here hope it helps. 
Thanks again for your awesome support...always something new to learn for me. Been using TPB forever too:D"
