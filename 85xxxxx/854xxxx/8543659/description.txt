    Discovering Statistics using SAS Andy Field and Jeremy Miles - 2010kaiser
    =========================================================================



Hot on the heels of Andy FieldΓÇÖs best-selling Discovering Statistics Using SPSS, Third Edition (2009), the author has teamed up with a co-author, Jeremy Miles, to adapt this textbook for SAS using the most up-to-date commands and programming language available in latest release 9.2. As with its sister textbook, Discovering Statistics Using SAS takes the entry level student from first principles right the way through to advanced level statistical concepts all the while grounding knowledge through the use of SAS. Its approach is to teach statistical concepts as well as the computational principles, commands and language of the SAS software package in one textbook, and given this comprehensive coverage this textbook should be enthusiastically adopted on a wide variety of statistics courses.
