Samsung has added a new multi window feature to a few of their Jelly Bean devices. 

However...there is only a limited set of apps compatible with this new feature.


Check out the Pro version for these additional features: 

- Create shortcuts on your homescreen to open apps or web bookmarks in windowed 

mode (Note 10.1 tablet only) 

- Specify custom window sizes for shortcuts (Note 10.1 tablet only) 

- Open multiple instances of some apps (This is limited by whether or not a 

particular app permits multiple instances...I've yet to find an internet browser 

that allows this, however there are many other useful apps that do allow it) 

- Fast reboot...cuts reboot time to less than half that of a normal reboot 

- Detect new app installs and prompt to enable multi window 

- Backup and restore your enabled apps list
