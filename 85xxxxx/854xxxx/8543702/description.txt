Documentary telling the story of songwriter and performer Neil
Sedaka, the man behind some of the biggest smash hits in history
including Oh Carol, Is This the Way to Amarillo, Solitaire
Breaking up is Hard to Do, and Love Will Keep Us Together.

Sedaka was destined for life as a classical pianist when he was
seduced by the raw sounds of rock 'n' roll. In the early sixties
he recorded a string of teenage anthems such as Calendar Girl,
Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen and Breaking up is Hard to Do.

The arrival of the Beatles on the musical landscape signalled the
end of Sedaka's singing career and he turned to writing songs for
other artists such as the Monkees, Tom Jones and Tony Christie.
But a move to England in the early 1970s was the launch pad for a
remarkable comeback. He recorded with British band 10cc in Stockport
before returning to the top of the American charts with Laughter
in the Rain and Bad Blood.

In 2009, at the age of 70, Sedaka still has a huge following. He
toured the UK to packed houses and released a new album, The Music
of My Life. Singers Tony Christie and Connie Francis, musicians
Graham Gouldman of 10cc and Jay Siegel of the Tokens, and Brill
Building songwriting colleagues Don Kirshner and Carol Bayer Sager
are among those paying tribute to the 'king of doobie-dos'.
