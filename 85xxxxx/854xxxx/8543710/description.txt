DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVIE
--------------------------
In 1375, China was in a state of chaos because of fighting between the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. The korean dynasty, one of 
Korea's ancient kingdoms, sent a delegation, soldiers and a silent slave as envoys to make peace with the new Chinese government, 
Ming. 

However, this delegation was accused of spying and sent in exile to a remote desert. On the way, they were attacked by Yuan 
troops and killed all the Ming soldiers, left only Korean warriors. 

 
Vice Envoy LEE Ji-hun dies from the strain of the march, and tension builds between LEE's bodyguard slave Yeosol and CHOI Jung. 
After overcoming countless obstacles, the Korean warriors arrive at a peddler's inn in the middle of the desert and run into 
Yuan cavalry who have kidnapped Ming's 
princess Buyong. 

CHOI Jung falls in love with princess Buyong the moment he sees her. Meanwhile, Yeosol arrives later, dragging vice envoy 
LEE Ji-hun's body. He cuts off the head of a gypsy who spits on the dead body. Yuan general Rambulhwa sees Yeosol decapitate 
the gypsy with one strike. Princess Furong also looks on from her wagon. 

Yeosol is eventually taken captive by the Yuan cavalry. CHOI Jung picks up a note from Buyong written in her blood that 
says 'Help', and he decides to rescue her so that they can get a boat bound for Korea. 

CHOI Jung's aide Ganam and a warrior from the Commoner's Army, Jinlip, oppose the idea, saying it would be futile. 
They end up proceeding with the rescue with Jinlip shooting the first arrow. Buyong is rescued, 
but only at the expense of many korea warriors' lives.
