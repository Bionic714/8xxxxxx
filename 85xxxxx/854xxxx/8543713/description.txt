Photoshop eBooks Collection 04 of 35 Part 1 :
============================================

Make your own Photoshop Library and Reference Collection.


These collections include eBooks on Photoshop of versions CS to CS6. About 40 

Percent of these books are either out of publication as Hard Copies or exist as 

dead torrents in the torrent graveyard of the internet.


WHY UPLOAD eBOOKS ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF PHOTOSHOP ?


1. Because some of these eBooks give a rare insight into the techniques of 

Photoshop which eBooks of later versions may not, ( although eBooks of latest 

versions are also included).


2. Some of these Gems of eBooks can get you out of a tight spot to fix an image 

when the latest eBooks may not have a solution to your problem.


Note : This eBooks collection is only for serious Photoshop users. Those of you 

who are casual users or feel that this library of Photoshop eBooks is of no use or 

waste of time - Please do not download.

As far as possible, an attempt has been made to include exercise files with the 

eBooks.


The Library consists of a collection of eBooks in .pdf , .chm or Video formats.

Roughly, a total of about 300 eBooks are included and each and every aspect of 

Photoshop is covered.


These torrents do not include eBooks which I have previously uploaded.
