,XanderSploosh,2013-06-06T05:54Z,"@BruceWayneJr  There are plenty of DC comics worth reading, but I doubt you've given them a chance.
Swamp Thing, Animal Man, The Movement, I Vampire, Justice League Dark, Aquaman, etc."
,BruceWayneJr,2013-06-06T11:32Z,Yeah. Right.
,kakuichi1,2013-06-06T14:45Z,"Agreed, not a DC fan either."
,new52,2013-06-06T16:21Z,thanks mirrormaster82!!
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-11T12:01Z,"i like The Movement so far, but this is the only other print series i'm buying from them now. i love their digital-first series -- injustice and adventures of superman being the best of those IMHO.

in general DC has lost the creative steam it had in late 2011 and early 2012."
