Clarence Gatemouth Brown - 1989 - Standing My Ground

A delightfully eclectic program spotlighting nearly all of Gate's musical leanings -- blues, jazz, country, even a hearty taste of "Louisiana Zydeco" -- and a revealing glimpse of his multi-instrumental abilities: he plays guitar, violin, drums, and piano! There's a tender remake of the Chuck Willis R&B ballad and a funk-tinged update of "Got My Mojo Working," but everything else is from Brown's own pen. (AllMusic)
