I had a problem with this cd rip, when i tried to rip the whole cd it wouldnΓÇÖt / couldnΓÇÖt  read track 16. I tried 4 times and it always failed. So I just saved the log report for those tracks ripped. 
I then decided to try and only rip track 16 and it worked perfect and I saved a log report for that. 
All I can do is claim that these FLAC will play on your flac player but you might not be able to make a cd. So If there is a smarter person out there then they might be able to create a Flac to Cd using the info from the logs.

STYX - The Best Of Times (The Best Of) [1997] [only1joe] FLAC-EAC

The British collection The Best of Times: The Best of Styx is a flawed but adequate overview of Styx's biggest hits. Most of the group's best-known songs are here, but they're sequenced out of order, and a few new songs, plus a re-recording of "Lady," are tacked onto the end of the disc..
