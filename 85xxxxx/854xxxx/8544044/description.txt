Pictures at an Exhibition is an album by British progressive rock
band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, released in 1971 as a live album and
re-released in 2001 as a remastered edition including both live and
studio versions of Modest Mussorgsky's classical piece Pictures at
an Exhibition. The original live album was recorded at Newcastle City
Hall in North East England. The opening track of the album was played
on a Harrison & Harrison pipe organ which was installed in the City
Hall in 1928. The organ console is some way above stage level, at the
top of a stepped terrace used for choral performances. The drum roll
connecting the opening track to the next served to cover Emerson's
dash back down to the stage.
