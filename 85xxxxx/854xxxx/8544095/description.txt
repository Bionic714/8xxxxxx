The Singer Not the Song is a 1961 British drama film based on the 1953 novel by Audrey Erskine-Lindop that was directed by Roy Ward Baker and filmed in Spain.

A priest, Father Michael Keogh (John Mills), is sent by Rome to Quantana, a remote Mexican town which is under the control of a ruthless bandito, Anacleto Komachi (Dirk Bogarde). Anacleto is educated and intelligent, and has a "down" on the Church, but he finds in Keogh a man he strangely admires and with whom he can have intelligent conversation. However he does not allow this to distract him from his goal: to expunge the priest from his fiefdom at all and any cost.
