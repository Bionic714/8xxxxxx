Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, June 5 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex and the Infowars crew continue unparalleled reportage from the United Kingdom where the globalist cabal is scheduled to hold its secretive conference later this week. Nightly News host David Knight anchors from the command center in Austin, Texas. 

Reporter Lee Ann McAdoo files a report on the convergence of a recent British lobbying scandal and calls for more transparency by government and corporations, something that is anathema to the covert mission of the Bilderberg conference and its elite participants. 

Alex and Prison Planet.com editor and journalist Paul Joseph Watson run down the latest news and breaking details from Watford, England, and the City of London as the conference gears up and activists prepare to protest in opposition.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
