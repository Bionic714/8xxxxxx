,Backstabing,2013-06-06T03:08Z,"@defgames: Learn to read..

Region.....: FREE "
,defgames,2013-06-06T03:35Z,ok then you do 15 g of download and the time of writing you can find out was pal
,prayforanend,2013-06-06T03:57Z,is the dlc on disk in english as well as french?
,DLM8691,2013-06-06T04:05Z,"Is this only in French?  Even though it's region free, will it only install French content, or is this a PAL source with multiple languages, but a French game?"
,SirenianPrime,2013-06-06T05:57Z,"@DLM8691

I hope it's multi'language. I'm downloading now. Will post later on if nobody else does."
,DLM8691,2013-06-06T06:54Z,"It seems to just be French.  When I installed it, the descriptions were all in French.  When I loaded it, the text was in English, but the audio was in French.   So I believe it's only French, but if anyone can find a way to load English audio, please tell us, though it doesn't seem to be possible.

I hope an English release comes out soon.  Kinda bummed, wasted a disc."
,DonnieHill618,2013-06-06T07:01Z,French. Its all French. Can't change it Fuckin French
,SirenianPrime,2013-06-06T08:19Z,"If I had the hardware, I'd go buy the NTSC English version and share it. I have an old Hitachi drive, but no way to hook it up."
,angsang_wsj,2013-06-06T10:02Z,so if i install the dlc and use my original copy of skyrim it will still be in french???
,DLM8691,2013-06-06T10:30Z,"@angsang_wsj

If you have an American version of the game, the text will all be in English, but the audio will be in French.  I'm not sure if it's the same for PAL, but on my US original copy, it installs fine and the text is in English, but the audio is all in French.  "
,Backstabing,2013-06-06T11:42Z,"Seriously everything you need to know is in the NFO, stop being a bunch of fucking inbreds."
,DLM8691,2013-06-07T03:23Z,"@backstabing

That's just not true.  For example, the NFO says it's  a RF game, but ABGX says it's PAL/NTSC-U only.  Many times you can't trust the NFO.  Sometimes there are bits of misinformation or things not mentioned."
