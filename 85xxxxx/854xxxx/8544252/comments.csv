Not sure if this is the MoNGoLS release from today, since it doesn't state.  But at start of game on route to church, it crashes just before the gas station with the Dinosaur logo sign.

Just saying since there's 1 seeder, and tons of downloaders atm.  But then again, this release may be different"
,shikibane,2013-06-06T03:05Z,@Brenry I downloaded this myself from xbl so it's not MoNGoLS release.
,shikibane,2013-06-06T03:16Z,This isn't MoNGoLS release.
,Brenry,2013-06-06T03:21Z,shikibane: thanks for the heads up .. Yours may be the best copy atm :D  Could someone please report back if they can get to the Church successfully ?
,shikibane,2013-06-06T04:09Z,"@Brenry got passed the church with no problems, still playing it hasn't crashed yet."
,Brenry,2013-06-06T04:41Z,Thank you so much shikibane !!!

,samengo,2013-06-07T14:54Z,Dont download this shit it has minor sound Problems and is boring as fuck
,shikibane,2013-06-08T21:32Z,@samengo There's going to be a title update very soon to fix alot of issues or so I've heard. As for it being boring i have to disagree.
,Brenry,2013-06-09T19:14Z,"shikbane: yup.  Kid with limited tastes.  Much appreciate your snappy upload on this.  Beat it last night, that title patch that comes out this week changes alot especially with issues of research and other stuff going on real clock times and not in game day cycles, would definately play it again after the TU update."
,xbruce,2013-06-14T16:25Z,This is one amazing game.. I've played everything around for the last decade. Its worth the purchase guys.
,Slackerguy,2013-06-14T23:26Z,"Will you be uploading the Title Update When it becomes available?

It would be very appreciated!"
