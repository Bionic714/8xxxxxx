This is the best version of Astrid Lindgrens's famous book for kids about Rasmus, who escapes from an orphanage and hooks up with the hobo Oscar.
While they are looking for some parents to take care of Rasmus we see different aspects of vagabond life in Sweden in the start of the 20th century, and there is of course a plot involving Oscar getting in trouble with the law.
