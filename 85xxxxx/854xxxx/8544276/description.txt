This is the last appearance of Hillary, and her only one in Season 2.
It's really a cameo as she's seen going into Mr. Fields' rooming house
after briefly talking to Mike the cop.

No explanation was given about her leaving the show, but behind
the scenes Ms. Brooke got a new job playing Roberta Townsend, 
a semi-regular on the "My Little Margie" sitcom.

This episode "In Society" isn't one of the better ones, but it shows
how out of place Bud & Lou can be with rich people and that's amusing!
One bit at the end they had previously done on The Colgate Comedy Hour.
