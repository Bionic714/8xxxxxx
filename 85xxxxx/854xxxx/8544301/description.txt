About 70 percent of the planet is covered by oceans, and Frenchmarine photographer Plisson here offers arresting images of these vastbodies of water in all their incarnations. In his preface, PrixGoncourt-winning writer Yann Queff√©lec recalls the sea's "perpetual,static velocity," and these overwhelming photographs-400 in all-are atestament to that paradox. Some portray human interaction with theocean: fisherman casting their lines from a craggy jetty; wavescrashing over a railing, soaking onlookers; hundreds ofpleasure-seekers wading into the water's edge on a summer day.

Othersdepict the sea's vast and mottled surface, with nary a ship insight. The book's design, which positions all the captions at the end,allows readers to be swept up by the remarkable images. Some photosare panoramas, spanning four fold-out pages. From Portugal toPolynesia, Plisson succeeds in documenting the sea's tremendouspresence.
