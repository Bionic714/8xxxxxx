Another book seemingly without a good digital version easily available, hence this scan. 

Very strange and very funny non-novels. Be sure to listen to this as well as reading it -- the audiobooks are a revelation:

description:

The Trilogy has always been considered the central work of Samuel Beckett's fiction (winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, 1969), the three novels that have been most admired and have received the greatest amount of critical comment, just as Waiting for Godot written in the same period of concentrated creativity between 1947 and 1949, is central to Beckett's drama. "Beckett's oeuvre towers above that of most of his peers, as of his forebears and followers, because it's such a model of integrity: the beauty that is truth" -- Michail Howowitz
