This is a library of torrents, ranging from 600-900 mb. All are either avi. or mp4. format and in English. I've tried to trackdown as many hard to find torrents to help you find what you're looking for. Some are separated by actors/ actresses, some are located by type. Help seed the ones that need help, most don't need it. Some are the old movies you almost forgot, but I've done my best in finding movies without any personal watermarks or not wanted subtitles. Some have optional subtitles in many diffent languages.

These came from 40 torrent sites, but sorry I couldn't find all
the movies for the actors. The amimated ones starring the voices
of ... are in Kids & Family folder.

I hope everyone enjoys. Open Library List files to see a list of movies in each library. I'll keep looking for more movies.
