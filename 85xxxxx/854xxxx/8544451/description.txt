Plot: Welcome to the muddy, funny and marvellous Top Gear Africa special in which Clarkson, Hammond and May saddle up three tired old estate cars and set off to find the source of the Nile. Their journey starts with insane traffic jams and mountainous speed bumps, takes in dubious hotels and ingenious modifications, before entering an epic odyssey of treacherous mud, impenetrable forests, vicious crocodiles, and truly breathtaking scenery, building to a brilliant, brutal climax and a glorious landmark discovery.
