,maddog7777,2013-06-06T07:26Z,I personally would not trust anything from Drarbg! Most of the stuff he has posted lately was not what was actually in the torrent title. So he has fallen victim to the forums new labeling system and misleading people who DL stuff. Not even sure how he got a green skull next to his name. Do not be surprised if this is not an R5 line and just some crappy Camrip with bad audio.
,Juular,2013-06-07T02:42Z,"maddog7777: He has a greenskull because he's been uploading LEGIT stuff for years. If you download something that has CAM audio instead of LINE, try blaming the fucking scene group. And yes, it's very common for people to upload scene stuff without checking it themselves. Don't shoot the messenger."
