Jockeying to be the ultimate mom, this perfectly coiffed and manicured clique will stop at nothing to one-up each other. Whether itΓÇÖs extravagant birthday parties, devising a strict vegan diet for their one-year-old or masterminding their babyΓÇÖs social climb (or should we say crawl?) to the top, thereΓÇÖs no end to their plotting and scheming. Knowing the competition among them is fierce, these swanky mothers take motherhood and mischief to an entirely new and outrageous level. As one Pretty Wicked Mom claims, ΓÇ£They all want to be the prettiest, the thinnest, the richest; and their kids to be the smartest.
