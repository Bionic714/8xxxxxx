You have loyal following of people who greaty appreciate you for all the time and effort you put into capping, transcoding/encoding, and torrenting this series. 

p.s. love the anit-whining pics"
[V],catflap,2013-06-07T11:46Z,"I don't know about there being a loyal following :)
but when I think something is interesting and
there are no other people or groups releasing it
I try to fill the gap when I have time - because my
own downloads have priority.

So thanks for downloading my stuff. :)"
