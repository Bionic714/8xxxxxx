***I am completely sorry for the slow download, in labeled the title incorrectly and tried to delete this torrent so that I could re-upload, and deleted the file from my uTorrent program. Now that people are leeching there is no way to delete the torrent and I deleted this torrent from my uTorrent so now I can properly seed it!***"
