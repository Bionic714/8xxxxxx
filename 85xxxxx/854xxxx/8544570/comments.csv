,onlyHD,2013-06-06T12:31Z,"Thank you !!!

Keep Rocking :)"
,iamspellborn,2013-06-07T16:43Z,"hey Jalucian, can you do this movie, cause i can't find a good rip anywhere?

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1486185/?ref_=sr_1"
,jalucian,2013-06-08T18:32Z,"YIFY did Riding Hood in 720p, or were you needing 1080?

Also guys (anyone), need some requests/recommendations for some mainstream movies that will be self-sustaining and well seeded (like my encodes of Ted and Pulp Fiction.) "
,iamspellborn,2013-06-08T21:42Z,"(yeah, i meant 1080p + subs...)

You could do the Twilight films in 1080p, Despicable Me, Armageddon, War Of The Worlds, the Meet The Parents trilogy, Sex And The City 1 and 2 and i can keep going on and on about mainstream films without a quality rip out there. Also, i can't find anywhere the SEQUELS to most Disney Classics films... ;)"
,iamspellborn,2013-06-08T21:55Z,"also, feel free to do films that yify has already done, cause most of their rips suck.. not to mention the terrible subtitles or the luck of any.

+ i forgot to mention My Big Fat Greek Wedding and of course IMMORTALS and HUNGER GAMES in 1080p with subs... anoxmous and yify's rips are terrible according to the comments and in films like these, that have a lot of special effects, we need the best rip possible!"
,iamspellborn,2013-06-08T22:05Z,"+ a few other epic films that need quality 1080p rips:

Doomsday, Sweeny Todd, Beowulf, Alexander (Director's final cut), King Arthur (Director's Cut), The Covenant, Titanic, Season Of The Witch, Godzilla, King Kong... take your pick :P

(sorry for the 3 separate comments..)"
,dalesteyn,2013-06-09T10:49Z,"@Jalucian
you can consider Black Swan, The Tourist (Angelina Jolie) ...they are not well represented in 1080p...

and a personal one
 TEOREMA(theorem)

,jalucian,2013-06-11T01:26Z,"Goodfellas will be next. Believe it or not, there are no good encodes in 1080 under 4gigs. I'll put Hunger Games on the list as well. I'm also considering Inglorious Basterds (YIFY's 1080 was only 1300kbps!) Also, I'm doing a lesser known HBO original movie called Conspiracy (2001) even though there are no HD sources (it will be 576p, but with high bit rate so it can be 'full-screened') - it's an AWESOME movie about high ranking Nazi officers planning the Final Solution. Be sure to check that one out. It's one of my personal favorites. I'm also considering doing Iron Man 1 and 2 even though it's well represented. Iron Man 2 has a director's commentary track that most encoders do not include, and I'll be doing Iron Man 3 in late August as soon as 1080 sources are available."
,jalucian,2013-06-13T05:48Z,"Slight delay on Goodfellas. I had it completely finished and ready to upload, and then I found another source which had both commentary tracks, so I'm having to re-do it. 

Also, Hunger Games looks pretty well represented now that I look. I know a lot of people aren't big fans of YIFY's audio because they're only 96kbps, but there's another version out there with better bit rates thats about 2.6gigs. I just uploaded Apocalypse Now Redux 1080p and I will be doing Alexander Revisited 1080p (only version of it right now is 17gigs) and by then Goodfellas with both commentary tracks should be done. I'm considering Titanic and Black Swan as well. YIFY's Titanic has an abysmally low bit rate (1532) and his encode of Black Swan had a lot of pixelation and artifacts in the darker scenes."
