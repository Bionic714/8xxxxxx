Terry Moore's "Rachel Rising" is headed to TV

While best known for his long running "Strangers in Paradise" series, in late 2011 creator Terry Moore began "Rachel Rising, a horror-tinged tale of death and resurrection, at his own Abstract Studios. The comic follows a woman who wakes up in a shallow grave and must piece together the mystery surrounding her death. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the recently formed Alcon Television Group is developing "Rachel Rising" as a television series.

While no showrunner is currently attached, Alcon has enlisted producer Lloyd Levin, whose credits include the "Hellboy" films and "Watchmen," to serve as Executive Producer alongside Alcon's Sharon Hall, Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson. Alcon exec Ben Roberts, who consulted on AMC's commercial juggernaut "The Walking Dead," will serve as producer on the potential series. No casting announcements have been made, though that will likely change as talent frees up after the major networks announced their Fall 2013 programming lineups.
