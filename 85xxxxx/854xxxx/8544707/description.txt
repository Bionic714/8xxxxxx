Donna the Buffalo's 1996 album, The Ones You Love, was the first to feature drummer Jimmy Triplett, but lineup changes aside, the group's fifth album continues their festival groove. The Buffalos come through for their fans again on this collection of 11 songs, including "These Are Strange Days," "Off to Dreamland," and "Ancient Arms." The album's warm production sounds almost as intimate as one of Donna the Buffalo's live shows, capturing the intricacy and feeling in their music. The Ones You Love is a strong album by a talented group of songwriters and musicians.
