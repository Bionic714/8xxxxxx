,cyberex,2013-06-06T04:51Z,I have noticed that people don't like to help me SEED my torrents after downloading but they like to seed torrents from other famous users and i don't know why.I am new here and i am not yet as famous as others i know but i am pretty sure i can do better than any other user on this web site.I am just a pour student and i don't have money to subscribe for a better internet connection.So forgive me if my upload speed sucks.I am willing to continuous uploading all new songs and videos i can get but if people don't help me with seeding i am not sure i am going to keep up doing this.
