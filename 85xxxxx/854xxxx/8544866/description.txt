Instruction: how to download fromas a free user "IMPORTANT TO DOWNLOAD"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------don't support twice request. So if you have installed IDM, make sure your download starts within your browser.
To do that press & hold Alt button before clicking download button.
If you register on the site you will get better speed than free user, but not as premium user.
If you want something "free" you have to give something, and here it is your patient.

After download put all parts on same folder, then right click on part-1 and click "Extract Here"
