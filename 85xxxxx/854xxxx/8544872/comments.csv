,muckymucks,2013-06-06T11:14Z,"Relax, dude. We can select what series we want right from the torrent. And besides, it's less than 1GB. Maybe it would've been a problem when we were all on dial-up, but we have broadband, now. 1GB is nothing.

Thanks for the up."

I understand the way people use the internet is alot faster than it was a few years ago, but there are still people out there who have a rough time downloading a 1GB file so I want to make it as convinient as possible for those who dont have a great internet package! and no problem!"
,supkids,2013-06-06T21:43Z,"thanks a lot, but you got Minutemen Issue #04 wrong, it's all in Spanish., Here's an alternative link for that one: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7737798/Before_Watchmen_Minutemen__4"

I'm completely sorry! I have yet to read through all of the Issues yet, therefore I wasnt able to spot the error! Thank you for the link! "

ALSO, if you find any more comics within the torrent that arent in english, PLEASE feel free to post a link to an english version!

@Seeders

Sorry for the inconvinience, I will try to keep a better eye on further uploads!"
