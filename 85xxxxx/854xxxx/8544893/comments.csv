Actually I haven't read an entire volume, I have flipped through both black and white and color and truthfully I say the color looks alot better, you can download both this and a B&W one and I guarantee you'll prefer this version over the other version, trust me!"

,skippiks27,2013-06-06T15:36Z,"RobbieDee - glad to see you're uploading.  Much appreciated.  However, please do not change the file names before you upload the torrent.  That way people will know (1) who scanned the torrent (which gives the scanner some credit for their effort), and (2) lets people know whether they already have the version that you're uploading.  For example, I see that the name of the torrent in this upload (""Scott Pilgrim Vol. 1.cbz"") used to be a file that was named ""Scott Pilgrim Vol. 1 (of 6) Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life (2012) - Color Edition (Digital) (jk-Empire).cbz""

I understand that you may be trying to simplify things, but it actually makes it much more complicated and deprives the community of information and the scanner of credit.

Thank you!"

I plan on uploading both Vol. 2 & 3 today now that people have caught up seeding this one!"

I've downloaded this and most of my upcoming torrents months ago for myself before I started uploading here, so all of them will not have additional information. Any new comics I download, I will leave the contents completely unchanged! and no problem!"
