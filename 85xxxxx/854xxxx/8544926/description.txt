It must take a lot of work to make a squad-based action game. On top of having to deliver all the core aspects that any shooter should have–things like responsive gameplay and great  
graphics and sound–a game designer working with squad-style gameplay also has to worry a lot about artificial intelligence. All it takes is a smattering of instances where a playerâ™s AI  
squadmates get stuck on a wall or take an inefficient path around a few obstacles to really shatter the illusion of working with a team and turn the game into a drone-babysitting  
simulation. Freedom Fighters, the new game from the developers of last yearâ™s great Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, deftly avoids the many pitfalls of AI squad tactics, and this, combined  
with great control, mission design, and presentation, makes for a truly fantastic game.
Freedom Fighters takes place in an alternate reality that never saw the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Instead, the Red threat has continued to grow since the end of World War II,  
taking hold in countries as close to home as Cuba and Mexico. The game opens with the plumbing team of Chris and Troy Stone paying a visit to the clogged sink of Isabella Angelina,  
who also happens to be a vocal member of a watchdog organization devoted to informing the American public about the evils of the Soviet Union. The duo enters her apartment to find  
that it has been hastily evacuated, and soon after, Soviet troops bust in to try to find her, only to capture Troy instead. The Soviet invasion of the US has begun.
After that brief setup, youâ™re thrust into the role of Chris Stone, and you hook up with Isabellaâ™s resistance movement almost immediately. Operating from the sewers beneath New  
York City, the movement aims to overthrow the invaders and drive the communists out of the country. Youâ™ll start as a lowly member of the team, but you grow in popularity and  
influence as the game goes on, and Chris will slowly transform from an average 32-year-old plumber into a battle-hardened leader.
The game isnâ™t terribly long-winded in its storytelling. Most of the gameâ™s plot is advanced by a series of humorous Soviet-run newscasts, which cover your actions as terrorist  
activities. Your missions are laid out in the rebel base, and the briefings are great at explaining the strategic significance of, say, reclaiming a high school building for the red, white, and  
blue. Though the story is told well and works great in the context of the game, itâ™s pretty short on substance. Aside from a foreshadowed plot twist that you can see coming from a mile  
away, not a whole lot happens in the game. It must also be said that the game doesnâ™t provide much closure at the end, simultaneously setting up for a sequel while not really leaving  
you with a tremendous feeling of accomplishment. A more climactic final mission would have gone a long way. These things hardly affect the incredible quality of the gameâ™s action,  
though.
At the outset, Freedom Fighters plays like a rock-solid third-person shooter, with smooth and responsive controls. You can shoot from the hip or raise your weapon for precision firing,  
which causes the camera to zoom in slightly for a cool over-the-shoulder view. You have an inventory of items and the ability to carry a pistol and one primary weapon, such as a shotgun,  
an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, a machine gun, a rocket launcher, or a submachine gun. Youâ™ll also be able to carry grenades, Molotov cocktails, high explosives, binoculars, and health  
packs that restore your health when used, though they can also be used to heal wounded civilians or other freedom fighters.
