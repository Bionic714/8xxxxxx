,trace535,2013-06-06T18:44Z,"Can you ""skip"" on water for a few seconds if you're going very very fast? YES.

Can you make a basic parachute from a shitload of shower curtains? YES.

What happened to the show where Adam and Jamie just spent the episode building something cool and interesting in their shop?"
,PLEIGHER,2013-06-06T22:08Z,Travis Pastrana has gone further.
,Killher,2013-06-07T18:46Z,"@PLEIGHER Precisely. JOLENE can go further than that. No myths here, just junk filler."
,amoeba,2013-06-08T07:45Z,@killher: It can't possibly be as bad as the Deadliest Catch special. That episode pissed me off.
