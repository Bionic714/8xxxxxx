,DrKrank,2013-06-06T18:12Z,Fake!!! -.-
,Xinica,2013-06-06T22:53Z,"DrKrank are you trying to be a troll??? This is %100 Legit, it uses steam servers to play online, you can find it on my Kat account w/ conformation that Multiplayer works, Maybe you should test it before leaving stupid comments"
,a7madmad,2013-06-07T00:27Z,If anybody completed downloading please confirm.
,Zebra667,2013-06-07T05:24Z,"I fuckin' hate it when people say that shit...'Please confirm!'...Now, think about this for a second, seriously. You just asked someone to confirm that the torrent is what it says it is, but why would you have any reason to take their word over the one who posted the torrent in the first place?! And for that matter, if three people said 'Confirmed! It's Legit' and then another comes in and says 'No, it's fake garbage!', which one are you going to believe and why? What makes any of them better than any of the others? Your question makes NO FUCKING SENSE! You want confirmation? Download the fucking thing yourself and find out!"
,Xinica,2013-06-07T08:46Z,"Ya, as Zebra said, anyone's word can be either a miss-understanding or someone who wants to sabotage someone or a backup account of the person who uploaded it and is lying, you'll never know unless you try it, if you aren't comfortable with it, message me via Kat, username is still Xinica, And I can give you any conformation you need, thanks :)"

,Vaelio,2013-06-09T11:17Z,"Hello ! in carreer when i have to change my name , nationality and all that , im just crashing with giving any error message :s can you help me ?"
,M_Thre3,2013-06-09T12:03Z,"game works. multiplayer doesnt. the cockpit view works aswell. just cannot connect to racenet nor does it join any sessions in the matchmaking. tried every1's multiplayer cracks and none work. not skidrows, not Ragnos1997 or urs. some people say they got it working. but im yet to find 1 that works."
,M_Thre3,2013-06-09T12:14Z,"i dinno wat happened to my previous comment. the game does work. the multiplayer doesnt work. the cockpit view works. im sure all the dlc packs r there. but it doesnt connect to racenet. nor does it find any sessions wen u try a custom game. i tried Skidrows, Ragnos1997 and now Xinica, none of them work. i've tried with my proper steam account and a new 1. still doesnt work. i've checked that it is allowed in the firewall, run game as administrator but still nothin. im wonderin if any1 has actually got it workin or if its just a hoax..."
,mattcalls,2013-06-09T13:23Z,@Vaelio Same for me... any suggestions? maybe you've found a solution?
,Vaelio,2013-06-09T15:47Z,"Na not yet sadly :/ 
tryed to reinstall , to apply some fix ive found on internet , but still no update :/"
,Vaelio,2013-06-09T15:48Z,Even tryed compatibility mode ( because im using win8 )
,mattcalls,2013-06-09T17:13Z,"If you find the solution, please tell me :) but until that you can still enjoy the multiplayer, coz it works.. at least it works for me :D"
,Vaelio,2013-06-09T21:45Z,"Okay dude it seems i've found the solution , once you know that a cinematic is comming out , just press alt tab - the game gonna be in windowed mode , and there it works , dont ask me why xD -"
,Jettyy_,2013-06-10T04:23Z,"I'm having the same problem, where the game crashes when you go enter the name and country and stuff. I did alt tab, but it still crashes. I really need help and I love this game already even though I've only played one race!"
,mattcalls,2013-06-10T13:18Z,Dang it! still the same... I'll probably just download another non-multiplayer version then ;(
,Xinica,2013-06-11T00:31Z,"Hey guys, sorry for late reply I'm busy cracking Skyrim Legendary, anyways, the crash is an existing problem with paid versions of Grid 2 as well, CodeMasters are aware of this issue and are working on a patch at the moment, I will post it as son as it is released, as for multiplayer. Make sure your firewall gives full privileges to the game, currently tested on 6 different computers and multiplayer works, It won't connect to race server but if you go to Events and start a game it has worked for me. There are crucial dll's in there that make this possible so make sure your antivirus hasn't cleaned/quarantined/or deleted these. Try re-installing and backing up your saved games so you can start where you left off. Hope this helps! :)"
,Xinica,2013-06-11T00:32Z,soon*
,StickyIckyIcky,2013-06-13T17:58Z,"I Have found the solution to the crashes with no error! 
probably the game has a problem with quad core cpu and the solution is to open your task manager, and find  the grid 2 process, and set affinity to 3 cores only. i tried it and never crashed before. hope it works ;)"
