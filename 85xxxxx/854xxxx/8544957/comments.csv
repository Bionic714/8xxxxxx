I've noticed the webrips of Hitman were upped for issues 1 - 40, but have seemed to have stopped with just 20 or so more to go - unless I missed them?  Looking forward to seeing the completion of this great series!"

You wouldn't happen to have Long John Silver 01, would you?  Did I miss it in an earlier pack?"
,Extremist,2013-06-09T02:04Z,"Hey shipJ, thanks for all uploads! Seems like you messed up this week though. These three packs contains the exact same files as last week's five packs. Commenting this in all packs in case you didn't notice!

Oh, and I'm not ungrateful! Just letting you know! (No need to flame me, guys) ;-)"
