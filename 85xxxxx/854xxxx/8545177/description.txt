Abraham, Jerry and Esther Hicks 
http://www.abraham-hicks.com/lawofattractionsource/index.php

In 1985, Jerry and Esther Hicks began dialogs with Abraham. But who, or what, is/are, Abraham . . . really? Abraham is a name. A symbol. A feeling. Abraham is a Non-Physical entity ΓÇö whom Esther calls "infinite intelligence" and Jerry stated, "the purest form of love I've ever encountered."...
Thank you to all who participated to make this possible!
