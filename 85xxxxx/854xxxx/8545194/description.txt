This first programme tells the back stories of the real people that
the event is following in real time and sets out their missions over
the following 24 hours. The D-Day seven include a paratrooper, a midget
submariner, a nurse and a military cameraman.


A 24-hour history event broadcast across TV, web, mobile devices and
social media, telling the story of D-Day in a completely new way.

Viewers can track the progress of seven real people who participated
in the 1944 invasion, moment by moment in real time, encountering the
twists and turns of the fighting at the same time as the D-Day seven
did, and learning their fate as the action unfolds in parallel with
the present.

Presented by Peter Snow, with Channel 4 Paralympics presenter and
former marine Arthur Williams, and experts including former British
Army officer Colonel Tim Collins and front-line journalist Lorna Ward.
