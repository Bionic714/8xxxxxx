,evildog1,2013-06-07T10:34Z,Can you make iso file? I want to watch movie without dvd...
[V],immagical,2013-06-07T21:17Z,"@evildog1...  maybe i will start doing avi or mp4 files as well sometime.. 
but at the moment i'm putting them in dvd format simply because people can just burn it as it is straight to a dvd disc..  

all my files have been converted into the dvd like format, so there is no need to do anything further apart from burn to disc..
or, you can, if you want, convert back to avi or any other format you wish..

Thanks for downloading and helping seed.. ;)

,evildog1,2013-06-11T22:30Z,"i rated this movie you recorded with cam

video: 7.5/10
Fine and watch able...

audio: 3/10
your camcorder's mic could not record shooting sounds, explosion sounds and smashing sounds. i think the volume was too high..."
