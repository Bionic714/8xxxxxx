The set features for the first time the original June 17, 1986 concert at The Spectrum in Philadelphia in its original running order. The concert film has been restored from the original 16mm film and the soundtrack has been remastered for the new DVD release. The film is notable because it features guitarist Craig Goldy who had recently replaced original lead guitarist Vivian Campbell.
