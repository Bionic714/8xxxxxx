,Silvak,2013-06-06T15:32Z,and/or Locke and Key: Omega #5?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T16:05Z,"KA3 #1 hasn't been scanned yet, I don't think. (Mark Millar doesn't release his titles digitally until months later.)"
,Neon_Jackal,2013-06-06T16:12Z,Finally! Thanks. any word on Hawkeye and Scarlet Spider? Aren't they supposed to have new issues out as well?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T17:03Z,"the marvel site lists both of them as 6/5 releases but they aren't available on comixology and aren't in this week's list on comiclist. so i'm not sure what's happened, although my 1st guess is that marvel blew their ship dates..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T17:08Z,hawkeye 11 and scarlet spider 18 are late and now both have a ship date of 6/26
,Neon_Jackal,2013-06-06T17:31Z,"Wowee, that really is late, thanks for the info, and the uploads."
