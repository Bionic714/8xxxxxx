===================== NOTE =====================
.

If any of MY torrents get NO or only a few Comments

Then I take this as:

You never liked the series
You never liked the quality
You are ALL very ill-mannered

It does no matter which one of the above, but

I will not post any more in that series.
I will not re-seed any torrent that has no comments

I never reseed for downloaders I do not know
If you've never posted a comment on my torrents I do not know you
Do not ask for a re-seed you will be ignored
.
Once 5 people complete I stop seeding
.
[b]I do NOT expect comments on how great I am, I already know that
Comments on quality help YOU the downloaders[/b]

=================================================

Steptoe and Son is a British sitcom written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson about two rag and bone men living in Oil Drum Lane, a fictional street in Shepherd's Bush, London. Four series were broadcast by the BBC from 1962 to 1965, followed by a second run from 1970 to 1974. Its theme tune, "Old Ned", was composed by Ron Grainer.

The series was voted 15th in a 2004 BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom. 

It was remade in the US as Sanford and Son, in Sweden as Albert & Herbert and in the Netherlands as Stiefbeen en zoon. In 1972 a movie adaptation of the series, Steptoe and Son, was released in cinemas, with a second Steptoe and Son Ride Again in 1973.
