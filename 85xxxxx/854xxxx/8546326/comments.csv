[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T16:22Z,"it has been! running very, very late. #2 came out March 27th!  :-0"
,PM987,2013-06-06T16:28Z,"Thank you so much for posting this, STFmaryville!  I really appreciate it.  is there any chance you can post the last Battlefields series that ended a few weeks ago by Ennis and Braun -- The Fall and Rise of Anna Kharkova three issue series?  Thanks again."
,blogcb,2013-06-06T16:28Z,"I somehow missed #2, so here's a link in case you did as well.  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8308207/RED_TEAM_002_(2013)_(Dynamite)_(1920px)_(K6-Empire)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T16:53Z,"PM987, i posted links for those the last time you asked me about them. (see my GOTHAM BY GASLIGHT torrent.)"
,binderguy1,2013-06-06T17:09Z,"Thanks for the ul!

@ PM987:  you should check the 0-day torrents that are ul-ed weekly by SJolly.  I think I've seen the Battlefields issues you may have missed.  You might have to check the past couple of months, though."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T17:35Z,those were the links i posted for him!  ;-)
,PM987,2013-06-06T17:39Z,"Thank you very much, STFmaryville.  I'm sorry I missed your comments on the Gotham by Gaslight torrent.  I will check them out.   I download the torrents through the magnet link.  Is there any way to download only a portion of a torrent through magnet links?  I would prefer not to have to download a 7 GB file to just get one book.  Thanks again for everything."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-06T17:55Z,"absolutely! when you click the magnet link, be patient and let the content list of the big-ass torrent load. then you can uncheck all the boxes, and put a check mark beside the one book you want!

(the above is written based on the uTorrent 3.3 software interface. of course your option could vary if you use something different!)

and no worries, i'm not upset, i am just so busy that i couldn't/can't upload a torrent of them. but wanted to send you in the right direction!"
,binderguy1,2013-06-06T18:09Z,"If you are using Bittorrent or Utorrent, everytime you click on ""Get this Torrent"" and you should be getting a pop-up listing all the files that can be dl-ed.  Just click on the Select None icon and then select what files you want to dl.

That way will cut down on the huge dl."
,PM987,2013-06-06T21:15Z,"Thank you, STFmaryville and binderguy1."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T01:19Z,you're welcome
