2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I've had a chance to recently connect remotely to a couple of different computers.  People I didn't necessarily know.  Lately, it seems, I'm the go-to person to fix various computer problems.  And it's always an extra cool feeling to see some Christian music, Christian wallpaper, or some other form of Christ on those hard drives.  To learn that you're helping out a fellow Believer.

And yet it's even more, dare I say "humbling", to learn they've been downloading some of these "The Year In Christian Music" bundles.  And they don't even know it's me who has been torrenting them.

"I really like Beckah Shae, and Matthew West.  I discovered them in some of these music bundles", one person told me.

God's clearly at work here my friends.  Please add to that by doing your part.  Burn a disc for a friend.  Continue to torrent a day or two longer than normal.  Encourage your children to learn a new Christian song tomorrow.  Introduce a neighbor to a Christian artist this weekend.  Play some Christian, instead of secular, on your drive into work tomorrow morning.  But most of all, thank God almighty for His merciful glory in all things, including these songs we're able to share with one another here today.
