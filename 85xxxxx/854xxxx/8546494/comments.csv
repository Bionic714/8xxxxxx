,PM987,2013-06-07T03:38Z,"Thank you, STFmaryville for this and your other help.  I was able to download the 3 final Battlefields issues without a problem thanks to you.  

One other question.  I have looked for it all over the internet but have never seen a series by John Romita Jr. called The Gray Area and published by Image in 2004.  Its the only series JRjr ever wrote as well as drawing and its 3 issues long.  I don't think its in a 0-day torrent.  Any help you could give in locating it is appreciated.  Thanks again for everything."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T04:26Z,"yeah the 0-days don't go back that far, but i think i can find it. i don't think romita wrote it, though. he may have plotted it but i see someone else credited as writer."
,PM987,2013-06-07T06:08Z,"That would be great if you can find it.  yeah my memory was off, it looks like JRjr co-plotted it, not wrote it.  i remember a podcast interview he gave where he said it's one of his favorite projects ever and he thought it would make a good movie."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T14:58Z,"here ya go: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8549769/GRAY_AREA_01-03_Complete_%282004%29_%28Image_Comics%29_John_Romita__Jr.

i'm glad you asked for it, as i'd never heard of it and he's one of my favorite artists. visually, i found it odd that his rudy looks like jackie estacado from the darkness.

maybe someday he'll get it made for film or tv. if anyone deserves to get rich from a movie option, i'd say JRJR does.

you might like to download the modern masters: john romita, jr. book by twomorrows publishing if you haven't already: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7709272/"
,PM987,2013-06-07T16:26Z,"STF, I left a comment for you in The Gray Area thread.  Thanks again for posting it so quickly.  I actually own the Modern Masters JRjr book and have looked at it so much that the center pages of the book fell out of the binding! ;)

I have never read The Gray Area so I'm looking forward to it a lot.  I think it's the only creator owned work JRjr did before Kick-Ass.

Cheers! "
