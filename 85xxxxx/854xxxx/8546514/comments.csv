,zmus,2013-06-06T23:20Z,"Is it really so hard to seed for a couple of hours? 7 seeders is just pathetic, guys. C'mon."
,prblmc,2013-06-07T00:33Z,"wow mtv website had full episode before piratebay, this is a first"
,atndigcrk,2013-06-07T02:28Z,"yea lol same thing i thought

Really dude????? SO you come to somebody elses torrent to promote your own? Really???

Just to make it clear to everyone, it's simple: 1GB file=HD quality! As the name states its a 720p file so that's why the file has a bigger size. If someone haven't uploaded it yet, I would."
,atndigcrk,2013-06-08T00:51Z,calm down buddy its not a competition 
,sykoskit,2013-06-09T13:38Z,"yeah actually his purpose wasn't to promote his torrent, he came here and responded to the complaints of your file size being too big, and even offered to help you, but you didn't contact him, so he uploaded the smaller file size that the people were asking for. if you had uploaded a smaller file or contacted him as he offered then he probably wouldn't have posted the link. he was trying to accommodate everyone. so now people who want the big HD version can download yours, and people who need the smaller file because they don't have a huge hd or fast enough modem can download his. just because it is the same episode doesn't make it a competition... i appreciate both of you guys, nobody else really uploads Real World, so i usually tend to download and seed both, because i know some people really want these, and i also know that some people want better quality OR smaller files, so it's a great idea to have both. it's like TvTeam, they upload 2/3 different torrents of the same episode, some with high quality, some with smaller files... they aren't competing with each other, they just understand the supply/demand better than others. you'll get the hang of it. don't get upset. obviously most people want the higher quality which is why yours has more seeders, but some people still need the smaller file... it's not like he STOLE your seeders... lol. don't trip man. it's all good. everyone still wants your torrents. just don't make yourself look bad, and you'll be vip in no time. thanks for your hard work, both you and atndigcrk. i think you guys are awesome. don't fight with each other... maybe you guys should work together... like TvTeam.. oh and you guys should DEFINITELY upload The Challenge episodes when they come out, i was having a hella hard time finding them last season, so if you guys work together and both do it, then everyone will be happy. sorry for the long psychologist-type comment... just trying to make peace between two of my favorite uploaders. thanks guys"
,zed1234,2013-06-10T01:26Z,"Hey I appreciate your effort to calm things down but things weren't heated up. I'm sorry if I sounded like I was angry or something but I was just incredulous.
I find it a bit odd that another uploader puts his torrents on another uploaders torrent but that was all. I actually use @atndigcrk as my standard because he is usually the first to upload the episodes. 
I don't think this is a competion and I know that there is a demand for several types of file size and quality so that's fine to me that the uploaded the smaller size file.

Now to you @atndigcrk:
If you want to work with me contact me here --> https://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&uid=319859
I would be honoured to work with you ;)

PS: I will definitly be uploading the next Challenge's episodes "
,sykoskit,2013-06-10T13:19Z,awesome... if you guys collabo'd you'd be unstoppable.. since nobody else wants to upload real world torrents... and i'm glad things weren't as bad as they seemed. lol. i would hate for my two favorite uploaders to hate each other. thanks guys
