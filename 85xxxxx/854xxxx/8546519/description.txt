Thursday 06-06-2013: Jean-François Copé - President, UMP Party, France

France is one of the political heavyweights of the European Union, a key world economy and a major global player. HARDtalk speaks to Jean-François Copé, the leader of the UMP, the main opposition party on the centre-right, who has lurched farther to the right on issues like gay marriage. He has also made comments about the French Muslim community which have led to accusations that he is threatening cultural harmony. Is he in danger of consigning his party to the political dustbin at home and on the world stage?
