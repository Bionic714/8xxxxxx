 Parsimonious Bhanwarlal is a Bania who lives   
 in Navalgarh, Rajasthan, along with his wife;  
 his sons Sunderlal and Kishanlal; Sunderlal    
 is married to Gajrobai and has a son. During   
 the annual camel race, Sunderlal loses the     
 race to the Thakur and out of shame leaves     
 home, never to return. Now Kishanlal has come  
 of age and is married to Lachchi. But on the   
 very next day of the marriage, he must leave   
 for Jamnagar to attend to business, and can    
 only return after five years. A tearful        
 Lachchi bids him goodbye, but to her pleasant  
 surprise he returns within a few days, and     
 informs his dad that he had met a holy sage    
 who had instructed him to return as he will    
 find five gold coins every morning. Pleased
