When heΓÇÖs on a break from his day job as bassist for perpetually chill Jersey rockers Real Estate, Alex Bleeker records with his group of Freaks, a rotating collection of friends and fellow musicians, and makes equally laid back jangle pop filtered through hazy summer air and leisurely Sunday afternoons. On How Far Away, his second LP, Bleeker enlists the likes of Mountain ManΓÇÖs Amelia Meath, WoodsΓÇÖ Jarvis Taveniere, and Big TroublesΓÇÖ Sam Franklin, among others. The result is a breakup record of sorts; Bleeker provides a mixed bag of inward facing tracks dealing with the dissolution of a relationship and wonders what the hell he should do next.
BleekerΓÇÖs no poker player here, showing his hand immediately on opening cut ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt Look BackΓÇ¥: ΓÇ£DonΓÇÖt look back on the way we met/ DonΓÇÖt look back at me now/ DonΓÇÖt retract all the things youΓÇÖve said/ DonΓÇÖt back out on me.ΓÇ¥ Thematically, itΓÇÖs more overtly insular than anything his primary band has ever released, but sonically it doesnΓÇÖt stray too far from Real EstateΓÇÖs signature day-at-the-beach aesthetic. Girl trouble is well-worn song subject matter, sure, but when BleekerΓÇÖs husky singing voice cracks and trembles like an 8th grader asking his crush out on a date, it humanizes his woes.

Bleeker knows things are going to be okay, though. He admits as much on country-flavored standout ΓÇ£Step Right Up (Pour Yourself Some Wine)ΓÇ¥ with the line, ΓÇ£IΓÇÖll do fine, people tend to change their mind/ You canΓÇÖt hold on to the past or what you left behind.ΓÇ¥ There are some missteps along the way, namely the plodding electronic misadventure ΓÇ£Time CloudΓÇ¥, but Bleeker still manages to pack a nifty little story arc within How Far AwayΓÇÖs 10 short tracks. Putting aside some of those rough edges, however, the record is a more than adequate diversion until Real Estate return with LP3.
