,Mothra67,2013-06-06T17:46Z,"why thank you!  I needed the EC stuff for my collection anyway, so it was cool.  I had the cash, and it's amazing what you can find on Ebay these days!  lol"
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-06T21:48Z,"..Just proves what I said the other day: Those who want the scans can't afford the books to help spread the wealth, and those who have the wealth don't wanna break the slab and/or share the wealth. I figure less than 10% of the total output of EC has been scanned, Finding the pasteups for ""Brother Power"" #3 will be easier.

still, muchos grass, Mothra. I'll keep these up for a week or so to help out!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T01:17Z,"whatever happened to those nice collected editions that russ cochran (i believe) was producing in the early '90s? are they rare? seems like they were on nice, white paper stock. and did he manage to reprint the entire ec library? i know he hit most of it."
,Mothra67,2013-06-07T06:00Z,"From what I understand, those HC reprints were very limited edition, limited to only a few thousand, and VERY expensive, so it is safe to say they are rare"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T15:04Z,"yeah RC used to print some very nice 32-page reprintings of classic ECs, too. my local comic shop carried those but not the hardcovers.

still, in my mind that might be an option if one of the scan groups ever wants to try a complete EC library... gathering the HCs, although expensive, is probably more likely than quality scans of the 50's... damn you frederic wertham! lol"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T15:04Z,"and thanks again or weird science, i love these."
,scoobydoo_and_shaggy,2013-06-07T15:42Z,"Hi mothra67,
issue #1 and #12 of plastic man is not opening. i have used all three apps, comicrack, cdisplay and yacreader but its not opening. Even tried to rename the extension to rar , but while extracting the images an error msg says file is corrupted. Also plastic man issue #55 is missing."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-07T20:21Z,"hey scoobydoo_and_shaggy, this may or may not help you depending on how badly you want them, but you can fill in those missing quality PM issues from this torrent: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6673132/"
,Mothra67,2013-06-11T18:29Z,"OK guys, time to take this torrent down, as my share ratio is way up there, well over 20.  All you DLers please keep it going for all to enjoy"
