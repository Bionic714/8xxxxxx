Todd English's Olives, located in the heart of Manhattan, has just gone through a major renovation and needs a new executive chef to lead the re-launch. Anne brings a diverse group of candidates to compete for the position. The chefs are tested on their knowledge and use of spices and then told to dash to the farmers' market to create seasonal handmade pasta.

After both chefs struggle to keep up with the demands of a New York kitchen, Todd makes an unexpected decision and one chef walks away with the coveted title of executive chef.
