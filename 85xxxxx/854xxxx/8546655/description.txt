TheyΓÇÖre young, theyΓÇÖre brash, theyΓÇÖre smartΓÇöand theyΓÇÖre 77-million strong.
Generation Y is creating startups at an unprecedented rate, and their approach to business is unlike anything youΓÇÖve seen. The generation described by the media as spoiled, entitled, even narcissistic, is proving these notions false every day. Inspired by the rock-star entrepreneurs of previous generations and driven by a burning desire to control their own destinies, GenY is rewriting the entrepreneurial playbook one cool startup at a time.
Inc. magazine writer Donna Fenn interviewed more than 150 young CEOs to learn what makes them tick. While upstarts are motivated by similar aspirations of past generations, their way of doing business is radically differentΓÇöand itΓÇÖs changing the way everyone must do business now.
Upstarts examines and analyzes this entrepreneurial revolution to reveal eight critical lessons every entrepreneur and marketer must learn. Fenn describes a generation of entrepreneurs that is highly collaborative and team-oriented. ItΓÇÖs quick and alert when it comes to new technologies. ItΓÇÖs hell-bent on changing the world. And itΓÇÖs totally impatient with outmoded business models.
