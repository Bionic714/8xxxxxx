Naruto: Shipp┼½den Literally meaning "Naruto Hurricane Chronicles") is the anime adaptation of Part II of the manga, set two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha's defection and Naruto Uzumaki's training with Jiraiya and finally returned. The series is still being shown in Japan on TV-Tokyo. Viz distributes a subtitled version of the series on its website on Thursdays. The English dub episodes 1-97 aired on television on Disney XD from Wednesday, October 28, 2009 to Saturday, October 8, 2011. The dubbed episodes aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m before moving to Saturdays at 11:00 p.m. When the dubbed episodes aired on Wednesdays, they were edited and censored for blood, language, and anything suggestive. Though when the time slot had changed to 11:00 p.m on Saturday night, the edits were far less noticeable. The English Dub episodes now stream uncut on Neon Alley via Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. Uncut dubbed episodes are released on iTunes and Amazon Video on demand.
