This unique training is designed to teach you how to evoke trance conversationally, anytime, anywhere. Inside this training you will learn how most formal hypnotic processes and trainings are based around the ritual of "eyes-closed" processes. Yet you don't need to get someone to close their eyes or use a hypnotic voice tone in order to evoke trance!

Michael has been teaching and training people in hypnotic processes for over 20 years and ran his first conversational trance workshop in 1989. He co-delivered trainings with celebrity hypnotist Paul McKenna for many years along with Dr. Richard Bandler and works extensively in business contexts where being able to use trance processes is highly desirable. Time and again he has taken NLP and Hypnotic processes and figured out how to make the work really well in everyday conversational contexts and now you can learn how to use trance too, for everyday purposes without needling to do "formal" hypnosis.

This is an ideal skill to have if you work with friends, family, NLP or hypnosis averse clients or need to get results in non therapeutic contexts such as coaching, training, managing etc.
