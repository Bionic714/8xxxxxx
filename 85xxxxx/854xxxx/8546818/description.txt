Using NLP on Yourself To Create More Of The Life You Want is divided into two training modules:

The first is a 90 minute multi-part video training program in which you will learn specific inner mind set strategies and essential NLP tools for creating more of the life you want. You don't need to learn a ton of NLP to see dramatic results, use and apply what you learn here and you will have the core patterns on board from which you can start doing and experiencing new levels of happiness, productivity, control, and joy in your life.



   Learn how to apply these learning "rules of thumb" that when you keep front and centre will ensure you are always on an upward path to true mastery.

   What to do if a technique you try doesn't work. Learn the same attitude used by every top NLPer when the find a technique doesn't work and what to do next.

Next once you have a firm grip AND operationalised the inner game that enables you to then approach using the techniques you will receive an extensive 2:20 training on "Emotional Mastery: How To Manage Your State".
