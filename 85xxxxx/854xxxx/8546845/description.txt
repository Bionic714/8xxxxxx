This iso dont included:


* Browser Choice Screen Update KB976002 
  (Some people dosent want it and only want to uninstall it)

* Internet Explorer 9 
  (Almost all use another browser and only use internet explorer to 
  download a other browser,so it is IE that is available with vista with all updates in this iso.)

* .NET Framework 3.5 updates 
   (may cause problem for some users, but if you want it, just download it 
   with Windows Update or from Microsoft's site)

* Malicious Software Removal Tool KB890830 
  (You don't really need it since it's fairly useless, and is updated every month)

INSTALL NOTES 

1. Burn with imgburn or use a USB flash drive. 
                   
2. Install using your own key or 
   use some of the Activates/patch out there.

3. Have fun =) 
  


I make this release so peoble can repurpose an old system that can't run the latest, or for anyone to use for the purposes of learning and 
experimentation.

I make them for people who like to have 
updated versions of windows for when they install/re-install.

A lot of malware can be blocked by simply updating your system. 
Some malware goes undetected and goes to town on your system if you don't update your files.

And because not everyone has fast internet like me, i have very slow.

It would be best if microsoft did new version, 
in any case, if they release an updated version of windows when they stop support, like xp.
It would be great.

Like this:
Windows XP Service Pack 4
Windows XP Pro x64 Service Pack 3
Windows Vista service Pack 3
                   
"If anyone is willing to donate $ or parts please PM me."
