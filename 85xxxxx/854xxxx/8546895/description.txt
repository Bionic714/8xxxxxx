As one the largest productions to date, this Wicked Pictures' blockbuster has it all! Action... Romance... Drama... Suspense... and even a little bit of Comedy! Okay, a whole lot of comedy! Join award winning writer/director Stormy Daniels as she leads you on the wildest and most hilarious adventure in the history of adult cinema. With the head of the CIA (Randy Spears) presumed dead and word of an impending terrorist attack lead by the evil Hussein (Ron Jeremy), the fate of the world rests in the hands of two unlikely and extremely unskilled heroes. Does a secretary (Stormy Daniels) and her wannabe agent husband (Steven St. Croix) have what it takes to put aside their numerous marital issues and travel overseas to put an end to Hussein's quest for total world domination...and his ridiculous get rich quick ideas? With the help of two no-nonsense British agents Jacks and Watson, some beautiful and horny harem girls, and one ornery camel, the "heroes" embark on a sex-crazed and explosion-filled expedition into hostile territory.
