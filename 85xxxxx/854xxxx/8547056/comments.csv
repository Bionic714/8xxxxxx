[V],globeplus,2013-06-06T21:38Z,"Hi new movie fans and this is the first camera to this movie and the original cam was worked with Virtual Dub Artwork removing some few seconds on the beggining with some borring publicity and an entedious logo that was present on the screen all the movie, was masked correctly better as possible under the circunstances giving a normal viewing without nothing really borring the screen during the view ... happy movies to all of you ...

,captainbarbossa,2013-06-07T10:12Z,"Globe I just want to see even though the quality isn't great, you saw how bad the original was with that stupid fucking logo and then went out of your way to make the best copy you could with that annoying original copy. THANK YOU. Some of these dicks don't understand you didn't have to do shit, or any of this ever. Its the best copy out now. Thanks."
[V],globeplus,2013-06-07T14:15Z,"To captainbarbossa : thank you for your comment and it is because users like you that i don´t mind to do the best possible work , so let´s think together like this : we got a cam copy with about 10 seconds of borring publicity at the start and a borring logo all the movie and itis the only cam available for the moment so what we do ?... remove the starting publicity and mask in black the borring logo , it is the best work possible under the circunstances , i didn´t maked the cam and introduced that kind of things but the true is that it is the only cam unfornatly at this moment in time and certainly as all of you i want better cam or dvdrip copys soon as possible , this is just the momet in time that we have to live sometimes depending in how it is the original cam copy . See you and all of you around here at piratebay and it is beeing true that in more new cams lately it is beeing needed correction work of the cams , in my last 3 cam files just look what i did : on the first i needed to put the picture in fullscreen , got 30 or more percent with blackscreen all the movie , on the second i correct the angle of the camera view , the viewer was watching the picture with inclination and seeing the theatre during all the movie , i correct that showing only the movie and now this one with borring publicity at the start and with an entedious logo that really put the viewer borred during the movie and ithe best option was the mask of the logo because i don´t guess the picture behind the logo as you can imagine ... so happy movies to everyone and we keep leaving with what it is available for this type of files ..."
,dash34,2013-06-07T17:52Z,"Still fuck u globe, take a knife n shove it up your ass!! lol"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-07T19:25Z,"To dash34 : watch your language ok ? at least read what the others have to say and first comes this type of cams then the better copys , see if you understand the way that this files comes available all right? and if you can do better do it don´t implicate with the others work because with the circunstances that i get the cams you simply can´t get better than this , got it ? well , i wish nice movie files to all of you and of course it is always more pratic beeing criticising without no compreension then just do something to improve what is available ... if you don´t like the way that the first cams for the new movies are presented , don´t download because one thing is for shore : many times the first cams sucks ok ? and everybody knows it ... happy movies to all of you ..."
,ZyranX,2013-06-07T22:40Z,Thank you for trying watched the whole movie it was better than some of the others uploaded :) 
,digitalepisode,2013-06-08T01:12Z,"I for one, appreciate the effort Globe.  At least you made the crap cam watchable for me.  Keep up the good work and remember...  Sticks and stones.  You are still da man!"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-08T12:15Z,"Thank you for the latest comments and basically we have to live with what it is available, it is a fact that all of us want better copys as possible for the new movies but the true is that the new cams is always a mystery , i respect the difficulties from the cams shooting but in some ocasions i think to myself that was nice if them knows something about video editing artwork to put the shooted cams better as possible for watching but sometimes that don´t happen and we thanks anyway the effort of the shooting ... it is like that and in every single new cam the possibilities about the general condition of the movie shooting can change but always hoping that they can be better as possible ... happy movies to all of you ..."
,Zergborgcolective,2013-06-08T13:17Z,"if u dont want to watch cams ,go to cinema,but if u want it for free,shut ur mouths and enjoy

or u can wait until a better version comes out 

tx globe "
,dash34,2013-06-08T16:22Z,"As I said u talking a lot bot,  take a knife n shove it up your ass!! lol  

This movie competes with inception, I watched it today at the theatre, fucking awesome movie loved it ""period"" . Wow after long time what a great movie! Loved the ending like everybody what's something so different to happen and that's exactly what happens... lotta twists and stuff,,,,,

So I am not talking trash, i dont work on this stuff I work good on what I do! If u work on this then work good or by self respect and integrity better stop, everyone should compete with themselves thinking others mite get better than me, so I better start working better n better, its a good logic for all!"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-08T19:43Z,"To dash34 . i am happy that you gone to cinema and like it , i think that it is positive and optional for any movie file user, we are talking here about home video files you can´t take the cinema screen to home and start watching again anyway, so this home video cams still positive for shore , i am writing this comment because you still making an effort for don´t recognise how the cam files works , we that like to watch at home when we got the opportunity depends on the quality of the cams specially if theyare new are no other versions available ... see if you understand the possible context to watch this type of files , i don´t understand for shore what you are implicating because you simply don´t make too much sense ... if for one side everyone understand that the possible cam files can sucks sometimes , for other side no one understands what you are complaining for ... because if you understand how this cam files works and his availaibility you certainly don´t recriminate best possible work under the circunstances and please be more respectfull to the uploaders ok? if not it is asking too much of course ... well happy movies to you at home or in the cinema and please still beeing good in whatever you do , that certainly not a bad thing ... ok, that´s all and happy movie files to all of you ..."
,dash34,2013-06-08T21:30Z,blah blah!! Action speaks louder than words lol !!
,dash34,2013-06-08T21:38Z,"don't argue, just move on ... its for the work, yes its bad for now, so not personally anything to you so chill :)"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-08T22:12Z,"To dash34 : great movie my friend, you for an instant don´t have a camera and disponibility to go to the cinema shoot the movie ? i am only joking with you ... chill out you too and happy movies everyone ..."
,bobbymagee41,2013-06-08T23:10Z,"Then why do you claim it is a cam upload when it is just a copy of one. I come in here to read comments on the upload not comments about the comments, this is so fucking retarded. I'm so tired of it. If you want to upload a cam, go take a cam shot of the movie first, or state that you copied one that's already on here and cleaned it a little. Like out front, not in here, like call it a cleaned up cam or something. This room is for A? V? That's it can everyone just shut the fuck up."
,bobbymagee41,2013-06-08T23:13Z,"And then all these people licking your asshole because you blocked out a logo....PLEASE!!!! I""M PULLING THE HAIR OUT OF MY HEAD!!!!"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-08T23:45Z,To bobbymagee41 : hi there wherever you are and maybe it is nothing special but please be my guest and download the other copy with the logo and watch and then take your own conclusions because after 10 to 15 minutes watching the other one you will be running to ask : where is the one without the logo ? i need her ... Trust me !!! The true is we always need a little bit luck with the first cams for the new movies and it is no way around that ... happy movies to everyone ...
,davidcal,2013-06-09T04:21Z,"It's funny because I don't see any of these fucking assholes that are leaving rude comments, uploading shit for anyone... Goddamn leechers... I don't upload but I also don't complain and I also seed anything I download. The last 2 copies of this movie did suck, but I appreciate if someone took the time to try to make it better, so I am gonna check it out. It's because of assholes like some of the faggots posting here that people stop uploading stuff... So fuck off and go pay to see it you cheap pricks"
,dash34,2013-06-09T09:53Z,"V:1, A:0 . Vomiting print, worst in the world!!"
,dash34,2013-06-09T11:16Z,"Shove a knife up ur ass globe bastard, because of your work... Better retire ur a shame! Dont shame ur family tht u do shit work, u dont belong here"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-09T13:15Z,"To dash34 : you need quickly a psychiatric and certainly who looks that don´t belongs here it is you with your attitude with the uploaders and with the effort no matter what to beeing recriminating the others work , i hope that no matter what you do you don´t have hassles like you around your work to start criticising and borring your work no matter what , it is not that really borring but sucks and don´t take anywhere and i have an advice to you : start beeing more compreensive and correct or with me you don´t talk anymore ... or maybe with anyone else ...
Happy movies to all of you ..."
,dash34,2013-06-09T14:05Z,Shove a swiss army knife up ur ass globe bastard!
,exdous69,2013-06-09T21:08Z,"wow some people... its not the best copy, but you see CAM in the title. wTf do you expect? blu ray quality? are you kidding me? if you fucks can do ANY better, do it. otherwise shut the fuck up and move on. @globeplus... thank you for all your hard work. dont let these inbred fucks get to you. 

peace and love from eugene oregon"
[V],globeplus,2013-06-09T22:46Z,"To exdous69 : thank you for your comment wherever you are and you certainly welcome to this comments , you are absolutly right about your analysis to this type of files, of course that we all liked to have bluray or dvd rips quick as possible specially for the new great movies but unfornatly we have to accept what is available and of course in this case and this is just another case, we once more can wish to expect a little bit better at least print for this movie but i still searching everywhere in my research fonts and i have to say that the possibility to a new really good copy for this movie still looking farway, because i am not seeing an effort for a new cam and worst than that i am checking hours after hours new links to the already available cam version of this movie , in my borring research i found a new tip for this only available cam copy and it is the next thing : the borring logo that i masked in black on this file can improve ... how? making the black points or colours on the logo or mask beeing transparent and the great discover if you can call that is that the movie behind the logo or the black mask that makes part to the all screen acts with naturality as possible on the screen , what this means ? means that more 95% of the area of the screen with logo or mask get total normality with the original cam picture for more surprising that can sounds ... the logo area of the movie with this transparency work leaves the picture almost really without a clue of an existence of a logo or a mask and this is true , just a really small blur that is transparent and only in a short area of the logo, making the area looks like a small brightness issue that doesn´t matter and the viewer not even for an instant get the perception that a logo was in there because the banal transparency of the logo area, i still waiting for a new copy but please tell me your opinion about a version for this movie with the area of the logo acting really with transparency with the normal movie going like never had a logo in there before ... i am my friend sometimes beeing surprised with some great software that i got the luck to knows times to times that can make anyone makes great work with videos for example even if the user don´t have too much experience as that with video editing artwork, a big thanks to all the software houses for really working products that can make any user happy, well if you want or anyone else to give an opinion about a new file with no logo but the same shooting cam of course, please be my guest to use this comments to talk about it ... from me i still my research in wherever for this movie but for the moment the best option looks what i said about the logo area with transparency making the viewer not even thinking about a logo existance ... happy movies to all of you and we see all each other here at piratebay ...
