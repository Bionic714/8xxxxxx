TRAIN LIKE A FIGHTER
Build a Fighter's Body aims to pack all the professional fighting expertise it can into one informative and easy-to-use book.

Then, once you're in shape, you can tweak your training with moves, routines and tricks from top-level athletes and coaches. There's also advice on how to tailor your diet to your new training plan, and how to improve your recovery ? which is just as vital as training hard. Whether you want to fight or you're after a fighter's body, there's something for you inside.
