In jQuery Essential Training, Microsoft professional Joe Marini presents the power of the jQuery library, an open-source JavaScript project that greatly simplifies the process of adding advanced functionality to web sites. Joe teaches how to use these new features to build pages that work across browsers with the functionality that today's users (and clients) are looking for, from complex animation effects to dynamic page formatting.

Exercise files accompany the course.
