Cheers mate !!!"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-07T21:38Z,"Strictly crop, no animals...

doing extras on a bluray is a extremely difficult task if you want them done properly.... Usually I can do the shorts, sometimes do with the animated movies.

But honestly don't plan on doing them simply because i'm still backlogged a lot of movies.

Lots of things to pay for first prior to investing in buying blurays..  blurays are not very nourishing."
,eroticburps,2013-06-07T23:12Z,"i hope you continue encoding movies like your other daily chores..
:)"
