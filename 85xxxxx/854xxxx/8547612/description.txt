Info.................: 
Forensic Files is a documentary-style show which reveals how 
forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious 
accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show is 
broadcast on truTV, narrated by Peter Thomas, and produced by 
Medstar Television, in association with truTV Original 
Productions. It has broadcast over 300 episodes so far since 
its debut on TLC in 1996 as Medical Detectives.

The show helped pioneer documentary style crime-science shows.
The show's official web site says it profiles "puzzling, often
baffling cases whose riddles are ultimately solved by forensic
detection." The cases and people are real. Perhaps 
surprisingly, DNA testing is rarely focused on. While 
ballistics, hair analysis, and fingerprint comparisons do turn
up, the show seems to prefer unusual evidence such as animal 
hairs, plant analysis, or arson investigation. Scientists and 
forensic experts in many fields are interviewed.

Not every case is a crime. In some cases, the investigation 
reveals that suspects are innocent, and the death was an 
accident or suicide. Several shows have profiled people who 
have been jailed for or convicted of a crime, and who were 
ultimately exonerated by forensic evidence.
