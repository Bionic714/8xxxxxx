Faye Coulman reviews Judas PriestΓÇÿs new live DVD ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ and we speak to the metal god himself, Rob Halford, about picking the ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ setlist and marking the end of a chapter.
Reliving the electrifying thrills and spills of a historic rock show in an air-conditioned cinema aisle may be considered second-rate entertainment to the mind of any right-thinking metal maniac. But as a band whose every blistering riff and leather-clad swagger looms large with the otherworldly essence of heavy metal, the theatrical vision with which Judas PriestΓÇÖs closing ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ date is captured only heightens their already towering stage presence.

In a sustained, 142-minute assault on the senses that sees these genre-forging Brits revisit their immense 14-album discography, this rare performance is rendered with all the explosive audio and acrobatic camera angles youΓÇÖd expect of such an outing. But with every era of Judas PriestΓÇÖs 40-year career being recreated in the iconic visuals that define each influential album, itΓÇÖs clear that ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ is no simple retrospective and, as such demands ample cinematic imagination. With its lingering close-ups and whirling overhead shots being ignited in a white-hot haze of light, ΓÇÿStarbreakerΓÇÖ is particularly abuzz with fan euphoria, with Rob HalfordΓÇÖs operatic pipes ricocheting off expansive surround sound audio.

Judas PriestΓÇÖs legendary musicianship is always a supreme spectacle to behold in any medium, but never before has the passion and pageantry of their sound been so vividly brought to life until now.
[4/5] Faye Coulman

Because ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ is such a monumental milestone for Judas Priest, marking their 40th anniversary as recording artists, we couldnΓÇÖt turn down the opportunity to talk to the metal god himself, Rob Halford, about ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ.
The ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ set covers every era of Priest, what went into picking the setlist?
ΓÇ£I hadnΓÇÖt really listened to PriestΓÇÖs [back catalogue] completely for the longest time so I literally played everything, absolutely every track and [laughs] you surprise yourself, ΓÇÿoh that was a good one, iΓÇÖd forgot about thatΓÇÖ, ΓÇÿcos it was buried on side two of ΓÇÿPoint Of EntryΓÇÖ or whatever. And then, of course, youΓÇÖve got to have a track from ΓÇÿPainkillerΓÇÖ which you can play live, every track off ΓÇÿBritish SteelΓÇÖ which you could play live, ΓÇÿScreaming For VengeanceΓÇÖ and on and on and on.ΓÇ¥
Is it fair to say that the ΓÇÿEpitaphΓÇÖ tour, and this DVD, marks the end of a chapter for Priest?
ΓÇ£Just in one small respect, itΓÇÖs not the end of Judas Priest by any stretch of the imagination; weΓÇÖre in the studio now as we speak tracking all of the new material; weΓÇÖre just cutting back a little bit so we can still get out there and do the great shows that we want to do. As a 52-year-old metal head [laughs], going out doing what I need to do as a singer and as a performer, I can still do it and I love to do it. I just want to be able to go out there and not look sad and punch drunk and I think that youΓÇÖve just kind of look at what you need to do to make sure that when people see you, they go ΓÇÿyeah, theyΓÇÖre as good as theyΓÇÖve ever beenΓÇÖ.ΓÇ¥
