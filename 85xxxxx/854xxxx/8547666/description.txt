Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, June 6 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Infowars officially kicks off coverage of Bilderberg's 2013 meeting which starts today in Watford, England, as hundreds of protestors descend upon designated free speech zones cordoned off by a massive ring of steel and patrolled by tax payer funded police. 

We'll also be getting live up to the minute updates from Alex and crew on the overt Bilderberg police state, and report any sightings of so-called elite touring the grounds of the Grove hotel. 

Infowars Nightly News anchor David Knight holds down the Austin, Texas command base, discussing Obama's latest scandal -- the NSA's collection of Verizon customers' call data, and a drone operator's account of being haunted by the deaths of thousands he's remotely killed. 

Max Keiser joins Alex for much of the show.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
