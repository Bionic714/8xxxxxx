Two survivors of a global catastrophe disguise themselves as corpses to survive in a land of the walking dead.

From the mind of Mike Richardson (The Mask; The Secret) comes this hilariously frightening tale of Straw and Whip, two slackers who have lived through a plague that's left the world with seven billion brain-hungry zombies. Life is tough as they try to keep up the appearance of being like the rest of the decomposing masses, and things heat up when a damsel in distress needs their help. Will they blow their cover for a beautiful young girl, or sacrifice her in the name of rock and roll?

Three-issue series with art by Ben Stenbeck, and covers by legendary Richard Corben, making zombies fun again.

Two boys, a girl, and seven billion living dead.
