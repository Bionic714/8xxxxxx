,SeaDoggie73,2013-06-10T00:38Z,"Thanks for the upload,  I am a big fan of the enderverse series of books. If anyone knows of a torrent of this broken into smaller files could you post a link. 500+ MB per file is way more than I am used to, and with my net connection will be a month before I can get started on the book. Lol"
,duhkeyluv,2013-06-11T04:09Z,"Sorry, I compressed and uploaded it as I got it =/ it was 1 gig per file raw.  Didn't know there was a demand for smaller files, I'll look into splitting them up by chapter for ya."
,duhkeyluv,2013-06-11T07:44Z,"Ok, uploaded another torrent of it broken up by chapters.  I'll try and seed it, but I'm not on constantly =/ http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8563042"
