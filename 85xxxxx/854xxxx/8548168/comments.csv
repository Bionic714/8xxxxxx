,sistromo,2013-06-08T00:44Z,I hope somebody is still seeding this terrific collection.
,brdigetrlol,2013-06-08T03:42Z,"I'm still seeding. My connection is rather slow at the moment, however, so I apologize for that. But I assure that this torrent isn't dead."
,adrenergic,2013-06-10T08:40Z,"@brdigetrlol - thanks for the beautiful upload. sharing is caring. I just wanna know if this is a compilation of other existing torrents. because I have Oxford/Cambridge & Other Univ. Presses already with me. So let me know, if it is something different, so that I can try to download it OR is it the same. Thanks, bro! & once again, Great Work =]"
,brdigetrlol,2013-06-10T21:49Z,"Unfortunately, I'm not sure. I downloaded these all together awhile ago and I didn't see this in particular available elsewhere so I decided to upload it here. I checked some of the other torrents for you and it looks like if you have all of the other available torrents, then there will be quite a few duplicates, but there were a few books that I couldn't find. Sorry I can't be of more help than that."
