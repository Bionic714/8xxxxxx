Right? lol, I figured it out this semester.  Pretty sure it's awesome, so I thought I'd share it with the rest of the student body! :P"

,erica46829,2013-06-07T06:48Z,"I like how you assume it's a scam before you even read the damn thing... don't even give it a chance.  If I wanted to scam you, then I wouldn't put my name on it.

Read the coursesmart policy, and my txt file... I'm pretty sure you'll understand that it's legit!"
,Sapphyreopal5,2013-06-07T18:26Z,"I did something like this for a coursesmart book (am about 95% sure it was a coursesmart book) and is actually one of my torrents (a health book). I was on a 3 week trial and I ended up printing all sections via pdf then combining all of the sections and putting them into chapters, then combined all the chapters and into the book. 
It was not the funnest thing to do and was somewhat time consuming (not to mention the printing option would stop working so I'd have to log out and then re-log back in or would do more the next day or something); however, I got a free book out of this. This really is NOT a scam and is a very legit method of getting a free book.  That is, if book companies don't start changing their policies anytime soon ha ha. "
