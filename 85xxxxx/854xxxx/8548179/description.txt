I'm a student, and I figured out how to get free ebooks from coursesmart.  I don't have hundreds of dollars to dish out on ebooks to "rent them", and I certainly don't have the money to purchase a textbook when each textbook runs up 100+ dollars a piece!  Textbook companies rearrange their text and chapters, and change some of the problems, to make more money on essentially the same book with a new look to it.  

This is my way of saying Free Education for all! Stick it to the man! Download the .txt file... I promise: NO surveys, NO bullshit.  Here is my "Coursesmart Solution"!

I encourage you to spread the books you acquire to other students (free of charge of course)!

Please leave a comment below with feedback... if you have a better way of doing this, let me know! If you think it's bullshit, and that I'm encouraging thievery, so be it... Don't bother if you don't like it!
