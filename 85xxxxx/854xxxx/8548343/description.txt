Honey is a lot like olive oil; how do you know what type to select from the farmers' market or the store shelf? Are all honey bears created equal? What makes one variety of honey different from another? Which is better for baking and which is best for savory dishes?

Why is one darker than another in color, what does that mean? All these questions and more will be answered in Taste of Honey.
