6th Season -- from the fall of 1955

It's edited at 44 minutes with a few songs removed... and a 
few seconds of dialog is missing in the second sketch, but nothing major.

There is also a 52 minute version with those dated songs, but the 
film quality is MUCH better here so you've come to the right place!

There are more Colgate Comedy Hours with Martin & Lewis, 
Abbott & Costello, Donald O' Connor, and other hosts but the video
quality is terrible so I passed on those. You can find them on 
You Tube and
