When you enter the complex mind of Monica English, there's no telling. A seemingly average woman trapped in an unremarkable existence, Monica awakens one morning with the sudden power to turn her dull life around and grasp the fantasies that have always eluded her. Crossing the thin line that separates dreams from reality, Monica leaves a trail of sexual havoc in her wake as she turns the lives of everyone around her upside down. But is Monica really in control--or just spiraling out of it? Chloe turns in an erotically haunting performance as a woman possessed by her desires in this spellbinding portrait of sexuality and psychosis from award-winning director Antonio Passolini.
