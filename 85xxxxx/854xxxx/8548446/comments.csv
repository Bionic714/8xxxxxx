,beaujoulais,2013-06-09T12:31Z,"Hi lordsergius, the most essential thing is to keep the seeds alive. If it was one of your origins be proud of re-seeding - even if it is a reproduction. Hope your original seeds are still alive. I'll dig there for some jewels in the next few days. 1,000,000 thanks to you! Tom B. "
