Against the Wall (Maverick Montana #1) by Rebecca Zanetti (March 25th 2013)

Never challenge a cowboy in the courtroomΓÇª

Surveying the proposed site for a high-end golf course should have been a breeze for spunky Landscape Architect Sophie Smith. But when this born-and-bred city girl is suddenlyΓÇöand quite literallyΓÇöswept off her feet by a sexy cowboy on horseback, she realizes that the country life has some serious (and seriously steamy!) possibilities. That is, until she finds out exactly who her smokinΓÇÖ-hot wrangler really is.

Cowboy and Tribal lawyer Jake Lodge is desperately trying to block the development. And if that means playing hardballΓÇöand being every inch the shark lawyerΓÇöso be it. But Sophie is a distraction he didnΓÇÖt expect. A distraction that makes his blood burn.

Two different worlds. Two opposing sides. And when they finally give into the exquisite temptation, the consequences will shake the foundations of both of their livesΓÇª

Under the Covers (Maverick Montana #2) by Rebecca Zanetti (May 27th 2013)

Opposites donΓÇÖt attract. They ignite.

The small Montana town near the Kooskia reserve seemed like the perfect place for Juliet Montgomery to hide from her not-so-law-abiding family. But when her peace is shattered by a break-in and threatening phone calls, itΓÇÖs clear someone back in New York knows where she is. ItΓÇÖs time to plan her getaway, and fastΓÇöbut first, she needs to tie up a few loose ends. Namely, finding out exactly what the townΓÇÖs sexy cowboy sheriff is hiding in his holster...

Sheriff Quinn Lodge has enough demons of his own to know when someoneΓÇÖs hiding something. Clearly, he needs to do a thorough investigation to uncover whatΓÇÖs beneath JulietΓÇÖs uptight, city-girl exteriorΓÇöpreferably one piece of clothing at a time. But when their chemistry goes from fizzy to full-on explosive, things start getting complicated. How can Juliet stay beneath the covers with Quinn, when doing so means blowing her cover?


Seed and Enjoy!
