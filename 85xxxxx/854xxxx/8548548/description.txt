"Heavenly Hostess"

When Tom reveals that he's up for a big
promotion, Beth decides to host a
dinner party for his boss Stephanie
(Debra Wilson) and her officious
assistant Randall (Michael McDonald)
but she becomes distracted by a garage
sale she thought she had cancelled. To
make matters worse, she receives a
divine message to get rid of many of
their worldly possessions at the sale
so by the time everyone arrives, there
is not much left of the family dining
room. Luckily for Beth, Tom's boss is a
woman who also knows a thing or two
about speaking with the Lord
