This well-wrought romance takes place in Lancashire, England in an industrial area where Vic (Alan Bates) and Ingrid (June Ritchie) work in the same factory. He is a draftsman who wants only a physical relationship with the woman of his choice (Ingrid), and she is a typist who wants true love with the man she is interested in (Vic). In carefully handled scenes throughout, Vic and Ingrid get together but with consequences neither could have foreseen. Ingrid becomes pregnant, and that one indisputable fact tests the mettle of their relationship more than anything else they could have imagined.
