The USG Ishimura, the most famous of the Planet-Cracker class starships, is flung from orbit around Aegis VII after the disastrous events of Dead Space. It is lost somewhere in deep space, and both the Government and a powerful religious sect called "Church of Unitology" believe it may still hold the Red Marker, an alien artifact that promises great power for either side, and both will stop at nothing to reach it first!
