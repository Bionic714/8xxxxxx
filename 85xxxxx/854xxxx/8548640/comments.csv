HOW TO INSTALL =================================================

**The following was tested using 32-bit Windows XP Pro.**

1. Burn or mount first disk ""FLIGHT_II.iso"". Note that these are disk images and must be burned, as images, with the proper program, to work! Don't just burn the file onto a CD. Daemon Tools & Alcohol 120% are Windows programs that will allow you to mount the images without burning a CD.

2. Run installer (D:/setup.exe)

3. Burn or mount second disk, when prompted by the setup program. Disk II is ""FLIGHT_II_II.iso""

4. Play game! There is no copy protection, thankfully. But it does read a lot of data from the second CD so it needs to be mounted to run the game. If you are having issues with the game [not related to running too new of an OS], check out the installed readme and/or included PDF manual, they are very informative and comprehensive.
