For those of you who don't know Dispatch, they are arguably the most successful indie band of all time. As of June 2013, they have released five studio albums, two EPs, and four live albums. The best way I can describe their sound is a mix between rock, acoustic, folk, reggae, funk, and hip/hop. Although just about every song they have ever released is great, they are most well-known for [i]The General[/i].

These are the original [i]All Points Bulletin[/i] concert CDs (ripped at 320kbps bitrate) and DVD (untouched). If you want to burn the DVD to a disc, you will either need a DVD-DL, or you'll need to use a program like DVD Shrink to compress video and remove unwanted titles/tracks.

[b]PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE:[/b] If you like these CDs and DVD, consider buying them and/or other Dispatch albums/DVDs. Remember, they are an indie band, and they really rely on their fans to keep them going. They originally got big through people
sharing their music on Napster, and they have acknowledged that. In the early days of P2P filesharing, they took a stance in support of it. They give so much back to their fans and to various charities. If you like their music, please give a little back to them.

Shamelessly copied from Wikipedia:

All Points Bulletin is a 2004 live album by American indie/roots folk band Dispatch. Much like their previous live album Gut the Van, the album was released onto two discs. The first is entitled "Somerville" and captures the band's intimate "warm-up" gig prior to their free performance to approximately 110,000 fans on the second disc, entitled "Hatch Shell." The purchase of the double album also includes a DVD recording of both performances.
