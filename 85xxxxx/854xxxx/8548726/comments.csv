Anyone downloaded? what is it?"
,BrezNJ,2013-06-07T12:41Z,It's an Adult Swim comedy/parody show. The only part I saw from last year was a scene-for-scene parody of the opening credits of SIMON & SIMON by Adam Scott and Jon Hamm. The version I saw showed the original and the parody side by side and it was interesting. This year they are doing a HART TO HART version with Scott and Amy Poehler. I don't know what else was in the remaining 9 minutes of episode 1.
