Those who donΓÇÖt learn from history are condemned to repeat it. From the Stone Age to 
the information age, the undead have threatened to engulf the human race. TheyΓÇÖre coming. TheyΓÇÖre hungry. DonΓÇÖt wait for them to come to you! This is the graphic novel the fans demanded: major zombie attacks from the dawn of humanity. On the African savannas, against the legions of ancient Rome, on the high seas with Francis Drake . . . every civilization has faced them. Here are the grisly and heroic storiesΓÇôcomplete with eye-popping artwork that pulsates with the hideous faces of the undead. Organize before they rise! Scripted by the worldΓÇÖs leading zombie authority, Max Brooks, Recorded Attacks reveals how other eras and cultures have dealt withΓÇôand survivedΓÇôthe ancient viral plague. By immersing ourselves in past horror we may yet prevail over the coming outbreak in our time.
