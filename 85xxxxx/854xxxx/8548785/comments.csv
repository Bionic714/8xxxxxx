I don't know about you, but I can download from their stream player even after the shows have aired. Ed Schultz (with Jeff Santos filling in this week) starts at 6 minutes and 40 seconds into each hour."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-07T16:31Z,Those shows on KCAA are unfortunately at 24K and lower audio quality is evident... Also they only have 1 and sometimes 2 hours of 3 hour shows posted.
[T],480v,2013-06-09T22:20Z,"I know. Progressive Voices (tunein) has crappy sound. All those promotions saying ""CD-like"" digital quality sound were bullshit."
[T],480v,2013-06-09T22:49Z,"You can find a ""small"" handful of radio stations here & there broadcasting liberal shows if you search hard enough.  FYI, Tunein isn't very helpful in searching for them either. 

The unfortunate reality is they all suffer from very low bitrate. I wouldn't be surprised if these stations were nothing more than a guy in his garage. 

The Liberal viewpoint isn't given a fair playing field to thrive. If it happens to be successful ...what does Clear Channel do? Kill it. remember KPOJ in Portland? How about CBS radio in Seattle? Or how about their attempt to switch the liberal format (Green960) to rightwing in San Francisco. People made such a fuss they decided to switch to rightwing anyway, BUT leave just a couple liberal shows as proof it's fair? Give me a fucking break. It is so blatant, It makes me.... whatever."
