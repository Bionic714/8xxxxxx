Confirmed. Lucky Patcher doesn't work for this game. Not sure why it worked for me the first time when I tested it?

Anyway,
TheC2G is right. You need modded play store by chelpus:

Root your phone, download this, copy over to your device, run the APK, run the program once and it will ""tweak"" the GPlay store. I have used this ""tweak"" for a couple weeks now, with no issues, besides awesomeness."
