I am uploading this for you guys because I looked everywhere for this album after hearing "Southern Gothic" and could not find it. Not sure if it's an iTunes exclusive or not but eitherway...It's not anymore ;)

Album was purchased on iTunes and ran through an mp3 converter in order to be able to be played on anybodys computer. (Not exactly how it sounded in my head, but you get the picture. Please enjoy and seed
