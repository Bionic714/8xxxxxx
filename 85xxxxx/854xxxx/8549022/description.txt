Drummer Sunny MurrayΓÇÖs sound of breaking glass is still shattering what passed
as conventional jazz wisdom over 40 years ago, when he broke onto the New York
scene with Cecil Taylor and, most importantly, Albert Ayler. On this two-volume
set, Murray not only demonstrates that he can still crash and bang with
abandon, but that he can also sharpen his idiosyncratic musicality to
surprisingly fine points. Subsequently, these recordings buttress the assertion
that Murray is the most original stylist since Kenny Clarke. Murray is heard
with five different groups, the very high common denominator being reed player
Sabir Mateen, one of the more powerful underground forces on the US
scene. vol. I may garner more initial buzz, since, in addition to a strong
duet, it includes four trios with pianist Dave Burrell and two tracks with
bassist Alan Silva in a quartet rounded out by saxophonist Louis
Belogenis. Though vol. II does not feature such Fire Music legends, it features
two notable improvisers, reed player Oluyemi Thomas and pianist John Blum, who
more than pass muster in respective trios with Murray and Mateen.
