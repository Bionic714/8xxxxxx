[V],HighCode,2013-06-08T08:56Z,"If someone got the full copy of ""Planet of the Apes duology (2001, 2011) 1080p DTS multisub GER HUN HighCode"" would be great if would seed a little. 
Everyone is stuck at 96.5 % and I lost my copy on  a faulty hard disk so I can't help. Thanks in advance."

Thanks for all your uploads!
Do you know when you're going to re-upload the first Terminator in its remastered version ?"
[V],HighCode,2013-06-09T12:58Z,"@Hex86
thx for reminding me, I forgot about it. I'll re-upload again the pack with ""The Terminator (1984) Remastered"" + deleted scenes. Weird that I haven't seen a genuine remastered BDRip anywhere. The ones that claim they are remastered they are not! The 2006 release is NOT remastered. Release date of remastered is Feb 19 2013.

,Hex86,2013-06-09T13:37Z,"I didn't heard about the release from Feb 19 2013 but in september 2012 came this release :

And the differences between the old releases and this one are huge! I tought you were talking about this one. Too bad the images links don't work anymore... but trust me the image was far better than every previous release! So if you're telling me that there is a new one even better, I just can wait to see that in 1080p ! :)"
