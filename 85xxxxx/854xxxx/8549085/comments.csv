[V],psspss,2013-06-08T08:27Z,"i see someone add a new source of the move but

has hard subs in spanish and real video format

i know theres a proper english DVD mkv rip floating about so some will have it 

but the movie wasnt so great .. effects sucked and kinda boring 

cant wait for the new remake based on the new book interrupted journey but this movie is worth watching as citizen hearing night lecture refers to it and also a recent C2Cam episode"

they just dont use all the tools.

ghost box talkers they never seem to try out


I like to see some build a MIL meter QWERTY keyboard. with be letters.. or perhaps have the alphabet rotating on a screen and the mil device and trigger
the letter selection. liek a electronic weegee board

if I ghost can trigger the lights.. and meant to be intellgient then surely they could write out words"
