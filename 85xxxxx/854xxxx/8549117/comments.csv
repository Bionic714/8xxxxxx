@skj88 [regarding comment posted in previous week's listing]

@skj88

Okay, that seems reasonable enough. I was not aware of this service. Now that you mention it, I have seen this naming convention elsewhere, but didn't regard it with any special significance.

I will adopt the filename convention you specify starting with the next show after June 6.

Question: is it permitted to have additional filename characters after the date, and if so what is the preferred way to set that off from the date portion? (e.g. provide an example using a filename I've already listed, reformatted in full into a format suitable for your system.)

Would you agree that trying to rename/repost listings for everything that's already gone up would be too much to bother with?

I'm pressed for time (offline) with the June 6 listing, so I cannot accommodate with this listing."
