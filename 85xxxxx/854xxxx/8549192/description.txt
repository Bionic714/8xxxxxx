The NRMΓÇÖs Great Gathering assembled all six remaining Class A4s reunited and on display to the general public for a limited time, and the Class A4 Pacifics for Train Simulator recreates this unique gathering and the locomotives in the liveries they will be displayed in. They feature with and without their famous aerodynamic side fairings and a special Speed Test scenario between two fixed points on the London to Brighton route, giving you the opportunity to attempt Mallards record breaking

The Class A4 Pacifics are also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the locomotives on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator.
