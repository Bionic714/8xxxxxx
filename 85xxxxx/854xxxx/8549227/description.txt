It's 1910 and we're in Banbury church hall at the
Banbury Intricate Craft Circle. Margaret has been
to London and discovered the Women's Suffrage
movement so she decides they need to set up their
own movement and The Banbury Intricate Craft Circle
becomes the hilariously ineffectual Banbury Intricate
Craft Circle Politely Request Women's Suffrage.
