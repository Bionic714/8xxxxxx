,zakimar5,2013-06-07T16:19Z,Apparently this is really gory crap. Thanks for the warning from IMDB.
,MattP598,2013-06-07T17:22Z,"It currently has a 7.6 from 364 users on IMDB.  That is actually a really good score on there.  I haven't watched it yet so I can't say, but I don't know where you came up with crap from IMDB with that score."
,soletar,2013-06-07T17:29Z,"if this copy is clear, then this is the most amazing upload i have ever seen.....this film was just released and it is already available....

,Pdid,2013-06-07T23:11Z,@Zakimar-Can you read reviews? Or are you using some other IMDB site? Lol Says it's a good movie from everything I actually read...

I found both movies quite entertaining. The first one was a little better though."
,diabollos_666,2013-06-11T02:11Z,"The first of this series was strange, made no sense whatsoever, and was not very good at all. Number two is not as good as the first, so I wouldn't waste my time. Unless you want to get really baked and watch this for a total mindfuck I wouldn't bother with it. Just mindless gore with a barely functioning story that makes no sense."
,warmonger3,2013-06-13T18:48Z,"While this series reminds me of old 80's horror mags like The Unexpected, in this installment they put in more cheap scares, loads of gore, and less story.
I still really liked two of the stories but really its a watch and toss."
