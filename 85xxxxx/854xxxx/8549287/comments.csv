      In 1973, political correctness took hold of the hiring process for our city. I took the placement tests for the police and fire departments. I scored very well on both, having, for police, the second overall raw score , out or 500+ applicants. I was told not to get my hopes too high,as veteran's points were tallied in (+10%) and the city was hiring one black applicant for each white applicant, regardless of placement on the list. 

     One year later, I joined the fire department. Three months after that, I got a call from the police department asking if I was still interested. I wasn't. You see, I knew many cops who wished they were firefighters, but not many the other way around.

     BTW: By the time I finished my probation and training (40 months), only one of the original ten black policemen hired then were still on the job. Was I bitter? Hell, no! I'd found the best job I could ever hope for, and retired 30 years later."
