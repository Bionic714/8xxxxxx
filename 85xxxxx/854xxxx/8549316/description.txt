A struggling rock musician wants to get his career back on track, so he locks himself and his band in a recording studio overnight to come up with new music. In this process the group ends up sampling an old recording with an ominous voice hidden inside the track. As more frightening events occur, the band try to unravel the truth behind the hidden plea on the record leading to a life or death battle with evil.


EMI Music Publishing helped make this movie. From a music producer's viewpoint, there are MANY technical inaccuracies in this film that make me laugh. Nevertheless, if you understand making music you may enjoy this film.

I recommend using VLC to watch.
