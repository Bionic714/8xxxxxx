,u2att,2013-06-09T17:38Z,Yes  yifi=quality
,tigudik,2013-06-09T19:57Z,"Video: good, 1280x534
Audio: good, In English
English subtitles included as a separate SRT file, but the file shows as blank for me even though I downloaded 100% of it, so I got them from here: http://subscene.com/subtitles/stoker/english/741514"
,zysis,2013-06-10T10:36Z,I often find it amusing when noobs come on and give ratings on YIFY quality.
