A man decides to turn his moribund life around by winning back his ex-girlfriend, reconciling his relationship with his mother, and dealing with an entire community that has returned from the dead to eat the living.

Shaun of the Dead cleverly balances scares and witty satire, making for a bloody good zombie movie with loads of wit.
