,mcmatos,2013-06-07T16:12Z,I'm getting the same server error #8.
,lolocar,2013-06-07T16:27Z,@xZerefx I think I fixed that problem by blocking the game in my firewall.
,SMARTYN89,2013-06-07T17:44Z,"Hi, does this rip have daily prize bonus? or do you need Steam for that?"
,ajthesecond,2013-06-07T17:46Z,"Getting ""Steam Authorization Failed"" whenever I try to open it - confirmed that the crack files are in the install directory."
,KiMp4,2013-06-08T17:51Z,it does inspire matter if you fixed it with the firewall still error
