1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Strategy

Fight off hordes of monstrous mutants created from a strange cataclysmic
event in the new tower defense game, Prime World: Defenders. Join a group
of exile treasure hunters who have ventured into the capital of an ancient
empire, vast with mystery and danger. Prime World: Defenders merges classic
tower defense gameplay with collectible card mechanic. Your towers,
your spells, your traps - all are magic cards, that you can collect and
upgrade. You'll have to develop your own strategy, because you'll get your
random set of cards after each battle. Freeze, burn, poison, explode and
slash countless enemies that will try to stop you from gathering artifacts
of old kingdom. Choose your cards carefully, play them strategically and
expect some heavy resistance along the way - from small and almost harmless
mutated fungi to powerful giant goblins and nagas. Did we mention? In
addition to story-driven single-player campaign Prime World: Defenders
has randomly generated missions
