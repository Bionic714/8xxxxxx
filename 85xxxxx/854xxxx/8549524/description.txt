Game information
=================

Neo-Paris. 2084

Personal memories can now be digitised, bought, sold and traded. The last
remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to
be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the
beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this
surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can
provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a
handful of people

Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the
role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into
people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities,
fearful of her knowledge and capabilities arrested Nilin and wiped her
memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to
recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for
her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this
surveillance society
