""If you think its so easy, why not record a movie yourself and upload it?""

Beacouse no one needs another copy that also sucks. If something ain't easy, sucking at it still sucks. It was the only comment stating facts. If 5 is a good cam, this is 3 tops!"
,ChasUGC,2013-06-13T07:24Z,"@range_os - If the only thing you can do is whine and complain, then why not just wait for the DVD release, or upload a better copy yourself. These uploaders are greatly appreciated for their early releases. 

And, the people who risk jail time and huge fines by recording these movies are also appreciated. Stop spoiling everything with your ungrateful noobish behavior.
