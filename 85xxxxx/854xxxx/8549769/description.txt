After his execution for double-crossing a drug cartel, Rudy Chance - a brutal, corrupt cop and womanizer - expects he'll wind up in Hell. Instead, he finds himself in the Gray Area, where he is forced to combat evil for an afterlife police force in order to gain a shot at redemption. Given extraordinary powers, Chance hunts down the wicked to condemn and the worthy to heal. But can he control his own dark side, or will it lead him to eternal damnation?
