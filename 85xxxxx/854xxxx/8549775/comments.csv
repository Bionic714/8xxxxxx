,naumi,2013-06-07T17:09Z,nice upload ....
,Tegra3,2013-06-07T17:12Z,"dududus I am not really familiar with your uploads, obviously since you don't have a skull next to your name most of us think it's fake and won't DL. I'll DL and will test it once it's finished on Rogero 4.31 Thanks. "
,alm6iri,2013-06-07T18:43Z,33 GB Are You Sure ?
,alm6iri,2013-06-07T18:44Z,Does Not Load
,AFI420,2013-06-07T18:51Z,nfo looks legit
,s1r1,2013-06-07T19:00Z,Thanks and let's hope it's legit.. the 7GB with .rars is fake (password)
,D00dle210,2013-06-07T19:41Z,"This is legit, Duplex released this game last night and is a minimum of 32.76 GB 
the uploader probably has not removed the language files such as ESP FRA ITA and so on... those cause extra space so..."
,bluebug99,2013-06-07T20:02Z,"thank you alot dududus this a great upload

@Tegra3 :not all skulls trusted and i trust dududus's

@alm6iri :yes i am sure i saw it in other sites"
,bluebug99,2013-06-07T20:22Z,"and for the skeptics people you can click the number next to the files tag above you will see duplex ORIGINAL archive inside the folder and the sfv file and nfo file 
Thank you again dududus"
,GopherTee,2013-06-07T21:21Z,"I think Ill just buy this one, if it's any good? Comments?

,bluebug99,2013-06-07T23:13Z,"hi again
sorry for the skull uploaders i meant in my previous comment you don't have to have a skull to be trusted :)
i just want to say that :P"
,bluebug99,2013-06-07T23:17Z,@alm6iri :why you put number 6 in your name insted of the letter ط? xD
,Alex_g_87,2013-06-08T11:24Z,"Hahah love all the calls for FAAAKE, what is wrong with you people, thanks for the up dududus, got it from torrentday however, too slow on here, same release size and .rar though works great, big game so needs to be split and played on internal!"
,blankassf,2013-06-08T11:27Z,"The game ""starts"", but nothing happens after 6 seconds.  The logo ""Last of us"" appears at the bottom right of the screen,  I can acces the menu, but the game will not load. 

I have also tried the Fix, and it's the same problem.   I have tried the ""Eboot original"", and it doesn't work either. 

Does anyone know why?"
,blankassf,2013-06-08T11:28Z,test
,bluebug99,2013-06-08T17:38Z,"yes torrent too slow, so i always download from other source not torrent, but i make torrent the last alternative option, and want it to be berfect :-)"
,alm6iri,2013-06-08T22:24Z,"bluebug99

,makes321,2013-06-10T09:41Z,can someone tell me or direct me to a place how to install and play duplex games?
,mateusmadruga,2013-06-10T21:36Z,I can confirm. This it work like a charm.
,Sphaa80,2013-06-11T16:33Z,"Can someone please telle me why there's a folder called ""BCES01584"" inside the torrent? Do I need to copy that folder to the game folder after unpcking the game?"
,til55on,2013-06-12T17:18Z,"Why is the download speed so extremly low.
I have 5,5Kb/sec at the most.
At this spedd it will take about 2,5 month to download the game."
,xonesxd09,2013-06-12T18:01Z,"oh god, 40 kb/s D: seeeeed!"
,StarDuke,2013-06-12T20:25Z,SEED PLS !!!!
,shaunold,2013-06-12T21:03Z,i can confirm the exact same thing that blankassf wrote. my upload speed isn't very fast but i'm not leaving my utorrent up and slowing down my computer to seed a game that doesn't work. call me selfish or an asshole but why would you want to download a game that doesn't work anyways.
,shaunold,2013-06-12T21:09Z,"and for anybody who says i can't play it because i don't know what i'm doing, i have over 300 games on 2 external hdds; i know a busted game when i see one. tried this on internal as well and it still doesn't work."
,ketterz,2013-06-12T23:37Z,"@shaunold - It most certainly does work. You just have to be patient, as this game has some of the most atrocious initial load times known to man. It takes nearly 3-5 minutes to get to the main menu, and then it takes an additional 4-7 minutes to get into the game after selecting ""New Game"" or ""Continue."" In case you're wondering, I'm running Rogero 4.3 and the latest multiMan.

@Sphaa80 - The ""BCES01584-[The Last of Us]"" file is the folder you will need to move to the ""GAMES"" directory of your PS3's HDD. If you currently have other games backed-up there, they should have similar ""BCES,"" ""BLUS,"" or other prefixes."
,Alexnader78,2013-06-13T00:21Z,"Actually does work, no issues. Just unrar into a brand new folder, FTP everything as is and play."
,majuaraan,2013-06-13T00:22Z,"@shaunold I can confirm, you don't know what you're doing"
,shaunold,2013-06-13T06:55Z,"i read some threads that say to split a big file (and yes i've split big files for games before) but multiman and ps3 splitter both say it doesn't contain a big file and i've got the loading screen without splitting from both internal and external.i know in the past, games wouldn't even load from multiman if it contained a big file. can anybody explain how to get this game to work by just loading it from multiman?"
,floogalloomigahn,2013-06-13T07:32Z,slowest torrent ever. ran 30-40kbps mostly with bursts to 200. DROPPED TO 4 kbps WITH 5% REMAINING! BULLSHIT.
,kitches1991,2013-06-13T09:33Z,"Alexnader78 is right. I had to FTP this huge fuckin game straight to my PS3's internal hard drive from my computer. It took forever but it's finally done and working. The file is just too big for an external hard drive. 

Also, you guys can delete the language files to help save some space when you finally get this game downloaded. Open up the following folders: BCES01584-[The Last of Us] > PS3_GAME > USRDIR > build > main > sound1 > streams > and then delete whatever languages you don't need. Deleting everything but the English language shaves off 7GB of space."
,dududus,2013-06-13T16:38Z,"Fellas:

this torrent is slow because of so many hit and runs.. every hit and run means someone else has to upload 66GB to keep a 1:1 overall ratio. so seed please seed!!

secondly do a google search for SPLIT4G to transfer this to external HDD. then use multiman to copy to internal .. its a lot quicker than FTP.

thirdly the DUPLEX DLC unlocker is sorta bullshit at the moment.. coz it needs activation. i will upload proper DLC when it's released.

bluebug99 hope you like this game dude!

can i please ask everyone to seed this game as much as you can, it could be one of the best PS3 games ever made so lets all sacrifice bandwidth and SEED till the cows come home!

and remember: use SPLIT4G to transfer

enjoy this awesome game!!

,derceto,2013-06-13T19:57Z,Was curious why there is a movie file in it's own folder outside of the packed files.  Is the one in the packed files corrupt?  Should we replace it with the one in the folder?  Thanks.
,dududus,2013-06-13T20:36Z,"hi, no it's not corrupt, i just forgot to delete it 8|"
,smerfff,2013-06-13T21:25Z,"Hi, Can anyone tell me why this is so big? I usually play xbox and the files are about 7-8gb but 33.2GB!!! Seems insanely big. Any insite please"
,Ozzen,2013-06-14T00:24Z,"final fantasy 13 takes up 43gb in HD space.. so, why be surprised if this is 33gb? ever wonder about the obvious reason why this file is so big?"
,smerfff,2013-06-14T06:44Z,Ok Ozzen wise guy whats the obvious reason? All I was asking is hy its so big as Xbox 360 games are 8gb. . . .
,smerfff,2013-06-14T06:52Z,I know that ps3 are blue ray I just did not know that it was that much bigger

,shaunold,2013-06-14T17:36Z,i apologize to the uploader and anyone who read my comments and took them for fact. this game does absolutely work and i retract my previous statements. sorry and thanx for the upload.
,majuaraan,2013-06-14T18:38Z,Some one needs to upload the 25GB rip version here

,Briggled,2013-06-14T22:55Z,"I've no experience with transferring files to the PS3 to play a game. And I have no ethernet cable or flash drive large enough to hold 33GB.

Could someone please make a step-by-step guide on how to get this game to the PS3?"
,VisciusK,2013-06-15T01:47Z,"USA version ...LOL 

Briggled go to youtube and search for FTP transfer to PS3, you can find the more easy way to learn transfer games "
,sextits,2013-06-15T08:20Z,fucking whores all of u
,svartpest,2013-06-15T15:50Z,"Working great on Rogero 4.40 v1.03 and multiMAN 4.40. Copied to external using Split4G. mM copied the split files to internal automatically. I had to delete the prepatched eboot.bin and use the original one (just delete eboot.bin and rename eboot_orig.bin to eboot.bin). Don't set any options in mM. Setting as Internal and turning on BD-Miirror caused black loading screen to hang when starting the game

Plays flawlessly and load times are short (~30 secs on first boot). Fantastic game! Thanks dududus!"
,RoxXxor98,2013-06-15T17:18Z,Someone know Does the game works on 3.55? 
,knourole,2013-06-15T18:55Z,thank you very much works great
,knourole,2013-06-15T18:58Z,"no , you need to download the 3.55 ebootfix by duplex"
