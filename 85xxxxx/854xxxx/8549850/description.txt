Originally issued in the U.K. on the Topic label and later licensed for U.S. release by Rhino, this is one of Gregson & Collister's more uneven projects, but is praiseworthy overall. The influence of Richard Thompson is felt throughout, especially in the often vinegary tone of Gregson's Stratocaster, but Gregson's writing is mature, self-assured, and original enough to keep that influence from becoming overwhelming. The bluesy "I Wouldn't Treat a Dog" bumps up nicely against the shimmery and hook-laden folk-pop of "Everybody Cheats on You," while Thompson is probably owed royalties for "That Same Mistake." That's the beginning of the album, and then things get a bit spottier. The slide guitar on "This Tender Trap" lends an air of Delta blues to a song whose chord progression is half Tin Pan Alley and half Brill Building, and the result is more puzzling than involving; "I Specialize" combines an awkward lyrical refrain with an awkward chord progression, to predictable effect. But brilliant moments outnumber disappointing ones by about two to one, making this album a solid investment for any fan of British folk-rock.
