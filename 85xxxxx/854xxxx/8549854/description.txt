July already? Well its only the first list. While collecting playlists may become available (about 30 tracks) and why wait a few weeks until all lists are ready?

List starting with an ^ are temporary and will be replaced (maybe after some minor corrections) by a definite one starting with an _ and an I-number. So that's why.....

Enjoy,
