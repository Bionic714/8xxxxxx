If you want to make our world a better place to live, then, please, pay your attention to book "Summerhill - A Radical Approach To Child Rearing" written by Alexander Sutherland Neill (or - A. S. Neill). This book may inspire you and change your worldview same as with Jacque Fresco. This book was written near ~1960th, and it is already translated at least to dozen of languages.
