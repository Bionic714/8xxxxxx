,smokkedog2,2013-06-08T01:54Z,"Wow HeroMaster, you went from a hero to zero on this one dude.
The video file looks like it is corrupt. You are neither a hero nor a mater of anything.
I know it is a bit harsh but, it was just irresistible :)"

,burrell82,2013-06-15T15:02Z,I know some of you are having issues with the audio... Here's a tip: Converting the file to .mp4 should do the trick.
