,super1313,2013-06-08T02:04Z,for blus or bles version?
,blankassf,2013-06-08T11:28Z,"The game ""starts"", but nothing happens after 6 seconds.  The logo ""Last of us"" appears at the bottom right of the screen,  I can acces the menu, but the game will not load. 

I have also tried the Fix, and it's the same problem.   I have tried the ""Eboot original"", and it doesn't work either. 

Does anyone know why?

,dududus,2013-06-13T16:40Z,"this is bles just open .sfo file to see region (for future reference)

game works fine, LONG initial loading times then virtually no loading times.

use split4g to put on external, use multiman to copy to internal, no special settings necessary"
,dududus,2013-06-13T19:09Z,i meant open .sfo file with notepad on pc to see version/region etc
