Seattle duo ΓÇ£My Favorite Girl,ΓÇ¥ featuring Trish Shallest and Jennifer Czeisler are the newest alt-country / indie pop group to emerge from the dew-covered Emerald City. Shallest and Czeisler sing together like angels, weaving beautiful harmonies and haunting counter-melodies with colorful hooks into their musical storytelling. Their debut album ΓÇ£Another Bite at the AppleΓÇ¥ (to be released on August 18, 2009 via Golden City Records) showcases 10 earthy, melodic tales of life and love. All of the songs on this release began with Trish and Jen writing together on an acoustic guitar. But when the pair went to Studio Litho these tunes grew from their solid acoustic foundation into polished gems. Featuring shimmery electric hooks swirling around sparkling piano melodies and peppered with rocking rhythmic beats and percussion, the resulting record shines with its unique style and powerful storytelling.
