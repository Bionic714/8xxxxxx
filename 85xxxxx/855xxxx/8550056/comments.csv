V 8/10 - definately not just a CAM rip. A bit blurry fullscreen on a desktop monitor but looks just fine. This is a comedy not action

s 8/10 - can hear audio just fine, few crackles but it's no problems"

,adinko,2013-06-08T23:20Z,"After the credits (the part missing):
The morning after Alan’s wedding, we see Phil waking up groggily in an absolutely trashed bedroom with Alan and Cassie. As he tries to figure out what happened, we see Stu stagger into the room giggling. He’s dressed in women’s panties and has large breasts. As they all wonder what happened, Alan finally remembers that the wedding cake was a gift from Mr. Chow, who obviously drugged it. Mr. Chow enters the room completely naked and proudly proclaims that “It was a sick night, bitches!” Then the monkey from the previous movie drops down on Stu."

I mean, aren't we dudes basically retarted? or isn't that this movie? point being, lets have imdb link to Samsung commercial, same thing."

Subs are Chinese hardcoded. Audio is crackly, but far better than a cam. A watermark is blurred throughout the movie, but I only started noticing it halfway through. The movie is a bit blurry fullscreen, but it works. The download wasn't very fast, so please seed. Thanks to the uploader!

,Phatfish,2013-06-10T18:59Z,"Yes, Chinese people are fucking retarded but Americans are even dumber and Germans and the British aren't any smarter either. Japanese people however are EXACTLY as stupid as the rest. The same can be said for Scandinavians, the french, Australians. If I forgot anyone it's be course I'm retarded. Being human means you are dumb as shit and the fact that you dont even know it makes you even less intelligent.

The movie is what you would expect from this franchise. Its a good waste of time. I really had no problems with the audio except at the beginning. The subs are Chinese hardcoded however I barely noticed once the movie got going. For such a early release, I'd take this V quality with subs over a cam without subs "
,arishi,2013-06-12T14:51Z,quality is good and would you please upload the movie- the kings of summer.
