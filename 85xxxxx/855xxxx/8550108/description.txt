Legendary NYC Steakhouse

Anne brings in four candidates to compete for the next executive chef position at Old Homestead, the oldest steakhouse in New York. The owners are looking for a chef who can help them evolve with the changing neighborhood while keeping what has made Old Homestead successful for generations. The four candidates are tested on their creative butchering when they're asked to create a custom cut of meat. Then the remaining three come up with new and profitable side dishes for Old Homestead's menu. When the final two chefs are each handed the keys to this legendary restaurant for one dinner service, one chef takes a risk and gives Old Homestead a dramatic twist, while the other maintains a firm grasp on the traditional model of what a steakhouse is expected to be. The Sherry Brothers struggle to decide which candidate is the right fit to lead this legendary establishment.
