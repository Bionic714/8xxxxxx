This is the v1.21 patch for the Paradox (retail box) version of Combat Mission: Shock Force (IE, the one they expect you to pay $1 for and then will only let you download for the month that you paid for it).  Use this patch ONLY if you have the Paradox version of the game, if you ordered CMSF from Battlefront.com directly, then this is not for you!
