Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Digging in the Ashes is a limited edition digital comic book that was released with the US CollectorΓÇÖs Edition of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction. The book serves to highlight some of the events that occurred between Conviction and the previous game, Splinter Cell: Double Agent. It is the second Splinter Cell comic book; the first was Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. Digging in the Ashes is the first Splinter Cell comic to star Sam Fisher. It was intended as a digital PDF on a USB drive given with the US Collector's Edition of Conviction, but due to problems with the drives the files were offered free of charge on Ubisoft's website. The comic was written by Eddie Deighton and Jon Sloan, with art by Mike Dowling.
