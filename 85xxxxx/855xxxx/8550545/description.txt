Description:

Screenwriter Eric Red (The Hitcher, Near Dark) offers up a zombie story set in space. On a manned NASA space ship millions of miles from Earth, a terrifying malfunction occurs in the cryogenic hypersleep pods containing the hibernating astronauts, turning most of the crew into the violently brain-dead.
