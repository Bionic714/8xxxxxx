Help me man ! I'm uploading this amazing band . and I have to share this, some of their albuns are very rare , but I have just 2mb , I'm still uploading this , my speed is around 10 - 40 kbps.
 I must upload this to share with people who cant buy because they doesnt have money even to buy it by Itunes  "
,CH3NO2Lab,2013-06-10T22:53Z,I'm doing my part to seed. A lot of the time I've been seeing DL speeds of less than .2 kB/s.
,WasAtWoodstock,2013-06-12T11:48Z,"I don't mind the slow seeding. Not everybody has a fast connection. And the seeder has been continuously seeding.

But what I just noticed is some of the albums in this torrent are NOT lossless. This was uploaded under the FLAC subgroup. All of the non-lossless albums in this torrent will be promptly deleted."
,sauluus77,2013-06-13T09:08Z,"Geez ! I forgot to mention that , the first  2 albuns  are very rare and just found in MP4  , I'll redo the upload and rename . Sorry guys this was  my first upload! 
 I'm not give up to upload this incredible band !"
