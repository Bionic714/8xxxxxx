Madeline and the Black Velvet band recorded Black Velvet in between national and international tour dates. Inspired by Neil YoungΓÇÖs producer David BriggsΓÇÖ work, Madeline followed the strategy of On The Beach and TonightΓÇÖs the Night ΓÇô recording whenever and wherever they could find a couple of microphones, and focusing on capturing the energy of a live show. Black Velvet sounds like an Arthur Russel record one minute, all bedroom pop and private crooning, while turning around and twisting into dark Jefferson Airplane-esque psychedelia the next. MadelineΓÇÖs signature Karen Carpenter/Neko Case meets The Carter Family southern ballads still make an appearance with lyrics about everything from Johnny CashΓÇÖs career as heavenΓÇÖs angel barber to the joy of talking cops out of DUIs. Black Velvet is one of those albums you can see while you hear; a mental music video for every song. Madeline has finally and fearlessly let her mind, mouth and heart open far enough for everyone to get a good look and the results are nothing short of thrilling
