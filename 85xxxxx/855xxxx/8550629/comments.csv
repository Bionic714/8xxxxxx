Your comment makes sense in a way, but dismisses the fact that for the most part of the 20th and 21st century the term UFO has mostly been associated with extraterrestrials. Obviously that a UFO isn't necessarily alien. That being said, if you see a UFO who's to say it is not alien? But yeah, when taking it literally ""UFOs are real"" is as stupid as saying ""The solar system is real"". As a side note, the original title for this documentary, when it was launched, was ""Flying Saucers Are Real"". Must have been a marketing decision to re-brand the title like this."
