Restaurant Impossible - Season 5, Special Episode



Holiday: Impossible

'Tis the season of giving and for Chef Robert's biggest mission to date. He's travelling to Joplin, Mo., a town devastated by one of the country's deadliest tornadoes. After the tornado hit, the local Boys and Girls Club turned into a safe house for kids of all ages, and while it's attendance doubled, it's funding did not. Robert's challenge is two-fold; to transform the Boys and Girls Club into a space both kids and parents will love, and to create a thank-you dinner for 1,000 volunteers in just five hours! With a $30,000 budget, 3 day deadline, and the help of chef Michael Chiarello and some of Robert's old Dinner: Impossible crew, it will be all hands on deck for Joplin.
