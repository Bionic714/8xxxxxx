At the Mimosa boarding house, the ravishing and overbearing Principal (Brigitte Lahaie) teaches attentive, studious schoolgirls the art of all types of sexual pleasures. Hands-on training is intensive. One of Frederic Lansac's greatest successes. Brigitte Lahaie's last x-rated film was warmly received by a crowd of moviegoers at the debut in Paris on October 29, 1980 under the title Les Petites Ecolieres in Alpha-France cinemas.
