The goal was to make the movies feel better with cutting as little as possible. Awkward dialogs and weak moments have been
removed and some scenes have been rearranged. 
The trilogy was edited in reverse. This project started 2 years ago with Episode III and Episode I was the last movie to be 
re-edited.

If you already have Episode III from before, you don't need to get it again. You only need to get Episode I and II. Episode I has not been released before and this Episode II 720p is the newer version never released in 720p resolution before.

If you would like to seed and are already seeding the individual releases, please seed this pack instead and kill the individual releases, you can move Episode III into this and no need to redownload it.
