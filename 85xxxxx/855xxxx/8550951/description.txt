This is nVidia overclock edition vbios made by some PC nerd called svl7 which is something messed around and created by him, he actually takes no responsibilities in case of damage or any guaranty or any kind of support of course but he still asks money to allow people to download, really?
As we all know all big corporations pay for taxes for their engineers and other stuff but they still got pirated, so who are you Mr slv7 to ask money for some illegal job you have done?


This torrent includes unlocked and modified video card bios for different brand laptops with kepler nVidia GPU's and the desktop GTX 780.. This modified bios's gives users larger room for overclock with no problem and some of them are even overvolted to take even more ability for overclock..
It also includes nvflash folder which you will need and a How To text file.

Note: Create a backup of your original vbios just in case of fail..

Caution: You do this at your own risk! No one is responsible in case of any damage of your system except you, So be careful..

Any questions are welcomed.
