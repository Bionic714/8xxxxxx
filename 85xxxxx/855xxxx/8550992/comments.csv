You are welcome."
[V],bestec1234,2013-06-09T15:34Z,"I love it when people comment about the attractiveness of the models, as if you are personally responsible for the beauty of the models you post.   Like they're your daughters or something.

I personally like ""90s chicks"".  I fell in love with quite a few of them them in college. :D"
[V],thegreenfrog,2013-06-09T22:25Z,"I love it even more when that person has uploaded exactly nothing on TPB.

The beauty of it all is that he still has a choice and there is always the possibility of asking for a specific model..."
,craigrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr,2013-06-09T23:02Z,"Huh? Sorry... I was just noticing that the several last number of uploaded ATK sets were all of women who had the same look. Guess I was being unappreciative. But thank you, thank you, thank you, bestec and greenfrog, for all the good uploads."
