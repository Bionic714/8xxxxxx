Watched it last night, and have been searching on Google for the 2nd (I couldn't get the search bar on TPB to find it), and finally found your upload less then a minute after it went online."

,DOCSAP,2013-06-08T08:56Z,"audio track 1 is English stereo 2.0, track 2 is English 5.1.
A:9, V: 9, proper copy, and a sequel much better than the first ""VHS""."
