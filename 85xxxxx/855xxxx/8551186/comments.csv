Don't forget to seed this after downloading so others can enjoy.
Good Luck!"

,MrRickardo,2013-06-11T02:36Z,Today I uninstalled Tekla Structures  and deleted all the  files from my drive. I then downloaded the file and installed the program per directions and it worked fine. I hope you resolve your protocol issues my friend. Good Luck. Stay Thirsty.
