Thanks Drarbg many people are sure to copy your upload"
,redhawk911,2013-06-08T17:09Z,"is the audio quite echoey, i had another version ending ""fanta"" video was ok, but the audio whilst very audible resembled what happens if you set your soundcard to concert hall ...  slightly echoey"
,crumrugin,2013-06-08T19:24Z,"no read above on my second comment this has no echo it is a line feed with a little background garble. just a little noise in the line , and that has been effectively squashed by the encoder as shown in a sample provided.. for most  people it is as good as dvd"
