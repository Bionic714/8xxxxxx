,buenio,2013-06-08T04:32Z,VERY WORST MOVIE IT DOESN'T this Movie doesn't deserve 1080p Quality 240p is the perfect quality for this kind of movie. Sorry JUDAS :D
,LowDef,2013-06-08T04:52Z,@buenio this has just as the same properties as his other rips so either you have a dollar store moniter or you were high while watching this
,joser116,2013-06-08T05:37Z,"@lowdeg- He was talking about the movie itself, not the encode -_-"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-08T08:06Z,"some people liked it.... some people hate it.... 

a lot of people think star trek 2009 was a waste of time and bandwidth....... I don't judge..."
,mi.tom,2013-06-08T13:17Z,"yup star trek is utterly waste of time and senseless movie...i dont know how it got that much rating at imdb..this is a good movie though,,entertaining.thanx judas."
,teh-amazing,2013-06-08T15:16Z,"Ah, thanks again Judas. Just curious - any word on The Hobbit? I believe there is an extended version? I prefer your downloads so I am stubborn to go elsewhere lol."
,buenio,2013-06-09T06:34Z,@LowDef i think you are high I'M talking about the movie not the quality sigh.
,iamspellborn,2013-06-09T09:40Z,could you upload 2012 or Doomsday next?
,eroticburps,2013-06-09T15:28Z,"hi dhjudasx .... could u buy the blu-ray of 
"" I AM NUMBER FOUR "" ...."
,drakemood,2013-06-09T21:09Z,booo @buenio this movie is fun
,jwinston78,2013-06-10T04:09Z,"nah, this is typical 'booring' hollywood movie these day, same as jack the giant killer.. nice rip as usual.. thanks to dhjudasx.. cheers.. :)"
,buenio,2013-06-10T04:40Z,@dhjudasx what is your DEATH RACE 2008 is it Unrated or theatrical cut?
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-10T18:35Z,"nowhere near my computer right now to check the versions of the movies I have... unfortunately I know some aren't the extended or unrated versions....

i'm still trying to pay off my critical bills in order to put some more funds towards some blurays.... so please be patient."
,iamspellborn,2013-06-11T17:25Z,"no hurry, dude.. upload anything u want, whenever u want...

But i was wondering, since u have financial troubles, why don't u start a blog where u announce what's next, and put links of your uploads, and discuss about other encoders' rips and stuff like that? You've got a large following, so i guess that blog would have a lot of views and you could put advertisments on the blog and make money out of it... Sure it wouldn't be that much, but i guess it would be enough for buying a few blurays each month... think about it..."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-11T18:09Z,"i'm not the type of person to do blogging lol...

Barely have time to do this actually."
