An indispensable guide to thousands of years of spiritual inquiry, The Kabbalistic Tradition features writings from a variety of literary forms -- from the earliest biblical sources through twentieth-century studies -- as well as practical information and practices for the modern reader. These selections concentrate on the three main areas of Kabbalistic creativity -- the literature of Zohar, the Lurianic corpus, and the Chasidic mystical tradition.

Alan Unterman's enlightening introduction examines the unique characteristics of the Kabbalah and places this volume in its proper historical and philosophical context.
