Harold Bloom - Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present (Harvard University Press, 1989).

ISBN: 9780674780286 | 214 pages | PDF


Literary critic Harold Bloom surveys with a majestic view the literature of the West from the Old Testament to Samuel Beckett.

He provocatively rereads the Yahwist (or J) writer, Jeremiah, Job, Jonah, the Iliad, the Aeneid, DanteΓÇÖs Divine Comedy, Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, the Henry IV plays, Paradise Lost, Blake's Milton, Wordsworth's Prelude, and works by Freud, Kafka, and Beckett. In so doing, he uncovers the truth that all our attempts to call any strong work more sacred than another are merely political and social formulations. This is literary criticism at its best.


Reviews

"Bloom's puissance is not entirely his own; for some of it, he is indebted to Nietzsche, Freud, Schopenhauer, Gershom Scholem, and other masters. But enough of it is his own to constitute a distinctive form of splendor." -- Denis Donoghue, The New York Review of Books

"In some ways the wildest of the wild men (and women), in some ways the most traditional of the traditionalists, Harold Bloom remains serene amid the turbulence--much of it caused by him. He stands dauntless, a party of one, as thrilling to behold up on the high wire as he is (at times) throttling to read on the pageΓÇª From this strong critic dealing with these strong poets comes a potent mix of insight." -- Mark Feeney, The Boston Globe

"The wit, the eclecticism and the gripping paradoxes ΓÇª the force of [Bloom's] intellect carries the reader from pinnacle to pinnacle, showing a new spiritual landscape from each." -- Roger Scruton, The Washington Times
