2 of these 3 CD's are from the (10) volume private collection....the other is

"Hot Summer Dance" from 1960 which has been previously uploaded.


I thought the three performances should be available from a single .torrent

since they're so closely related.


Paul Gonsalves has one of the most unique tenor sax voices in all of jazz..

instantly recognizeable.........like Benny Golson.  Gonsalves has a Prez-like

feeling but wanders into different keys...like I said...unique.
