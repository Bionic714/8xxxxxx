Eyes Adrift represents the first teaming of Krist Novoselic, guitarist Curt Kirkwood, and former Sublime drummer Bud Gaugh. While Novoselic's previous project, Sweet 75, was misbegotten, the ex- Nirvana bassist's new "tragedy all-star" band draws on a rich vein of lilting psychedelic country rock that borrows heavily from the mid-period work of another of its members, the Meat Puppets' Kirkwood. Eyes Adrift's Americana resonates thanks to its solidness and maturity. --Everett True
