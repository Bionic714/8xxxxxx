I may suggest playing it a little low on the volume as the rip is quite loud, but clear.

Enjoy!"
,greull,2013-06-08T03:45Z,Also seems to be a slight crackle on a1 but certain that's the nature of that track as it disappears immediately on a2 and the rest of the songs are crystal.
,greull,2013-06-08T04:13Z,"Yep, I definitely ripped this at too loud a volume. It's got quite a bit of crackle now that I listen to it a few times. Sorry folks, guess I'll go through the receiver next time."

The crackle is the nature of the cassette, it's a bit old.
So I won't be re-ripping.
Moving on to Republica vinyl.

Cheers"
