MILES DAVIS

PLAYS CLASSIC BALLADS (dolby cassette)


A great companion to Kind Of Blue, which is, I'm sure why CBS put this compilation together. All of the eight tracks are smooth, mellow studio performances from Miles and his various companions.


I ran my line directly through my higher end JVC cassette deck with Dolby ON, as it is a Dolby cassette. No receiver involved. 16-48 FLACS level 8, fully tagged.
