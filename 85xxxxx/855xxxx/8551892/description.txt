Neural UpMix is a groundbreaking plug-in for the post-production and mixing communities. Combining precision and creative flexibility, it can output 5.1 or 7.1 multi-channel stems from stereo or 5.1 source material and is intended for projects where the original source elements for a conventional upmix are not available. It is especially useful for catalog films, TV series, documentaries, menus, deleted scenes, and featurettes.
Unlike other technologies, audio stems processed with Neural UpMix properly downmix in the consumer environment. This is essential in preserving the intent and quality of the original mix. Neural UpMix is also far from a "set-and-forget" plug-in, providing creative controls for soundfield width and depth, channel layout, output levels, LFE filtering and a final limiter.
