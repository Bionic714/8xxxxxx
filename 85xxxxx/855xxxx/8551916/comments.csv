,papayrus,2013-06-08T10:10Z,No server browser like in MW3 and MW2 fourdeltaone? I don't have any friends.
,zerofreeze5,2013-06-08T13:39Z,"You need to register at the 4D1 site, in order to have friends. 

So register a account and send some friend requests, or go to a topic and ask people to add you.

And then just start t5mp.exe and go to Friends list, and you'll see people (that is if they're in your friend list on the site, they need to accept your request)"
