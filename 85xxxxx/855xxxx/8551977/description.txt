Yes, there actually is a way to let everything become your teacher, to let life itself, and everything that unfolds within it, the ΓÇ£full catastropheΓÇ¥ of the human condition in the words of Zorba the Greek, shape your ongoing development and maturation. Millions have followed this path to greater sanity, balance, and well-being, often in the face of huge stress, pain, uncertainty, sorrow, and illness.

Now, in this companion volume, 100 pointers from that groundbreaking work have been carefully selected to inspire you to embrace what is deepest and best and most beautiful in yourself.
