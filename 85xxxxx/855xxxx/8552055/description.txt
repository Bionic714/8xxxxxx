Hello all! I ONLY upload torrents that are well organised and excellent quality.

Audio files are encoded in MAXIMUM QUALTIY VBR, LAME mp3 from FLAC files.
All tracks are named correctly and tagged with hi-res album art (500x500) minimum. 

I'm currently working through my FLAC data base, if you have any requests leave them in the comments and I'll check out the availability of the files I need.
Please don't ask for Lady Gaga or something, many others upload that kind of "music." Check out my uploads for an idea of the kind of jams that go down in this neck of the woods.

Peace!
