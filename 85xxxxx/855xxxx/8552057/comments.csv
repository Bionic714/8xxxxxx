,peryko,2013-06-08T23:58Z,"Thanks for uploading, but I can't get games to work. I downloaded this one an dlc's, put in the same directory and run, when I select a game and classic mode on it, I keep pushing start button but the game doesn't start.
Help please."
,tfox71,2013-06-09T01:21Z,"Disable controller combo for screenshots on freestyle dash 3 as it causes issues with starting any game in Capcom Arcade cabinet.
Go into the plugins section of your settings then f3plugin & untick enable controller combo for screenshots, and disable it."
,shikibane,2013-06-09T01:28Z,@peryko i know what your problem is for any game that does this in this collection just press select go to options settings then game options and turn on credit insertion then exit the pause menu and press select to insert coins.
,shikibane,2013-06-09T01:37Z,@peryko you also should do what tfox71 mentioned. Fsd's in game screenshot setting causes problems for a few games iv'e come across not just capcom arcade cabinet.
,shikibane,2013-06-09T01:57Z,@peryko im sorry i said it was select to insert coins its actually lb and lt at the same time this can be changed in options though under controls.
,peryko,2013-06-09T13:39Z,"Many thanks fellows. It worked.
One more question, I'm having problems with castlestorm, it's keeping loading and can't play it, do you have any idea?
Thanks again."
