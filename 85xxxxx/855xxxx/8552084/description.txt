Jeff Shinabarger, "More or Less: Choosing a Lifestyle of Excessive Generosity"
ISBN: 0781408202 | 2013 | EPUB

In More or Less, Jeff Shinabarger calls readers to create their own social experiments to answer the question, ΓÇ£What is enough?ΓÇ¥

It all started with one idea: What would happen if we created a culture in which we gave away whatever was more than enough for us? How would our habits change if we shed the excess of money, clutter, and food in our lives? In More or Less, readers will learn how to draw a line of ΓÇ£enoughΓÇ¥ in their consumer choices, how to see generosity as a chance to experience freedom in a greedy world, and how to make small changes now that will help others forever. As Shinabarger reminds them, defining ΓÇ£enoughΓÇ¥ is more than a responsibilityΓÇöit is an opportunity to give hope. With a foreword by Bob Goff.
