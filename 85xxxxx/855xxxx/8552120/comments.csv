,zakimar5,2013-06-08T17:00Z,"Maybe if the movie poster wasn't so gay, this travesty of a movie would have made some money."
,K_Ranger,2013-06-08T20:35Z,@zakimar5  - Add to your statement -->  Maybe if it didn't have washed-up no-talent fucked-in-the-head Jim Carrey in it...... THEN it makes total sense.  
,ironymon,2013-06-09T10:09Z,"Exactly why i avoided the movie, cause the poster was so gay, the guy in the middle gives off gay vibe. I'll give it a try, while holding delete button."
,SgtGoldy,2013-06-09T12:00Z,From the IMDB trailer it looks pretty fun as a family movie. But then again I have a feeling they put all the best parts in the trailer... 
,xolido,2013-06-09T13:08Z,Tyy!
,CostlyC,2013-06-09T21:50Z,"I gave this movie a solid 9. I defy any stoner to roll up, watch, and not enough. It's a good strong comedy by Steve Carell and by the former superstar of comedy Jim Carey. 
A - 10

Give it shot it made it to the Top download section afterall.   "
