Just as one is encouraged to ΓÇ£shop early for ChristmasΓÇ¥, Pigman suggests that one should seed early for Christmas as well. I found these ΓÇ£at the back of a drawerΓÇ¥ on my hard disk so thought I would share them now ΓÇô but donΓÇÖt open your download until Christmas, otherwise Santa may not come callingΓÇªΓÇª.

These are four stories, each read by Tom Conti, and with a Christmas theme:

1) The Blue Carbuncle ΓÇô Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
A well known Sherlock Holmes tale of a stolen diamond discovered inside a Christmas goose.

2) The Thieves Who CouldnΓÇÖt Help Sneezing ΓÇô Thomas Hardy		
Not the sort of thing one thinks of from Thomas Hardy, this is the story of horse thieves and house breakers in Wessex.

3) The Necklace Of Pearls ΓÇô Dorothy L Sayers
Not my favourite author or favourite detective, Lord Peter Wimsey finds himself as usual in a country house

4) The Flying Stars ΓÇô G K Chesterton
Father Brown finds himself involved with Pantomime people. (Oh no he doesnΓÇÖt!)
