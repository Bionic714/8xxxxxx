TOP HOOKER is an in-your-face, full-throttle competition series that splits 10 expert fishers into two teams and pits them head to head in a series of insane, never-before-seen fishing challenges. Traveling across the country to some of the most remote, popular, yet jarringly different fishing holes, competitors struggle through eight hard weeks on the road and 24 off-the-hook challenges - all culminating in just one chance to be crowned the "TOP HOOKER". Animal Planet throws down the gauntlet with exhilarating dares, enticing fishers to free dive for the perfect pearl and net Asian carp that fly through air. In a nautical game of catch and release, who catches the chance to proceed to the next round and who's off the hook?
