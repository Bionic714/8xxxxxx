Why the obscure video format for real player? Converted to AVI and vlc playes movie just fine.

thanx for the effort."

the ripper or orig uploader is here

so ask him.

if you want a xvid with no subs then only copy is the one I done in my UFO bundle.. but the quality is not the best

as I said before there is a true dvd rip in mkv floating about but alas no one shared on TPB and only direct links so it got removed quickly"
