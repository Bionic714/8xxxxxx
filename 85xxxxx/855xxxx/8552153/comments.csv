,WasAtWoodstock,2013-06-11T02:13Z,"I don't understand the TQMP project. The file was not split into tracks. Some TQMPs are split into tracks, but those always lack meta tags and embedded art. It isn't a quality rip unless the ripper completes the job.

EAC is no better than other ripping software. And people that use EAC are often too lazy to complete the job and split into tracks.

Now I do understand that the single file can be used to create an identical CD that will get the track data from online databases. But who cares about this these days. If you have an old car that only plays CDs, there isn't an online database for it to read.

And... The info on the album posted above wasn't included as a text file inside the torrent."
