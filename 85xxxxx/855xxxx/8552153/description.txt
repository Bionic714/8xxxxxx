Review-
Esoteric has done it again with yet another fantastic reissue. 24-bit digital remastering of original recordings sound great! we are greatly treated to 2 discs, rather than just one. and the second disc is just as good as the original recordings! there are four previously unissued versions of signed curtain, part of the dance, and some tracks not on the original, memories membrane, and horse. then, there are two bbc radio one sessions of the john peel show of 1/72 and 4/72. immediate kitten and marchides is about 29' of live material that sounds great! oh, on the first disc, there is as extras: o caroline/signed curtain as single edits, and previously unreleased part of the jam at 20'! besides all this high quality bonus materials, there is an informative booklet to read also. no need to ask if it's worth replacing your old single disc set, because i'm tellin' ya, yeah! replace them with these new esoteric releases. you'll be glad you did.
