Priceless!!

Thx as always for da up anonymous"
,cube10025,2013-06-08T08:19Z,So where is the episode? 
,abacus23,2013-06-08T09:23Z,"Another POINTLESS Overtime upload.  Overtime sucks.  You can watch it on the HBO website or YouTube.

Thanks as always, for this redundant garbage upload"
,xenoFLASH,2013-06-08T09:37Z,"@abacus23: This is not you, then. Why comment?
Your parents should be beaten and raped for not teaching you manners.                                                                                                                                                 
Thanks for the upload, for those of us who would rather dl and not stream."
,in_hollywood,2013-06-08T09:45Z,"Yeah pointless to put this one up, you could be encoding the full episode instead. 

TV Team and Evolve usually have it up fast but so far not tonight. "
,sean_nin,2013-06-08T09:54Z,"Overtime is quite pointless, why not just make the actual show 10 minutes longer? VICE can wait."
,abacus23,2013-06-08T10:19Z,"@xenoFLASH  Typical n00b!!

You are aware you can download any youtube video, right?  And pretty much any streaming video on the net.  Well, I guess you are not aware.  Because you have proved your slight intelligence.

Overtime is uploaded on YouTube and hbo.  It is much quicker to download the video off of youtube! Every browser has plug-ins to download videos off of youtube and other websites... Again, making this a POINTLESS torrent!!

Silly dumb n00b's.  Who think they are giving out a computer lesson.  LOL. "
[T],theburningbush,2013-06-08T13:09Z,"To abacus23 and other wastes of carbon:
1. If you took the time to DL this, you would see that this version is different from the HBO online version, in that this version includes the *extra* New Rules segment.
2. Even if this version *didn't* include the extra New Rules, how is the posting of this version harming you or your interests, you insignificant speck?
2. Here's a word you should add to your vocabulary: CONVENIENCE.

To Anonymous:
1. The size of the swarm speaks for itself: people appreciate your UL. Ignore infants like abacus23.
2. Thank you!!"
,xenoFLASH,2013-06-08T13:15Z,Torrent everything!
,canoli99,2013-06-08T14:21Z,"i'll never understand people who comment just to cry like little bitches that ""THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANT"" wah wah wah. God damn people get a life. 

meanwhile THANK YOU to the uploader and seeders! Much appreciated!"
,moonerman100,2013-06-08T14:57Z,"Thank you man, appriciate it alot :)"
,North33A,2013-06-08T15:47Z,"Thanks for uploading, I always love catching an extra 10 minutes of Bill and Co. after Real Time. 
And, yeah, we could go watch on HBO.com, sure, but has anyone else noticed they seem to go down EVERY FRIDAY around the same time? Torrenting Overtime instead is just easier for some people, so thanks for making it available for us.

And hey, stop bitching, other commenters. Be glad with your free TV shows, as they are free."
