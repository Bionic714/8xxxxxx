Beachbody's Turbo Jam x264 MP4 DVDrip

Turbo Jam is the workout that doesn't feel like work. Chalene Johnson packs each workout with calorie- blasting cardio, kickboxing, body-sculpting, and dance moves set to the hottest music ever. You're scorching fat and sizzling calories at a rate of up to 1,000 an hour . . . It's fast. It's fun. It works.

A recent university study showed that you can burn over 700 calories in just one 45-minute Turbo Jam workout and up to 1,000 calories an hour. That's nearly twice as effective as walking, jogging, yoga, Pilates, and even circuit training. By adding Chalene's Turbo Sculpting Gloves, you'll supercharge your workout and activate 96% more muscle activity than with Turbo Jam alone.

The secret is Turbo Training, which works your upper body, lower body, and abs all at the same time. And Chalene's easy-to-follow "Elite 11" signature moves target your abs and core and are guaranteed to give you a sleek, sexy body.

Inspired by dance and martial arts moves, each "Elite 11" move targets a specific muscle group or body part to strengthen and sculpt your physique and promote overall balance and core strength. The moves are fun and effective, and they really work!
