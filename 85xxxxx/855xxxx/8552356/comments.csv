See the ""LEGENDARY.EDITION"" part,could be nice if someone stated in the info what it actually contains."
,paperboy666,2013-06-08T12:32Z,Which languages are included in this release?
,revanhan,2013-06-08T12:40Z,"@Liman_Bot
1st, do not spam post.
2nd, be polite to the uploader. for u didn't pay a single cent to him yet u r enjoying his hardwork. 
3rd,use some common sense and google it. u r mature enough not to be spoonfed everything. if u do follows up a bit on latest gaming news, then u shuld know the last and complete and final version of skyrim containing everything was released by bethesda studio on 7th of June worldwide. after this there will be no more dlcs or updates for skyrim for the skyrim development team will move on to other projects such as elder scrolls online."

Second i didn't ask for pictures i asked for a simple copy paste~2 secs
Third don't act like you know shit"
,topk,2013-06-08T14:08Z,Is this one the legit Legendary Edition rip or yet another self-assembled compilation of all DLCs and calling it Legendary Edition?
,vinceagashi,2013-06-08T14:14Z,"Also, if anyone can confirm the difficulty to get this one working? I know a lot about computers but torrenting is something I am very new to. I get very happy when things just work after extracting them. Anything beyond that something usually goes wrong. I'll install it and then it will tell me I need a disk. I'll mount it and some file will be missing. Or the game just won't play when I click play or whatever. Or it crashes on start up. "
,brianxxx,2013-06-08T16:50Z,"@ revanhan - 
Very well said. Hard for the children to understand the adults though most of the time."
,ithinkimoutofarrows,2013-06-08T18:29Z,"@topk

The difference between a manual compilation of all the DLCs and the latest patch and the ""Legendary Edition"" is just that one is called Legendary Edition and the other one isn't. And since we're receiving a pirated and ripped version of something that further makes the point moot.

,InternetBatman,2013-06-10T08:43Z,This has no legendary difficulty fake....
,Timbo6669,2013-06-10T12:46Z,lol...^^^^
,sherrypizza,2013-06-10T18:15Z,"Ive just completed download and installed it, Its a legendary edition, I can confirm that but the legendary option in difficulty menu"
,ftamas89,2013-06-10T19:01Z,Thanks for the torrent! Works well! There is Legendary difficult. There are no bugs in graphic. Version: 1.9.32.0. I can use use AntiFREEZE mod with this downloaded game. I downloaded it in 13 hours and now I seed it. Thanks again!
,abstractworld,2013-06-10T19:34Z,What are some must-have mods that I should get with this? I've never played skyrim before and I want to get the best mods like HD textures etc.
,everx7,2013-06-10T23:37Z,"I can only confirm, what ive tried, so far, maxed out the settings, looked at data files, there are high res textures and all the dlcs also my old saves worked perfectly, since i first played skyrim, changed graphics card, now i can run the game absolutely smoothly, before that i couldnt and the last thing, what for me confirms, even if its not the proper release that its like or is the LE,  it has legendary difficulty, so if u were i dont know guessing what this is or hesitant that this will not be what u want, rest assured that u dont need skidrow or any other scene group or p2p group to make u a nice exact legit unchallenged Legendary edition, feel free to download and seed, honestly i didnt really cared about if its the real or no real deal, i just wanted to have everything in one place, meaning the DLCs and the HiREs Texture pack, and now i got it, so either way, its not fake"
,everx7,2013-06-11T01:37Z,"ok i take what i said back, or at least for now, was playing my savegame, dont know if its that or something else, the save before this rls, and im playing, everything fine, and suddenly im just thrown out into windows, so i dont know if its the release thats somehow wrong, or is it that my savegames are from a different version of the game, or its simply just that i must begin a new character and a new game, will try out, let u know or u can if u did"
,everx7,2013-06-11T02:31Z,"seems that the problem was the high res textures, not only it crashed after playing like a minute or so, at least for me, but also when i switched to see the skill trees, instead of nice night sky filled with stars, i had wonderful pink something instead, so, i think ill play without HRT for now, didnt noticed that much difference in graphics anyway and besides something that f*cks up the graphics and the game keeps crashing almost every same time, better be without it, then playing a mess"
,diras2010,2013-06-11T02:49Z,"i don't wanna crash your party guys, but this IS NOT the OFFICIAL Legendary Ed.

This is a bulk of the official releases and wrapped with the last update, i had all the stuff of Skyrim like this, but i prefer a 'OEM' wrap, because the installation goes seamlessly and 'should' be less prone to odd crashes, like you guys have been experimenting

and for the size of the file, i think it is only english languaje"

,iWrath,2013-06-11T09:37Z,"""System information is unable to open this .nfo file. the file might be corrupt or incompatible with this version of system information""   Thats what i get when i run the ""skle-walmart""  Someone help! :/

,iWrath,2013-06-11T11:26Z,"New problem :/ Launcher not working. when i run the launcher it brings up my steam, i've tried removing steam but then it doesn't respond at all, i can not play the game via steam due to the fact that i didn't pay for the game..."
,SilentYan,2013-06-11T14:30Z,How do I check if the DL's are working? Because I've been trying to buy a home and I don't have the option in the dialogue (even after doing all the quests and becoming a Thane).
,everx7,2013-06-11T16:55Z,"Wrath - did u crack the game, use the one included in this rls ? or did u not u must copy the files and overwrite the existing ones"
,everx7,2013-06-11T16:59Z,"SilentYan - to buy a house u dont need any of the DLCs, it was in the original as well, btw about buying and equiping ur house u dont speak to the thane about it, u mus speak with his hm helper or minister or servant or i dont know who the fck it is i dont remember anymore :), begin just yesterday anew and am only in Riverside (hope thats what its called) )D"
,diras2010,2013-06-11T17:59Z,"SilentYan: the Hearthfire DLC adds the ability of buy 3 new properties, and build a home from scratch, and adds the ability to adopt 2 children for each home available for buying, so it doesn't affect the fact that you can buy 'preconfigured' houses around Skyrim, in order to buy a house without the DLC, you had to become Thane and then speak with the Housecarl of the Jarl in the hold where you want to buy"

I started the game and my save game was still there. I jump into the game, wait a couple of days, go to a major city, and i am not approached by anyone one to start the dawnguard missions, no zealots to go to solstine(sp?) and no messenger telling me to go to falkreth(sp?) so that i can get my property. Has anyone confirmed that the dlcs are actually working? Should I  be able to use my old character from another download? do i need to start from scratch?"
