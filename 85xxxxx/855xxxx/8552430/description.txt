Description:

Monotonous sounds of the ocean in the musical version, suitable for relaxation, 
 meditation and overall physical and mental relaxation.
Music from the beginning seem tedious, but then prove to be very soothing 
 to the suggestive result.
Note: You can do anything, you do not even catch on too sounds, 
 music can still find its way into your head.
Have a nice experience and a good night's sleep!
