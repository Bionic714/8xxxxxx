,Fluttershy_Pony,2013-06-10T15:26Z,"I guess I can... Season 8 isn't out yet, but I can do season 6 later, I would first like this torrent to gather enough seeders so I don't have to be the only one with a full copy.

I'm not sure what to do now, I can't seed as it keeps giving me a NAT error. It worked fine before, but after turning my computer back on it had this problem. I tried changing the modem settings and other things, but it won't work.

I guess this torrent is gone now as I can't find any way to get my computer to seed it... Sorry for wasting your time."
