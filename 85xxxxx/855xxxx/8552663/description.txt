Um, hello, here's the complete seventh season of SpongeBob SquarePants, ripped directly from the disc. Since it's interlaced, it's best if you turn deinterlacing on with your media playing program (like VLC), so it looks better. I have no clue why the audio is 192 KB/s, it's how they released it.

I don't know how to rip each episode individually, so I'm just releasing the entire 4 discs. If you know how, feel free to re-upload the complete season with each episode ripped (at its highest quality). Each of the 4 files have the original name from when I ripped it.
