Eddie Cantor has a strange cameo appearance in this one.

The two abrupt edits in this episode were unavoidable, because 
I once again took 5 files from the original You Tube uploader
and merged them into one. To make sure nothing was cut off he
overlapped a few seconds at the start of each file.  
But then you aren't saving these for your
collection any more than I am. Watch it and then delete it. Right ?
