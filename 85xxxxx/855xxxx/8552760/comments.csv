,Umirivach,2013-06-11T15:10Z," After LVL 9 game crashes. 

Error - texture2.fbq is corrupted. Reinstall the game. 

Tried reinstalling, didn't help. Downloaded and tried Stiflers torrent. The same. Guessing that skidrow messed up. "
,rcords,2013-06-11T18:46Z,"Same texture2.fbq error.

Maybe the file from one of the other Trine 2 versions would work."
,rcords,2013-06-12T07:48Z,"Well my hunch was right.

If you take texture2.fbq from this torrent:
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7607655/Trine_2_%5Bv1.18%5D___Goblin_Menace_DLC_(2012)_PC___THETA

...then it passes the file check and level 10 loads without error. The files are the same size but skidrow messed up somehow."
,rcords,2013-06-12T07:53Z,"Maybe one of VIP's would like to upload the 400 meg file as a fix?

I've completed lvl 10 using this and lvl 11 loads."
,rcords,2013-06-12T08:00Z,"Oh it's just 1 byte, if you have a hex editor:

>fc /b texture2.fbq texture2.fbq.skidrow
Comparing files TEXTURE2.FBQ and TEXTURE2.FBQ.SKIDROW
