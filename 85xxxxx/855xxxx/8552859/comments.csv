,jackel792,2013-06-13T21:29Z,"Just curious, does this contain the supremacy packs?"
,jackel792,2013-06-13T21:30Z,or the domination or madness packs for that matter?
,jackel792,2013-06-13T21:32Z,"Does this contain the madness, supremacy and domination head/skin packs with this?"
,crooks90,2013-06-14T12:14Z,"Me and a friend downloaded this, and got on hamachi. When we tried to connect to each other, a message comes up saying ""you are playing a different patch version"", when we have the same download."
,ColinJay,2013-06-15T00:58Z,"I downloaded it and installed it but, the DLC isn't loading or working. I see that all the DLC is in the DLC folder but in-game I don't have any."
,ColinJay,2013-06-16T00:40Z,"Never mind my last comment, I figured it out.

Also, why can't I connect to the shift thing? I was to put in shift codes but I'm unable to connect ever."
