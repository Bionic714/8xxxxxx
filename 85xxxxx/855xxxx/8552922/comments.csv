Honestly, I'd forgotten. For #s 900 and 1000, I'll pick something less mediocre.  ;-)"

Can't believe it's been 800 already."
,Mothra67,2013-06-08T16:01Z,Congrats!  I am working on something special for my 200th UL coming up here soon
,binderguy1,2013-06-08T16:41Z,"Thanks for the ul!  

Congrats on your 800th torrent!  

You know what you should do for your 1000th torrent?  Ul a complete collection of a publisher such as Image, Dark Horse, Innovation, Comico, etc.

Do something that will make you be remembered for the existence of TPB.  ;-)"
