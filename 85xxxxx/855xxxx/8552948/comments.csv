,ddonindia,2013-06-08T13:10Z,Thanks sir!!!!
,topk,2013-06-08T13:22Z,"You're working even on a Saturday 7am

Is this a legit Legendary or another self-assembled compilation?"
[V],PirateBoy,2013-06-08T14:38Z,"WalMart... well, they may be fraud or fake. But, according to me, they are good to go as long as we keep getting these releases lol."
,jgato88,2013-06-08T14:40Z,"@Gh0stNet

Even if what you say is true, i'm not saying it isn't, is this legit? Is this the legendary edition or just a compilation of the original release with the updates and DLCs all repacked together? Multilanguage?"
,papayrus,2013-06-08T16:07Z,Yeah is this legit or just a compilation someone answer please that has tried it. Also is this supposed to mean that it contains all DLC and updates for skyrim like a total all in one deal because even if it's not legit but has it all sounds good too.
,revanhan,2013-06-09T00:45Z,"@Gh0stNet
Agreed. It seems like this so called Legendary Edition is another self made repack of skyrim into one single iso and is NOT the cracked version of official skyrim legendary edition release. WaLMaRT should have state this out in their nfo instead of misleading people."
,papayrus,2013-06-09T04:16Z,Are you serious this is not the real deal? Anyone else get a change to try it and see if it is legit?
,romi1208,2013-06-09T16:10Z,GUYS! This is the Stifmeister. I think we can all agree this shit must be legit!
,romi1208,2013-06-09T16:12Z,NOPE! Wait. This shit is unofficial but still works apparently. So no probs with me.
,papayrus,2013-06-10T12:02Z,It might be Mr.Stifmeister but that doesn;t change the facts. If it's not really what it says it is then it should be said what it really is. Gets.
,papayrus,2013-06-10T12:11Z,Can we get a legit release of this skidrow or someone who does legit releases from the scene?
,everx7,2013-06-10T23:38Z,"I can only confirm, what ive tried, so far, maxed out the settings, looked at data files, there are high res textures and all the dlcs also my old saves worked perfectly, since i first played skyrim, changed graphics card, now i can run the game absolutely smoothly, before that i couldnt and the last thing, what for me confirms, even if its not the proper release that its like or is the LE, it has legendary difficulty, so if u were i dont know guessing what this is or hesitant that this will not be what u want, rest assured that u dont need skidrow or any other scene group or p2p group to make u a nice exact legit unchallenged Legendary edition, feel free to download and seed, honestly i didnt really cared about if its the real or no real deal, i just wanted to have everything in one place, meaning the DLCs and the HiREs Texture pack, and now i got it, so either way, its not fake (and yes i did wrote this comment to the other torrents of this kind as well, i mean skyrim walmart)"
,papayrus,2013-06-11T07:22Z,OK screw it I am going to try it out some people peoples negative comments have made me hold back. I will give an honest rating when I get it installed. I don't care as long as it works the way it should and has all the stuff like it says.
