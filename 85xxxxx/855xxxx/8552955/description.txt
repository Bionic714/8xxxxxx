The second issue of the "Quisling" story will darken your very perception of mankind. Oliver has done the unthinkable... teamed with the Crossed in order to save his own worthless life. How far would you go under the guise of survival when the cost is the violation of everything that makes you human? Christos Gage spins a bleak story of betrayal that will leave you looking at civilization in a new and vile light.

There is no hope. There is no cure. There is only the Crossed.
