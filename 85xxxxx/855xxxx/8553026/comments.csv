,macfly59,2013-06-08T14:00Z,it's multi language ?
,russianhornybear,2013-06-08T15:55Z,hmm.. so basically this 1 just a ordinary game with 3 DLS and latest patch?
,brianxxx,2013-06-08T16:55Z,"@ russianhornybear
Basically I think so except this lil tidbit at the end of description which piques my interest - 
""Legendary difficulty mode for hardcore players, and Legendary skills - enabling you to master every perk and level up your skills infinitely."""
,CMS93,2013-06-09T03:26Z,Basically it's a pack with both fully updated game and dlcs. For those of us who prefer to download a single pack instead of several torrents.
,winshot,2013-06-09T10:00Z,Any chance of this getting a seyter repack... Thanks again Heromaster....
,InternetBatman,2013-06-09T10:17Z,"Is this real, I hear it is fake any confirmation before i commit my precious slow Australian bandwidth? Just confirmation it has the legendary difficulty will be enough."
,japichin,2013-06-09T14:17Z,"Compiled version (self-made walmart installer and very fast installation), only in English, the game works fine, and yes is the legendary version but not the official one rip. "
,Lunarbdog,2013-06-09T15:33Z,"Ummm ok so this is my first time downloading something from here and I assumed it was all free but when i downloaded this and ran it, it sent me to the steam workshop and said i had to pay. Im assuming that by extract the files it means download the torrent (which like i said i did), then i mounted the ISO and installed. Anyone tell me what im doin wrong?"
,richg67,2013-06-09T21:50Z,"Good job on the upload and all but I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

TSEV = The Scrolls Elder 5

Should be TESV yet all folders and shortcuts are TSEV...minor overlook"
,Washton,2013-06-10T08:18Z,"Crap file, won't run anything, and you WILL be stuck with a 13GB file that two file unlockers cannot get rid of"
,InternetBatman,2013-06-10T08:47Z,"Please can someone relay whether this has the legendary difficulty, I do not feel like wasting my time on a fake repack of the DLCs. DOES IT CONTAIN LEGENDARY DIFFICULTY only confirm if you have downloaded and tested..."
,everx7,2013-06-10T23:37Z,"I can only confirm, what ive tried, so far, maxed out the settings, looked at data files, there are high res textures and all the dlcs also my old saves worked perfectly, since i first played skyrim, changed graphics card, now i can run the game absolutely smoothly, before that i couldnt and the last thing, what for me confirms, even if its not the proper release that its like or is the LE, it has legendary difficulty, so if u were i dont know guessing what this is or hesitant that this will not be what u want, rest assured that u dont need skidrow or any other scene group or p2p group to make u a nice exact legit unchallenged Legendary edition, feel free to download and seed, honestly i didnt really cared about if its the real or no real deal, i just wanted to have everything in one place, meaning the DLCs and the HiREs Texture pack, and now i got it, so either way, its not fake"
,sherrypizza,2013-06-11T06:47Z,"It does have legendary difficulty, i can confirm that"
,vijaybalaji,2013-06-13T10:20Z,@everx7 thanks for the clarification 
,EtaronTenoris,2013-06-13T12:14Z,I can't even mount this!
