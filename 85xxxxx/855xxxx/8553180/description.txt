Ying Ke-Feng, head of Peerless Manor, is an expert swordsman whose escort business transports 200,000 taels of silver to the capital each year.

Rather than give up this important commission and let the martial world know of his precarious health he means to entrust the consignment to two young knights in his manor, Hsiang Ting and Yun Piao-Piao. As it happens, these two are also betrothed; clearly they have their swordsmanship in common

Sword.Stained.With.Royal.Blood.1981.DVDRIP.XVID.AC3.SUBBED-MAJESTiC   

Plot
THE SWORD STAINED WITH ROYAL BLOOD (1981) is a convoluted tale of the martial world adapted by screenwriter Ni Kuang from a novel by Louis Cha  It's evidentfrom this film that a lot of plot has been condensed and packed into 104 minutes. Things move fast and there's an awful lot of detail to take in, much of it complicated by frequent flashbacks. It has less action and more talk than usual. Until the big fight finale, most of the fights tend to be short bouts, either friendly ones or tests of opponents' skills.
