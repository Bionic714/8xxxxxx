A bit about the torrent:
This band is absolutely addictive, the upbeat swing mixed with the bits of electronic work with a base of poppy rock make The Raveners one of my favorite new finds of this year, I hope you give them a fair shake, I'd recommend 'You Gotta Swing' and 'Kill The Beast' as tryout tracks.
Hope you enjoy and please help seed, I won't seed for more than a couple months and others deserve to hear this awesome sound :-)


From Last.fm:
Singer/songwriter Jessy Howe and guitarist/producer Chris Muzik (Bligg, Adrian Stern, Kisha) formed “The Raveners” just a couple of months ago. Thanks to mx3.ch you can listen to their first radio single “You Gotta Swing” on national swiss radio DRS3. Now also on swiss radio channels Radio 105, Radio Zürisee, Radio Couleur 3, Radio Basel 1 and Internetradio 108. Watch the according videoclip on VIVA TV, SF2 Roboclip or Radio/TV 105.

Jessy remembers having composed the tune and almost all its lyrics while heading to go out. Quickly - so as not to forget the melody - she sung it onto Chris’ answering machine only to find that he had used her recorded voice in a speeded up version. They loved the idea and the change of tempo and finished the song as it can be heard today.

With bassist Géza Burghardt, keyboardist Dave McLeod and drummer Simon Kistler they truly are a ravishing lot. A lot… a whole lot of groove, plenty of crunchy rock n’ roll guitar and a subtle attitude à la the 30ties. Marvellous and delicious tunes that make you wanna shake, dance, sing and dream along as well. Jessy Howe’s voice however definitely does not agree with her angelic looks. You would believe a “darker” soul was in possession of such a lassie. Something fresh, something new, something ravishing… The Raveners!
