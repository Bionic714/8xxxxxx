NO AGENDA SHOW Episode 519 - Freemium Reporters  2013-06-06

From Wikipedia:

No Agenda is a podcast which takes place two times a week on Thursday and Sunday in the morning, hosted by Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak on the mevio network. The show is a free-flowing conversation that deconstructs recent news and media memes. Much of the appeal of the show comes from the odd couple relationship between the hosts. Adam Curry usually suggests theories about the news or world events, whereas John C. Dvorak is intended to present a more reasoned perspective, and as acting as the "Straight man" to Curry.

The show has no advertisers, instead relying on its listeners to voluntarily donate in either lump sums or a recurring plan (referred to by the hosts as the "Value for Value" model). The show also relies on their listeners (known as "Producers") to provide artwork and audio clips.
