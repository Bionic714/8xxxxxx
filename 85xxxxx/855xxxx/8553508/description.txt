Without ever making the music lose its distinctive trance character, Armin van Buuren released an album bursting with diversity. 'Mirage' has set forth a sound that doesn't let itself be caught in a one-style corner. Singles 'Full Focus', 'Not Giving Up On Love', 'This Light Between Us' and 'Drowning' all caused different impact, but exploding the global dancefloors they did. The fifth single taken from 'Mirage', is another new story to be told. For 'Feels So Good', Armin invited the vocal queen.
