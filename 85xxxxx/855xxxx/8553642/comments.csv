[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-08T20:32Z,"Side 1 of this album is some of Status Quo's best
music in years! Another reminder that Classic Rock from aging rockers who elevated the genre is still alive and well in 2013 !

Sure a few of the tracks that are Fiji-themed 
tracks are a bit corny but this is a movie comedy 
soundtrack.  It's never a good sign when Jon Lovitz is in your film, but keep in mind that Status Quo are the LEADS !!"
