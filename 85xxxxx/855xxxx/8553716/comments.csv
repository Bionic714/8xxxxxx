,ScottyD7421,2013-06-12T08:00Z,"Thanks for uploading lyrical1986, much appreciated.

V/9
A/8

Picture looks to be the same as the WebRip/Cam Audio going around but the audio is much better. On the Cam Audio rip the audio is very pitchy however this copy is a lot more deep which is better on the ears. There is however a slight echoey sound which might be caused by the bass being to low if that makes sense but it doesn't interfere with the movie. The movie goes for 1 hr and 8 minutes and seems to be complete however without seeing a retail copy I can't be sure if there are any deleted scenes.

Hope this helps"
,Nitroito,2013-06-16T01:03Z,@ScottyD7421: That's what e meant... i guess there's 20min cut out that might include final credits and some scenes... about quality i fully agree with you and looking to both audio samples there was a pretty good job removing the noises :D
