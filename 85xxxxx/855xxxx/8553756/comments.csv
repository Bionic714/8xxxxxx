Unbelievable! Perfect! You've fulfilled my request within a few hours! Hope I'm not asking too much from you.This what I wanted.I'm deeply indebted to you.Danke--Merci beaucoup.

 Your concern is justified.It's difficult to find this torrent  through the searchbox,especially under the correct name.Hope moderator does something about it./_  ^ ^ _/ Peace. 

Thanks again."
[T],penfag,2013-06-08T21:16Z,Thanks for this post.  You did a nice job cleaning up the source files.  The misspelling is a real drag and I wish TPB would allow uploaders to edit their own file descriptions!

[T],pharmakate,2013-06-09T05:07Z,"@crowzero -- Yup, I know, the torrent will never be found in searches now. And you're welcome, it really was no trouble.

@penfag -- I'd really like to see a ""preview"" page before hitting the ""add to index"" button. That would eliminate most problems of this kind, as well as the problem of never being totally sure if piratebay will actually recognize all the characters pasted in the description box."
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-09T05:08Z,"@dm1969 -- The torrent itself, and all the files, are named correctly, it's just the ""torrent name"" field on the tpb webpage that is screwed up."
