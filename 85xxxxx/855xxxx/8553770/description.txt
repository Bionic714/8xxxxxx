After the suicide of her only friend, Rachel has never felt more on the outside.
The one person who reached out to her, Jessie, also happens to be part of the
popular crowd that lives to torment outsiders like her. But Rachel has
something else that separates her from the rest, a secret amazing ability to
move things with her mind. Sue Snell, the only survivor of Carrie White's
rampage twenty-two years ago, may hold the key to helping Rachel come to
terms with her awesome, but unwanted power. But as Rachel slowly learns to
trust, a terrible trap is being laid for her. And making her angry could prove to
be fatal. Rated R
