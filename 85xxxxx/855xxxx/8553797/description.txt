Remember to previously uninstall whatsapp if you come from the official version (if 

not you will get the "not installed" error)

What is WhatsApp+?

Basically it is a customizable WhatsApp where you can change lots of colours, sizes, 

and many other visual MODs

In addition you can increase upload media limit (stock limit is 16Mb) to send large 

music files or videos

You can increase quality of pictures sent (by default resolution is decreased quite a 

lot)

You can share music just with one click

You can add contact profile pictures to their chats

You can hide contact profile pictures and show phonebook pictures (in chat screen)

Built-in theme viewer and downloader. Check WhatsApp+ users themes online and apply 

theme if you like
