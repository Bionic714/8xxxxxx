Additional Info:

Resolution was untouched in the conversion. The source is from a PAL DVD so the resolution is 720x576 (576i)

The series is shot in Canada, and to put it in a nice way, the cameras they used wern't exactly A+ equipment. That's why some scenes appear grainy. It's not the conversion to DVD, the grainyness was there on Showtime and when the show was syndicated on TV.

Children of the Gods has DD 5.1 audio. All the rest have DD 2.0 surround audio. That is how it was released on the DVD.

Last bit of info, since these are from the DVD box set. Children of the Gods is the edited version that was released for syndication. So no full frontal nude scene. You will have to find an unedited version from elsewhere if that is an issue for you.
