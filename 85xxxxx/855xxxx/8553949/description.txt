Chef Wanted with Anne Burrell - Season 1, Episode 6 (Season Finale)



Boston Hot Spot

Met Back Bay, a 200-seat restaurant in the heart of Boston that does more than 1,200 covers a day, has just lost its executive chef and needs someone who can handle quantity without sacrificing quality. Anne brings four candidates to owner Kathy Sidell, who is a top restaurateur in Boston with a reputation to uphold. The chefs are asked to create a signature burger, as well as to create as many entrees as they can in 45 minutes. The two finalists each get the keys to the restaurant for one dinner service. One chef brings an innovative menu but struggles to handle the volume while the other starts off great before losing footing at the end. It's a big job for a big restaurant, and only one walks away with the title of executive chef.
