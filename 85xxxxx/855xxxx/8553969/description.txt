Larry Gets Trashed and Tanked
Premiere Date:June 05, 2013 - 09:00-10:00PM ET
Larry is on a mission to show how America is the land of the great ideas and finds all the evidence he needs on a road trip through Minnesota. The adventure starts on an extremely stinky note as Larry works with a farmer who turns restaurant scraps into a nutritious feed for his hogs. Larry then shows up at the doorsteps of Minnesotans responsible for three major inventions: the Post-It Note, the Nerf Ball and the game of Twister! After a weird side trip to a beard and mustache competition, Larry concludes on a highly destructive note at an innovative business called "Drive-a-Tank." It don't get much more "Only in America."
