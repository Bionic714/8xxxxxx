Description
Minecraft - Pocket Edition is a Universal App! Play on any iPhone and iPad. It's constantly evolving thanks to our free updates.

Minecraft is about placing blocks to build things and going on adventures!

Pocket Edition includes randomly generated worlds, multiplayer over a local Wi-Fi network, and Survival and Creative modes. You can craft and create with your friends anywhere in the world so long as you have hands spare and battery to burn. 

Our most recent update added the iconic Creepers. They're big, green, mean and explody. But it's just one of many. Since Minecraft - Pocket Edition first appeared, we're continuing to add loads of new features, including...

- Support for the iPhone 5's widescreen display
- Food! Now you can cook and go hungry
- Swords! Bows! TNT! Armor!
- Chests
- Skeletons
- Spiders
- Beds
- Paintings
- Lots more!

But enough sales talk! Download it already! Have fun!
