Workdone:
Since the R6 was grainy, color where off and had chinese subs, We decided to go with YanKeeS 720p. Source was actually really good just had a few issues like lighting and perspective was off. After we got all that sorted out, we ran a few other filters to make it look a lot better. We took the R6 beginning and end credits from UNiQUE version to make it a full video and added the end scene credits from Hive-CM8 version. We did notice few spots around the one hour mark where 2 people walk by and we decided to leave it in since it was just a few seconds at a time. For the audio we used UNiQUE's and lip sync it up with our version. We hope you all enjoy this and im sure someone will complain like always.
