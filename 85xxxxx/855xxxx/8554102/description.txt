On request the Porcupine Tree (Big Fan especially from the Carrier of Magic lead singer Steven Wilson) playlist. The list is a contraction of two earlier lists: Time Flies and Disappear. May explain some confusion.... Never heard of Porcupine Tree and you like some Symphonic Rock (like Genesis or Phil Collins) its dearly recommended..... Enjoy,
