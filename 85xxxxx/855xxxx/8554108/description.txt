Kay and Arnold are a middle-aged couple whose marriage has declined until they
are now sleeping in separate rooms and barely interact in any meaningful loving
way. Finally, Kay has had enough and finds a book by Dr. Feld which inspires her
to sign them up for the Doctor's intense week long marriage counseling session.
Although Arnold sees nothing wrong with their 30 year long marriage, he
reluctantly agrees to go on the expensive excursion. What follows is an insightful
experience as Dr. Feld manages to help the couple understand how they have
emotionally drifted apart and what they can do to reignite their passion. Even
with the Doctor's advice, Kay and Arnold find that renewing their marriage's fire is a daunting challenge for them both. Rated PG-13
