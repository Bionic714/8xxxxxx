The game is set several years after the events of Warriors Orochi 2. After the resurrected Orochi was defeated, the warriors of the Three Kingdoms era of China and the Warring States period of Japan began to rebuild their lives in the twisted dimensional world. However, their peace was disturbed by the appearance of an eight-headed serpent beast dubbed as "Hydra". Combined with a mysteriously revived Kiyomori Taira and his acolytes, the Hydra began its attack on humanity. Many of the warriors of the Three Kingdoms and Warring States lost their lives battling the Demon Army. In a desperate bid to defeat the Hydra, the remnants of humanity, dubbed the "Resistance Army", led by Sima Zhao, Ma Chao, and Hanbei Takenaka, made an all-out attack on the Demon Army's main camp. The disastrous attack ends in the Resistance Army being completely routed, but the three warriors are spared, due to the intervention of the Moon Princess Kaguya, who transports the three back in time to a time just prior to their ill-fated attack.
