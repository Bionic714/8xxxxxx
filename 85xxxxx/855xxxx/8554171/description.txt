"Instantly engaging and eminently accessible . . . . an enlightening and cautionary exploration of an increasingly intrusive aspect of modern society." ΓÇöBooklist

While the Internet can enhance well-being, Elias Aboujaoude has spent years treating patients whose lives have been profoundly disturbed by it. Part of the danger lies in how the Internet allows us to act with exaggerated confidence, sexiness, and charisma. Aboujaoude dubs this new self our ΓÇ£e-personalityΓÇ¥ and argues that its traits are too potent to be confined online. Offline, too, weΓÇÖre becoming impatient, unfocused, and urge-driven. Virtually You draws from AboujaoudeΓÇÖs personal and professional experience to highlight this new phenomenon. The first scrutiny of the virtual worldΓÇÖs transformative power on our psychology, Virtually You demonstrates how real life is being reconfigured in the image of a chat room, and how our identity increasingly resembles that of our avatar.
