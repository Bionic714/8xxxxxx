Notorious for playing cards and women, he knows when to hold ΓÇÖem, when to walk away, and when to runΓÇöand heΓÇÖs got skills at the poker table too. But CharlieΓÇÖs ready to change his ways, and the surprisingly sexy texts heΓÇÖs getting from Riley are making him want to bet everythingΓÇªon her.

Riley Carter is nothing like the hotel heiresses who make the news. A girl whoΓÇÖs determined to run her fatherΓÇÖs hotel empire canΓÇÖt share many traits with women who fill the gossip rags. But when living in Vegas, a straight-laced life can be stiflingΓÇªand ΓÇÿthe DevilΓÇÖ has a way of tempting even the best-behaved girls.

When Riley discovers the naughty messages on her new cell havenΓÇÖt been coming from ΓÇ£Mr. RightΓÇ¥ but from Charlie, she falls into a hot affair with the last man she expected. But consorting with the notorious bad boy puts her hard-won reputation on the line, and Riley must decide if the poker player is more to her than a little TEXT APPEAL.
