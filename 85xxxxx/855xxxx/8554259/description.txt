Hi,

In a time Obama is not even capable to put a little less bullets in your guns and make the rich to take their part in our common responsibility, it is time for some repetition on request (along with some nice music for some comfort and support).

PS: On advice some keywords are added to get some attention: terror, bomb, guns, plane , power, taxes, victims, rights (enough I hope)


Hi,

An unlikely attempt to reach president Obama. Most other possibilities are blocked (makes you think, especially when you are the president). I have a plan that only has a chance when asked for by the right people (Sometimes it is like that, Obama will understand).

There is only one reason this unlikely event (idealistic ideaΓÇÖs have become a necessity) might happen and that is when we recognize a chance. No matter how small. So please seed.

Music is a way to communicate and sometimes it can even be a bridge.

Enjoy
