  Anomaly 2 is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Anomaly 
  Warzone Earth. Maintaining the core elements of the original, 
  Anomaly 2 adds new features to the single-player campaign and 
  finally puts your skills to a test in a completely unique 
  experience: the dynamic tower defense vs. tower offense 
  multiplayer mode!

  In the years following the invasion of Earth in 2018, the planet 
  is overrun by alien machines. Humankind is on the verge of 
  extinction. Banded together in huge convoys, they search the 
  frozen tundra for food and supplies. Since the war, the roles 
  have been reversed: now our species seems to be the Anomaly on a 
  machine-controlled planet. Your convoy, Commander, is called 
  Yukon.

  Anomaly 2 takes the RTS tower-offense concept from Anomaly 
  Warzone Earth to a new level. The core elements of the original ┬û 
  tactical planning and the on-field Commander to support troops in 
  combat ┬û are spiced up by a number of important new features.
