[T],pharmakate,2013-06-09T04:43Z,"If you try to convert this PDF to another format like epub or mobi, please understand the results will be very poor.

I invite anyone with patience to produce a reflowable file and proofread and format it."
[T],Max-Upload,2013-06-09T22:55Z,My torrent is not from your PDF first of all it's from an epub and I could not convert it and upload it in such a limited time we release our torrents the same day. Your torrent was criticized for bad quality not mine
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-10T01:28Z,"I haven't seen any criticism of the quality of this file. If anyone finds any problems, please leave a note."
,ManiacalJim,2013-06-10T16:37Z,"While your torrent file itself is fine, your very halfassed and hardly accurate description of the novel is lacking."
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-10T17:22Z,@ManiacalJim - Now that's a statement I can entirely agree with.
