Freedom always comes at a costΓÇª

The fallen were never named, therefore we go by our human names, names given to us by people who use to worship us. IΓÇÖm Athena, one thing you need to know about me? I hate having to protect the human race, but my job as Seeker asks me to do just thatΓÇöso that one day, I can earn a spot in heaven.

My father is the leader of the Phantoms, so IΓÇÖm pretty sure that the archangels think of me as a flight risk, maybe thatΓÇÖs why they gave me the most gorgeous and annoying partner in all of Halceyon, Adonis.

His kisses give me strength, his presence soothes my soulΓÇöbut our love, is completely forbidden.

There is a war coming, and now that the Titans have been released, itΓÇÖs been brought to my front door. One thing is for certainΓÇöIΓÇÖm going to have to make a choice, and IΓÇÖm not sure I have the strength to make the right one, not anymore. Not after meeting Seth, not after my best friendΓÇÖs betrayal, and not after I meet my father face to face and learn the truthΓÇöI may be exactly like him.


Seed and Enjoy!
