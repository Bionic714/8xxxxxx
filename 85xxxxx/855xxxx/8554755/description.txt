
Bob Dylan – Biograph [1985] [only1joe] FLAC-EAC

Biograph is a 53-track box set compilation spanning the career of Bob Dylan, from his 1962 debut album to the 1981 release Shot of Love. Released in 1985 by Columbia Records, as both a five-LP and a three-compact disc set, it was the first compact disc box set retrospective issued for a musical artist.[citation needed] It reached #33 on the Billboard 200 in the US and has been certified platinum by the RIAA
The recordings on Biograph are a mix of rarities, hit singles, and album tracks. They are not presented in chronological order; 18 of its 53 tracks had not been previously issued, and three more had only been previously available on singles. The set comes accompanied with a 42-page booklet, containing rare photos and liner notes by Cameron Crowe, who interviews Dylan about each of the tracks. Nine of the ten tracks from Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits appear on this compilation..
