Glad to hear it! I didnt think anyone would be interested in anything other then zombies. I WILL be uploading the original The Monster Hunter's Survival Guide graphic novel very soon also!"

I have to warn you, it's not like a traditional graphic novel, its more like a novel, with one or two pictures per page. It's really good if you're into monster lore, but it's nothing like the Case Files though!"
