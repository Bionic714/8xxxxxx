At the very beginning the dude with the camera is setting it up and it's off centre. Unfortunately he never fixes it so the whole movie is lopsided. The picture itself is a bit blurry. The audio isn't terrible but out of sync by at least 1 whole second, doesn't sound like much but trust me it is. Of course you can sync it yourself using VLC etc. but at 1.33GB with a tilted screen I'd personally wait for a better copy.

Cheers
