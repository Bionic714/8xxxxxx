,Encrypt3d,2013-06-09T16:38Z,Thank you sir!
[V],QborT,2013-06-09T16:45Z,You're all welcome... 15 more episodes and an OVA still coming!!!
,MrCanuck,2013-06-09T23:07Z,"Hey Qbort,

First, thanks for uploading these. Appreciated. 

However, I'm having difficulty finding episodes 8 and 9, and they don't seem to show up either in the search or your own torrents. Have you in fact uploaded them, or am I just looking in the wrong places?

Thanks again."
[V],QborT,2013-06-09T23:47Z,"MrCanuck, you just need to search for the shows original Japanese title.  Adding the English title at the end was just something I did for uploading here so you won't see it on the others.

k1ng_ruLz was quick to upload episodes 8 and 9... and might possibly beat me to more in the future, so just bookmark the link above and you shouldn't have a problem. :D"
,terrencejsh,2013-06-10T06:44Z,this anime puts all others to shame. every episode just gets better
,Exevier,2013-06-13T07:37Z,"QborT, when you say there are 15 more episodes coming, is that how many are planned for the whole series?

I seem to be having trouble finding any solid information on how long it's supposed to be, if the source manga is still running, etc."
[V],QborT,2013-06-13T17:52Z,"Exevier, to the best of my knowledge all 25 episodes will be aired as season 1 (but I could be wrong of course).  And the OVA will be released in December (side story about Ilse Langner journal/notebook)

The Manga is still currently running (started in 2009 and just released #46 a couple days ago)."
,Exevier,2013-06-14T00:42Z,"QborT, gotcha! Thanks for the information and the uploads, of course!"
,MrCanuck,2013-06-15T19:08Z,"@Qbort

Much appreciated, friend."
