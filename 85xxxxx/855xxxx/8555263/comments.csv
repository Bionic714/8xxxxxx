,snow_wolf_666,2013-06-09T10:13Z,why the WEB-DL version losts about 30 seconds of the screen that Airachnid fighting the Terrorcon Silas? :'( The HDTV version still has it. 
[T],loadstone2k12,2013-06-09T11:46Z,"snow_wolf_666 Was released on iTunes that way, don't know if it was by mistake or some kind of censorship.

If the full version becomes available, I'll make a PROPER release."
