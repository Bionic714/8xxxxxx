  Personal memories can now be digitised, bought, sold and traded. The last
  remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be
  a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the
  beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this
  surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can
  provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a
  handful of people.
 
  Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role
  of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into
  people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities,
  fearful of her knowledge and capabilities arrested Nilin and wiped her
  memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to
  recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend. This search for
  her past leads to her being hunted by the very people that created this
  surveillance society. During the course of the story, Nilin will start
  remembering who she was and re-learning all the fighting moves that made her
  one of the world's leading memory hunters.
