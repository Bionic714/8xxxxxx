A 3 part dramatisation, by the always excellent Bert Coules, of J B Priestley's 1965 autobiographical novel.

It is 1913 and young Richard Herncastle leaves his dead end job to join his despotic uncle (played by former Dr Who Tom Baker), one of the country's leading illusionists, to work in his music hall act. He discovers the joy of performing in front of a live audience, the rivalry between performers, and the despair when a performer is no longer wanted by his audience. He falls in love with Nancy (of Susie, Nancy and a gentleman), is seduced by the ageing failed actress Julie Blane, and witnesses both suicide and murder, before embarking for the wholesale slaughter of the trenches of the Western Front.

A beautifully crafted work, by a writer and adapter at the top of their respective games..
