,Calel1234,2013-06-09T13:56Z,Thanks for ul! I was wondering what happened after #8. 
,shexxy,2013-06-10T06:05Z,Thank you so much for this! I'm buying hard copies of these as I find them too. May I make a request for Dodgem Logic? I hope those make their way to this side of the Atlantic and Moore continues to be able to do underground work which is also (physically) accessible.
