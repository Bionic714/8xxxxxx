How ridiculous that my upload of this book was converted by someone into something so completely unusable.

My version is pretty nice, though."
[T],Max-Upload,2013-06-09T22:56Z,Please don't post such nonsense on my torrent on KAT they said your quality was bad the seeders upload and download what they want
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-10T00:26Z,"Anyone who actually downloaded my version of this book and looked at it can see it's the best version around. If you think your files are good quality, then you haven't looked at your own files.

Someone may have mixed up the two torrents and criticized mine, since they download to the same folder.

And I assume you got your original epub through mobilism, then converted it to mobi and pdf. The person who posted the epub on mobilism did it about an hour after I posted my torrent. Obviously that person used calibre or some other tool to do a straight conversion of my pdf to epub. With completely shitty results, as expected.

For anyone looking for a good epub/mobi version, none has been released yet. "
