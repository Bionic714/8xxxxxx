The unlucky day in question belongs to a certain Italian dude -- think Woody Allen álà Naples -- whose bombshell wife seems to do nothing all day but soil the ol' conjugal sheets with rogue cocksmen and elegant couples. The dialogue is all in Italian, but the storyline seems to have something to do with the really rotten day had by our hero -- he ends it by getting butt-raped (suggested, not shown) -- and the agency of his little 'ho of a wife in bringing that 24-hour bit o' hell to bear.

The talent here consists of a mouth-watering array of Italian beauties of the southern type -- dreamy dark eyes, all-natural hips, tits and lips. A veritable banquet of Mediterranean splendor it is. The most memorable sex on tap is the d.p. to which the erring wife in question happily lends her pussy and bung. Also hot is a threesome featuring a studly young buck, an older blonde and a juicy young ragazzina who kind of resembles Michael Corleone's bride Apollonia in The Godfather.

Sadly, though, much of the sex is a little stilted and sometimes even uncomfortable to watch, as when the comely young missy does whatever she can to avoid kissing the guy who's fucking her in the ass. Still, the sheer aesthetic value of the leading ladies is enough to keep most fans of Eurotica more than happy.
