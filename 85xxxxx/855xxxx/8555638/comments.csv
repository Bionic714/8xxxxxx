In this episode:

1. I'll tell you a bit about hip hop, and its history, but not too much because I don't want to bore you.

2. We'll listen to some hip hop and have a look at the lyrics and analyse them. I'll explain them, and kind of give you my thoughts on them.

There is music in the background on this one. I thought it was appropriate because of the subject of this episode. Future episodes will not always have music, but this one does. If you really can't hear what I'm saying then let me know and I might be able to upload this episode again without the background music. If you like the music and would like to hear more, let me know by commenting on this episode. I should be able to recommend some albums or tracks for you."

This episode is all about the story of a hardcore punk rock band from London. Listen, and you'll hear an interview with the band members as they talk about how the band started, their influences, and what caused the band to end.

The band is called Salvo. They started in London in 2002 and played gigs in London, Oxford and Manchester before breaking up 4 years later. This interview was done recently. For the first time in years, most of the members of the group were all in the same room at the same time, so I had to take the opportunity to interview them for Luke's English Podcast
