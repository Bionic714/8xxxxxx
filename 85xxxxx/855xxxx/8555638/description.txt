Who is Luke?
Hi, IΓÇÖm Luke and IΓÇÖm an English Language teacher from London.

IΓÇÖve been teaching  English for over 11 years. I started in Japan and lived in Kanagawa prefecture for two years. Since then IΓÇÖve been teaching in London and I regularly teach courses in business English, academic English, legal English, general English and English for exam courses like FCE, IELTS and BEC.

I graduated from Liverpool John MooreΓÇÖs University in 1999 with a BA Hons degree in Media and Cultural Studies. I worked at various media production companies before going into English language teaching. I took my CELTA in 2001 and then my DELTA in 2006 at UCL. I now teach full time in a language school in London.

I am a prolific writer of ELT materials, and I often design courses in EAP for which I usually write the material. I have written original courses for English for the Pharmaceutical Industry, English for the Oil and Gas Industries and English for Journalists. I am a semi-published author with some of my work being used in materials publications in several countries.

I started LukeΓÇÖs English Podcast in 2009 and since then it has become enormously popular. I plan to continue writing material and publishing episodes of the podcast before hopefully publishing material of my own and expanding my website.

I am also a musician and a comedian. I play drums and bass in several bands, and I regularly perform stand-up comedy in London. 

I sincerely hope you enjoy listening to LukeΓÇÖs English Podcast and that you find it improves your English. Check my other pages to find useful advice for learning English, and for how to use the podcast as a good way to improve your English in many areas.
