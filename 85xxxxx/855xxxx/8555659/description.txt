Description:


A new twist on ZOMBIES with action, horror and the uncomfortably recognizable in the old West! A stop-lossed Army vet. A president in office without the popular vote. A terror crisis gripping the nation. Meet William Wade, newly minted and seriously resentful secret agent for President Rutherford B. Hayes. His mission with cerebral partner J.J. Flynn: travel the West and investigate outbreaks of the living dead -- each one more horrifyingly advanced than the last. 1877 is turning out to be one rotten year.
