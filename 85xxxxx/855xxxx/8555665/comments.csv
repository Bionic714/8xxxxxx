First of all another 1000 thanks for re-seeding of 
* Euro Zone Dance Hits 2007 [Video Album]
Btw, if the other collections where we some files are not complete yet, it would help us if you'd re-seed even the files you found in your archives. This especially at downloads:
- My Recent Video Collection Vol 2 (MPEG2) [Video Album]
- October 2009 Hot Hits (Promo Only Canada) [Video Album]
- December 2009 Promo Only UK (VOB Files) [Video Album]
- July 2009 UK Video Pool [Video Album]
- June 2009 UK Pop
- 1971 & 1972 Hits (For VJ Use playing on a PC or MAC) [Video Album]
- 1980's Request Album
Hope you can help us with this request, too :-) would be great! Tom B."

The contents will be the same so all you do is save to the same path as before and you should resume the download from the point where the last seed left the swarm."
