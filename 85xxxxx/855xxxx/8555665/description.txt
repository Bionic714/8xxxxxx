RE SEED Request:  I can not keep every torrent I have ever produced seeded.  I have not got the bandwidth.   I can not keep every raw video file I have ever seeded on the system.  I have only got 16TB of data storage!!!!

But the ones I still have on the system which are 'stuck' due to the activities of the many Hit and Run Pirate bay users will be re seeded over the next week or so.  Just point the data save file over your partial download to resume from where you got STUCK!
