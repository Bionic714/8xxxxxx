5.0 out of 5 stars Hard'n'heavy - alive and kicking 3 Jun 2010 
By Golovanov Alexey 
Format:Audio CD

For anyone who likes classic hard rock, "Poobah" from Ohio is simply a must - it might easily fill a few gaps and bring back some nostalgic memories. Perhaps it lacks some finesse, but it is pure spontaneous merciless hard rock, strongly influenced by Deep Purple and Hendrix, full-heartedly performing "Rock'n'roll" (from Zeppelin IV), etc, etc. Mature band dating back to the 70s. Strongly recommended

5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing guitar work,great vocals,songs. 9 Nov 2009 
By Guitarfan - Published on Amazon.com
Format:Audio CD

This album from the late 70's is some of the best hard rock I have ever heard. Simply amazing guitar rock,with really wild ,fast guitar playing by Jim Gustafson. He surprises you with song after good song ,just bursting with impressive playing.The bass and drums are top notch ,too, and could stand up to any other band in thier ability.It is a mystery why this album did not become as big as Cream,Van Halen,Sabbath,Purple,Ac/Dc.ect. Powerful stuff.I love this CD and you will too.

4.0 out of 5 stars Good late 70s hard rock 17 May 2007 
By Audiologicist - Published on Amazon.com
Format:Audio CD

Whoever wrote the "About The Artist" and "Product Description" above is a long winded shuck n jive airhead, so I will now put the record straight. This, simply put, is good solid heavy guitar driven hard rock from late 70s Ohio USA. There is a progressive element involved throughout, but above all it is simply straight ahead hard rock. The band is centered around guitarist/lead singer/main songwriter Jim Gustafson, and especially on this release, the songs and musicianship are dead on. Enough variety in the song structure is there to keep it interesting. There's no deep meaning or complication to any of the songs, but if late 70s hard rock is what you want... dive in and enjoy. There now, wasn't that easier to read than the overblown hype above?

5.0 out of 5 stars Hard'n'Heavy Resurrection 5 Jan 2010 
By Golovanov Alexey - Published on Amazon.com
Format:Audio CD

There is no need to beat around the bush after an excellent editorial review and description. A quite competent rival to "Deep Purple" (with Gillan) and "Zeppelin" (there is honest rendition of "Rock'n'roll" from LZ IV)strongly influenced by Jimi Hendrix (aren't they all?). The performance in general (and vocals) might lack the finesse, but this is spontaneous, agressive rough music. An absolutely smashing album and great band - far superiour to any anemic stoners mongering some miserable noise pollution.

P.S. I feel ashamed to forget about this band - God bless Amazon for reminding
