ΓÇ£Y. That perfect letter. The wishbone, fork in the road, empty wineglass. The question we ask over and over. Why? . . . My life begins at the Y.ΓÇ¥ So opens Marjorie CelonaΓÇÖs highly acclaimed and exquisitely rendered debut about a wise-beyond-her-years foster child abandoned as a newborn on the doorstep of the local YMCA. Swaddled in a dirty gray sweatshirt with nothing but a Swiss Army knife tucked between her feet, little Shannon is discovered by a man who catches only a glimpse of her troubled mother as she disappears from view. That morning, all three lives are forever changed. Bounced between foster homes, Shannon endures abuse and neglect until she finally finds stability with Miranda, a kind but no-nonsense single mother with a free-spirited daughter of her own. Yet Shannon defines life on her own terms, refusing to settle down, and never stops longing to uncover her rootsΓÇöespecially the stubborn question of why her mother would abandon her on the day she was born.

Brilliantly and hauntingly interwoven with ShannonΓÇÖs story is the tale of her mother, Yula, a girl herself who is facing a desperate fate in the hours and days leading up to ShannonΓÇÖs birth. As past and present converge, Y tells an unforgettable story of identity, inheritance, and, ultimately, forgiveness. CelonaΓÇÖs ravishingly beautiful novel offers a deeply affecting look at the choices we make and what it means to be a family, and it marks the debut of a magnificent new voice in contemporary fiction.
