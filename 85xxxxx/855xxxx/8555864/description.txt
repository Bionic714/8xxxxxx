The Symphonie fantastique (Op.14) recorded on "authentic" period instruments by the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique under the direction of John Eliot Gardiner. Recorded 1991 at the venue where the 1830 premiere occurred, the Ancien Conservatoire in Paris, and released on Phillips CD in 1993.

The sound is a little dry, but paradoxically it is an excellent recording in its own way. I suggest turning down the treble a notch, turning up the bass a notch, turning OFF "loudness" or "bass boost" function if any, and turning up the volume control a bit higher than usual. If you follow these instructions, this recording will provide a lifetime of listening enjoyment.

Also included in this torrent is the recently discovered Messe solennelle from 1825, an early work Berlioz thought he had destroyed, or claimed to have destroyed. It's interesting primarily because melodic ideas from the Mass found their way into the Symphonie fantastique and also (allegedly) the Requiem (Op.5) (I don't know the Requiem so well, so I can't confirm this, but Wikipedia says so).
This is the 1994 world premiere recording, performed by the same forces as above, plus the Monteverdi Choir.
