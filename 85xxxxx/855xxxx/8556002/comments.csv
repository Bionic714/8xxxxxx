,Calamity-TPB,2013-06-13T07:31Z,"Sigh. One, Warner Bros. is a very old company with very old products in its long history. So not only is it routine for old studios like it to release or re-release new DVD/Blu-ray editions for their old titles, but it's actually quite necessary. Two, that's NOT even the issue here, mister. How is ""Warner being late"" the uploaders' fault? The issue, is the people above rudely berating AND accusing the good uploaders of sharing a fake release, without searching for the facts first. Thus, the well-deserved ""gobsmakkin"" that @Namorax referred to. 'That clear enough for ya, mister?"
