Back in 1970s, this island was known as the "Lumber Island". It abounded

in rare wood species of the highest quality, which were sought for by the

craftsmen from all over the world - many of them took trips to the island

in person, to pick the best material.  The island thrived on private manu-

factures and tourism... ...until deposits of oil were found under it. This

finding doomed the island: its inhabitants were made to leave their home

land, the wood was chopped down to the ground.  And after the oil had been

pumped out to the last drop, the island was left abandoned and totally

exhausted.  This is the official story. The real truth lying behind it is

for you to discover...
