For the Bible Tells Me So is a 2007 American documentary film directed by Daniel G. Karslake about homosexuality and its perceived conflict with Christianity, as well as various interpretations of what the Bible says about same-sex sexuality.

It includes lengthy interview segments with several sets of religious parents (including former House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt and his wife, Jane, and the parents of Bishop V. Gene Robinson) regarding their personal experiences raising homosexual children, and also interviews with those (adult) children.

The film features an animated segment, "Is Homosexuality a Choice?", in which a summary of the current scientific theories about sexual orientation is given. It is directed by Powerhouse Animation Studios and narrated by Don LaFontaine in one of his last non-trailer narration roles.

The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.

The film received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that the film received 98% positive reviews, based on 43 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 11 reviews.
