Overview:

Terror. Violence. Madness. Bedlam. A holiday paradise gone mad. A tropical island turns into total chaos after a mysterious zombie outbreak. Cut off from the rest of the world, the playerΓÇÖs only chance to survive is to fight to the death and find a way to escape from the island.

Dead Island combines first-person action with a heavy focus on melee combat, character development and customization of a vast array of weapons. All of these gameplay features are presented in a dark story inspired by classic zombie movies with a gritty and engrossing campaign that can be played with up to four players in co-op mode.

Set in an open world tropical island, hordes of different festering zombies await players around every corner while they embark on a variety of thrilling missions through the holiday resort. With firearms and ammunition being scarce the player must rely on utilizing found items as weapons for self-defense and fight off zombie hordes in intense melee combat. A diverse range of items can be collected and will later serve to transform the playerΓÇÖs ordinary makeshift weapons into serious instruments of destruction.

In addition to satisfying even the most bloodthirsty action fanΓÇÖs fantasy, Dead Island also features role-playing elements which allow the player to develop one of the gameΓÇÖs unique character classes according to their preferences, all the while learning new skills and fresh tactics during their journey through the perilous environments of the island.
