It sure would be nice if Jerry would release his other late 1950s
NBC specials that were also shot in color.  He has the original videotapes,
and this is one of them! Lewis had one of his sons work with a company
to restore parts of the audio to the video. A short feature of that is included.

This was his third special and actually a drama based on the decades-old play
that had starred Al Jolson.  The big difference is that Jerry plays a 
jazz singer who is also a comedian.  Jolson's character was a cantor.

Ernest Glucksman had previously produced The Colgate Comedy Hour -- 
but just the shows with Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.
