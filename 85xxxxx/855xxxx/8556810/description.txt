Welcome to Tim Timebomb and Friends. This site is a place for me to put out a new song everyday. Some of the songs are my own originals, some are collaborations Ive done with other artists, bandmates, and friends. We play a lot of different style from Punk, Ska, Reggae ,Country, Roots etc. WeΓÇÖve been putting out our own music videos, lyric videos, and animation you guys can check out too. If you like a song on the site and wanna add it to your collection you can buy it on iTunes a few weeks after we release it or listen to it for free on youtube and figure out how to rip it from there!!! Thanks for checking out our site we appreciate your support.
