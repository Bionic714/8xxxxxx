,LukeBongwater,2013-06-10T06:42Z,"Hey there.. First of all thank you for the uploads, they are great : ) I have been downloading these for a long time and this is the first time I have a Question.. I installed Dragon Valley and it shows up as the gold version that includes all the extra items in the installed items tab on the Sims 3 launcher, but when I go into the game none of the Dragon Valley gold items are there to buy. I am kinda confused on this??? The world works great and the dragons are fine, along with the festival grounds and Duke of Bows lot as well. I also put the 041 thru 049 package files in like I do every month replacing the previous version. Should I remove this file and go back to the May update? I was thinking it may be conflicting with the Dagon Valley world since the June update only consisted of the Dragon Valley stuff anyways??? Any help here would be much appreciated :) If its just the regular Dragon Valley its fine but it seemed strange that all the gold content shows up as installed though???"
,LukeBongwater,2013-06-10T07:18Z,"Ok Nevermind that last comment... I figured it out. Everything works great now. All I did was move the store fix update out of the packages folder and started the game and they all showed up. After, I put the store fix back in its place and it still works so I have no clue what that was all about. Anyways thank you again for the great stuff :)"

,lorina1,2013-06-12T20:27Z,"I'm having a problem with the Archery object. The animations work but it doesn't appear neither the bow nor the arrows when doing it. With the violin, the music plays and the animations are fine, but when there is not skill bar while practicing it nor icon for the skill in the Skill Panel. 
I know they're not crucial issues. But I wonder, what I am missing? Help please."
