  With a intervening four year gap, during which heΓÇÖs moved house, learnt to play even more instruments and generally further reorganised life around his music, Images Rolling provides the world with another kaleidoscopic mixture of live instruments, pleasantly ambling soundtracks and moments of orchestral splendour, all intertwined with suggestive tinges of psychedelic rock (see Is History).

  Magic ArmΓÇÖs inter-continental and more often retrospective style, mixes modern and vintage ideals, summoning up a contemporary appeal that he lovingly mingles with a uniquely rose tinted view of late ΓÇÖ60ΓÇÖs flowered up pop. Whilst his outlook may seem lavish at various junctures, the intimacy of this project remains. The tunes remain highly personal, intricate and more importantly, intensely appealing. The music and performances, are of course perfectly credible, with nothing  left to the vagaries (or luxuries) of a computerΓÇÖs cutting room folder.

  In short, Images Rolling appears to be an individualΓÇÖs long awaited masterpiece. A relaxed effort, thatΓÇÖs been carefully considered with only the ripest of ideas making the final cut. Nearer the end of the album, you really do feel as though you have been taken on a journey. Under The Eaves is a contradiction in simplicity versus complexity. The chords are easy to remember, but the layering and overall arrangement builds up to a gentle crescendo, that for Rigelsford is pleasantly epic.
