Serious Sam is a high-adrenaline arcade-action shooter heavily focused on

frantic arcade-style single player action. In a world where cyberpunk

meets fantasy-fiction and advanced technology is mixed with black magic

and psycho-powers, Sam travels through the beautiful world of ancient Egypt

and several diverse planets, confronting countless Mental's minions on his

way to the Mental's base.
