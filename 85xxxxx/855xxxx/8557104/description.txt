Respect Yourself is an authoritative film about one of the great
stories in rock and roll. The story is about Stax Records whose hits
include Sittin' On the Dock of the Bay, Soul Man, If Loving You Is
Wrong [I Don't Wanna Be Right], Knock On Wood and Respect.

A white brother and sister establish a recording studio in a black
Memphis neighbourhood in the 1960s and their open-door policy
created an interracial house band - Booker T. and the MGs - who
made hits for whomever came through those doors.

Those Stax stars included Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, The Dramatics
Albert King, Luther Ingram, Rufus Thomas and Jesse Jackson. The
legacy has never been stronger and Stax songs have been recorded
by scores of artists-- Aretha Franklin, Neil Young, Wu Tang Clan
Michael Bolton and almost every artist wanting to express their soul

Respect Yourself includes never before seen footage, including home
movies by the Stax artists, outtakes from WattStax, lost performances
by Otis Redding, Booker T. and the MGs, Isaac Hayes and others.

Interviews include all the key players plus Jesse Jackson,
Elvis Costello, Bono, Chuck D, Peter Townsend, Dan Aykroyd,
Justin Timberlake.
