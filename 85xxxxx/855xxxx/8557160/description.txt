  Danish electronic quartet Bliss create ambient soundscapes riddled with cinematic textures and downbeat bravado. Often compared to artists like Massive Attack and Sade, the group was the brainchild of writer/producers Marc-George Anderson and Steffen Aaskoven. Vocalists Tchando and Alexandra Hamnede provide Bliss with soulful performances that reflect their alternately African-tinged and jazz-based foundations, resulting in an ethereal stew of pan-global atmosphere. The group has been a European fixture for years, debuting in North America in 2005 with Quiet Letters, a 12-track collection culled from both the first and second editions of the European release.
