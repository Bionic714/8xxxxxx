Maybe the strangest upload you ever encountered. A list of albums (and one or two of their best songs) just to tell me why I should avoid playing this album (and not investigate it again). Looking at the scoring list quite popular..... Enjoy or become somewhat wiser. Do not be afraid its usually just bad sound quality.
