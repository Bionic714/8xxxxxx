A webcomic i found around 2008-2009 almost 600 pages so far and still counting, i think she releases around 2 per week so far so if you want to catch up you better start reading, i promise its worth it! i ripped these from the site for myself because i wanted to have them available even when on the go or without internet,
the website is 
http://www.sdamned.com/
and the archive (where you can see all uploads to date) is 
http://www.sdamned.com/archives/

i will try to post some screens but almost every page contains a spoiler
