,saintsmon,2013-06-09T22:36Z,With your suggestions it slows my ripping speed to 1.2x. its going to take 56 minutes to do one cd.
,saintsmon,2013-06-09T22:38Z,Accurip is not present in every track because i find speeling mistakes and i change it thus accurrip does not recognize this track
,Laserman59,2013-06-10T00:47Z,Any audiophile prefers quality over quantity. Rip however you want. I was just trying to help you out. Maybe the reason for your slow rip was a scratched CD. Anyway those settings would not be acceptable at some private trackers. I won't comment anymore on your quality.

Cheers"
