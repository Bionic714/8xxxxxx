This is a fanfiction. It is a story with a much darker theme than the original series, in which the world of pokemon is not what it used to be. Read the first chapter to find out more. Don't want to spoil it :)
New chapters will be uploaded every sunday here and on fanfiction:

I have also created a wiki for the story, but haven't added nothing yet.

Feel free to add things to the wiki and review on fanfiction. Your replies will motivate me to keep writing better every time!!
