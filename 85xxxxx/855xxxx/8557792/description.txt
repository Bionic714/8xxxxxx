Plot

****


Now inside the tower, Rachel tries to convince her former colleagues Dan and Grace to turn on the power. They adamantly refuse leaving it up to her, Nora, Charlie and Aaron to act on their own. Miles and Monroes also face off in the tower but old friendships seemingly die hard. Outside the tower, Neville has taken command of Monroe's troops and wants to solidify his position by ensuring the power stays off. Aaron, Nora, Rachel and Charlie - now joined by Miles - make it to the 12th floor but one of them will not survive.
