!BE SURE TO READ THE 'READ THIS' FILE PRESENT IN THIS TORRENT!

This is a large compilation of mainly first person shooters with some other first person genres included for Windows(and Macintosh for a few games). 

I tried not to get too carried away with RPG games, as this torrent was originally for only FPS games. 

This torrent does not include maze-walkers, light gun shooters/on the rails shooters, or full realtime three dimensional shooters like Quake and beyond. No disrespect for the games, but that just is not what this torrent is for.


I really did try to obtain only full versions, but sadly this was an impossibility. A few of the games are demos/betas. 

I attempted to group the games by 'waves' to sort of briefly describe what the gameplay would be like. First Wave would be the most basic, while Third Wave would be the most complex. 

The games had to be archived because it had too many files. You will need an archiving program to unzip the files, I recommend 7zip (http://www.7-zip.org/). 

I know you probably have half of these games already, but please, download the whole thing and seed if possible. I do recommend copying and pasting the files into a separate directory, as to not disturb the seeding process. 

Do not post comments asking to seed, be patient. 

This torrent has been full AND boot scanned by Avast!, with no malicious files detected. Please do scan the files with your preferred scanner, and post the results(IF THERE IS A MALICIOUS FILE).

I would also appreciate it, if you were to post the title of a shooter you feel should be added to the torrent that was not present. I most likely missed a few, and will eventually(as in, not immediately) update the compilation through separate torrents.
