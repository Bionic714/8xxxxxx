Just wondering if you're going to ul the following:

Escape of the Living Dead and Plague of the Living Dead?

Both Avatar titles, I believe.  "

Absolutely! I'm just trying to spread things out a little bit so it's not just ""Living Dead"" back to back all of the time. I also plan on uploading ""Night of the Living Dead - Aftermath"". It will be bundled with night of the living dead One Shots also! and no problem!"
