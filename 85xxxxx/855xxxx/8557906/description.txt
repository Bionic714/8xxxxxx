"Galtar and the Golden Lance" (1985)

A first season component of the Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera, Galtar and the Golden Lance was an outer space sword and sorcery affair featuring a light-hearted blonde warrior named Galtar. Searching for the vile Tormack, the despot responsible for the deaths of his parents, Galtar aligned himself with beautiful princess Goleeta and her feisty younger telekinetic brother Zorn. Goleeta and Zorn also had a score to settle with Tormack, who'd stolen Goleeta's magical golden shield. Tormack in turn coveted Galtar's equally magical double-edged golden lance, for whosoever possessed both lance and shield would be all-powerful. And both hero and villain had to deal as best they could with a brace of comic relief dwarves: Rak and Tuk, bumbling father-and-son mercenaries who excused their chronic double-crossing as "the only work we know". Written by Matt Karpowich.
