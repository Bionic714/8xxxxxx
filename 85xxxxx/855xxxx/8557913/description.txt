Legends of giant, flying, fire-breathing dragons have graced the pop culture landscape for centuries, from medieval manuscripts to the much-anticipated Peter Jackson film "The Hobbit." These harbingers of disaster were rumoured to guard treasure while wreaking havoc upon the land, and stories of the legendary heroes who rose to fight them have been depicted in countless books, films and even video games. But what if these mythical creatures were more than just a myth?
The one-hour special, Dragon Wars: Fire and Fury, , transports viewers to a fantasy world to understand the truth behind these fabled beasts with a unique approach to documentary storytelling Through a mix of live action sequences and cutting-edge CGI, famous dragon tales are brought roaring to life in the modern world, including the legend of Beowulf, the Scandinavian warrior king, and Fafnir, the vengeful dragon that inspired Tolkien's "The Hobbit." Experts weigh in on the credibility of these and other fables, providing additional historical context. Guided by art historian Dr. Janina Ramirez, we'll examine the roots of the dragon's origin and see how its image has been used for thousands of years.
