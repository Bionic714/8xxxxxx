Legendary 1971 concert film remastered from the original 35mm
negative in which a brilliant mix of predominantly Afro-American
soul artists take their music to West Africa to take part in a
14-hour extravaganza celebrating the 14th anniversary of Ghana's
independence from British rule in front of over 100,000 locals
in Black Star Square, Accra. Incendiary performances from Ike and
Tina Turner, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, jazz greats
Les McCann and Eddie Harris, Santana and Voices of East Harlem
see black America celebrating its cultural roots,
Afrocentric-style. The soul of America in the heart of Africa.
