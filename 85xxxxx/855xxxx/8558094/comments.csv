just the files are generated wrong, so game wont start

SOLUTION:
use the ""F 11 regenerator 1.6"" (included) or get V1.4.1 (fix)
select ""take care of edited files..."" > GO (can take some time)

more help: see info-file"
,kismetal,2013-06-15T14:32Z,"Hello! I have a problem with all your previous pathches: in Manager mode the first season goes just fine, but at the beginning of the second season after a few matches the game crashes, while it shows the transfer list (so it's not the original crash before the man of the match screen). I have 1.3.8 now, does this patch make any difference? Or is there a solution for it? Thanks!"

but i cant garantee anything
