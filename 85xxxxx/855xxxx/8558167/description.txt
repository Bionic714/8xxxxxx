The HitMan (Banned HandBook)

This is just what the title says...
the book "HITMAN" that caused a great controversy between '93 & '99 because a man said he used this guide to contract killing to murder someone. Paladin Press,the original publishers of this were sued and settled out of court - destroyed the remaining copies, and relinquished all rights to the book...
It was reprinted on Overthrow.com and this is the e-book form of that reprint.
