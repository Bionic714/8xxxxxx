,asdf42t,2013-06-10T17:38Z,"@eboneezer, dude ... did you read the title?....it CLEARLY states [unreleased], anyway, why doesn't it work? It uses community designed cars, so if you block the internet it will fail, so turn it on (it does not use any protection anyway) you will also need Net FrameWork 3.5 I think."
,asdf42t,2013-06-12T08:49Z,"UPDATE: The servers were modified, so you will get an outdated warning using this torrent, however the only thing you need to do is to patch to newest version. 

I upload the files already at: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8565960/NxGTR_Arcade_Car_Racing_3D_Patch_06-11"
