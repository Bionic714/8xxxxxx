,sunsprite,2013-06-10T04:27Z,Tku how do u instal multiple .zip files as I do not want language pack  sorry I'm not sufficiently computer literate
,Tstart,2013-06-10T09:19Z,"sunsprite: first unpack all the zips and then unrar, scene standard warez release.

maxmoser53: nope"
,sunsprite,2013-06-11T04:20Z,Tstart tks for response I'm puzzled by need for both a setup.exe and the run exe (GetFLV.exe) at this stage of install   I'll research further    bye
,Tstart,2013-06-11T09:51Z,first you install as usual and then copy the GetFLV.exe to the installed folder and overwrite the exisiting GetFLV.exe .. so it´s cracked and registered 
,sunsprite,2013-06-12T07:48Z,"Tstart, now that makes sense   much appreciate   ur time  with me "
,Tstart,2013-06-12T08:39Z,you´re welcome :) no problem at all :)
