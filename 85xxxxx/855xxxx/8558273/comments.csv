I found this show by accident too.  I was just desperate for new anime to watch other than Shingeki no kyojin.  The spring season seemed pretty weak, but 2 is better than none.  This show has it's slow moments for sure and it has a little bit of a bubblegum feel/look to it, but the story is unfolding nicely.  Too bad the season is almost over."
