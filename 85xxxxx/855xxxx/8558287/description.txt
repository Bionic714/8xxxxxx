Storyline: Mystery crime drama starring Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike. Adapted from a novel in Lee Child's best-selling crime series, the film sees Cruise in the title role as an ex-military policeman turned vigilante drifter who is called in to investigate after an expert sniper takes the lives of five random victims. When the authorities pull in former army sniper, James Barr (Joseph Sikora), they are certain they have the perpetrator, but Barr believes he's been set up and asks that Jack Reacher (Cruise) be assigned to the case. At first, Reacher is weary of Barr but after some thorough investigation he is led to believe there is an unseen force pulling the strings of the investigation and he's determined to get to the truth.
