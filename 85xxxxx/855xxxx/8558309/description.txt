Coast Series 8 
Coast, continues to explore the edge of our lives, the coastline that marries us to the sea. Through a history of assault from Nazi Germany, freshwater voles and the infamous Guernsey Privateers; the workers' coast of shipbuilders, fishermen and seaside entertainers; the joys of sunbathing and the history of Thomas Cook; the magnificent estuaries of the Firth of Forth, the Severn and the Thames; this is the history of Britain as told from cliff to sea. Nick Crane is joined by a team of expert presenters including Neil Oliver, Miranda Krestovnikoff, Mark Horton, Tessa Dunlop, Andy Torbet, Ian McMillan, Ruth Goodman, Nick Hewitt and newcomers Sarah Beynon and Cassie Newland as they explore the riches to be found along our Coast.




5)  The Secret Life of Sea Cliffs 
Nick Crane explores some of the most spectacular and scary sea cliffs in Britain. He embarks on an elevated journey to take in the high spots of the Yorkshire coastline. Nick is granted unique access to join secretive sea fishermen who have constructed a remarkable ropeway to make the perilous descent to fishing grounds at the foot of sheer sea cliffs. Why do these plucky Yorkshiremen go to such lengths to seek out this remote shoreline haven for anglers? Nick also explores the ingenious water-powered mechanism that operates the Victorian cliff lift at Saltburn-by-the-Sea. How did this innovative railway, running down sheer slopes to the sands, save the newly-founded resort from ruin? On the magnificent sea cliffs that surround Ramsey Island, biologist Sarah Beynon hunts for the superheroes of the insect world who do the island's dirty work, the dung beetles. Sarah knows these fascinating and beautiful creatures are critical to the success of the island's most famous wildlife residents, the choughs. These rare birds feed off the surprisingly numerous dung beetles. Sarah's researching why the beetles thrive on Ramsey's cliffs and how they help create a precious eco-system that is highly unusual in Britain.
