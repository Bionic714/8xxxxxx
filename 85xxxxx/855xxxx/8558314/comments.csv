,NiceLittleRabbit,2013-06-15T19:42Z,"Hello,

I may be stupid or something, but I still do not get how I should copy the data from Documents/data/Enroute/db_a and db_b in the 2.0.0 structure into JeppFD.app/DemoData/Enroute/Database in the 2.0.7 structure

If I copy the content into the Database folder, because both contents (both folders in db_a and in db_b are named db1 and store) have the same names, the second one I will copy will overwrite the first one.

Could someone explain me what I have missed?

Thank you to all who help, and specially to afil-fr this time."

,precursor1188,2013-06-16T17:41Z,"@NiceLittleRabbit
Since the data are demo, Jepp will not provide for old and new cycle i.e. it will not automatically cut over on effective date to the new data so only one db is catered. So you will load new data only on or after effective date. You can load from db_a or db_b on effective date and check which one is the newer one. That is my guess."
