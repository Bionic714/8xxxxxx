I saw him live in Kent, OH, it was really hilarious when he got super pissed at his sound crew at the beginning because they kept the voice echo effect on the mic when he wanted it off. He seemed kind of pissed the rest of the show, but it didn't change how cool the lights and the music were! He played a lot of his newer stuff from this album, and I loved it. So uh, enjoy and seed!
