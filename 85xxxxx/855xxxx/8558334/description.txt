Plot:

Justine is a nubile young virgin cast out of a French orphanage and thrust into a depraved world of prostitution, predatory lesbians, a fugitive murderess, bondage, branding, and one supremely sadistic monk. It's a twisted tale of strange desires, perverse pleasures and the ultimate corruption of innocence as told by the Marquis de Sade.

Highly controversial movie based off the Marquis de Sade's "Justine." Apologies for the lack of subtitles. I wasn't able to locate English subs for this source. Feel free to post subtitle links in the comments section if you find them.
