Needing an escape from her past, Avery chooses a college where no one knows her. Keeping a low profile was the plan, falling for the intense frat boy, Jase wasnΓÇÖt. Yet she canΓÇÖt deny how alive she feels when heΓÇÖs near. Even as common sense implores her to stay away, her body begs her to get closer.

Jase, numb from his own family drama, has grown bored with weekends fueled by nameless girls and countless bottles when he meets Avery. Helping her cope with her past is better than dealing with the bullshit his own lifeΓÇÖs served up. Determined to drive away the painful secret sheΓÇÖs guarding, he appoints himself her life coach, and challenges her to new experiences. Getting close to her and being the one to make her smile are simply perks of the job. 

But when AveryΓÇÖs past boldly saunters in, refusing to be forgotten, can Jase live with the truth about the girl heΓÇÖs fallen for?
