The story of Venetica takes place in a 16th century styled world where Death is a physical being, who follows the instructions of a group known as Corpus. 
Every generation, Corpus must select the successor for Death. 
The game takes place after the council chooses a necromancer to control death and he decides to bring complete death and destruction upon the world. 
This necromancer has immortalized himself through death, thus the current Death and Corpus cannot stop him. 
The only person capable of stopping him is Scarlett, the Protagonist, who is the daughter of Death, who must cultivate and grow her powers to save her father and the world from the necromancer.
