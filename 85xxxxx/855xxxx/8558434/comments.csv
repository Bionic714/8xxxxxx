Please stop doubling the framerate!"
,7tea,2013-06-10T18:05Z,"Either the origanly recording is damaged or the converting creates this problem. Fact is there is a lot of stutters throughout. If your original recording has only 25 or 30 fps, doubling it doesn't give you the desirable effect when the camera makes fast pans. 

You literally only double the same exact frame!!

Pleas stop that."

Everything is ok with framerate, it's real 60fps."
