,7tea,2013-06-10T17:53Z,"Thx, but please stop doubling the framerate. It only creates jerkyness. Does no-one see this? Ever since the second round, it is happening.

PLEASE STOP THAT"
,SC162,2013-06-10T20:58Z,"I had been finding the 29fps races to be nowhere near as good to watch as the 60 fps races. Had been really hoping the CBM races would get to 60fps, and now they have, so thanks. Keep up the good work :)"
