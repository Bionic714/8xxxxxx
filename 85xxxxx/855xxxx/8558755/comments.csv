,Daruca,2013-06-10T04:45Z,"Ok I have some modified directions that are different than what you see above to get this game working!

1.Unpack this release

4.Move said folder into your user ""download"" folder. 
5.Copy all the files in ""SimCity DRMLESS Beta Update 1.2"" and paste them into the main ""SimCity"" folder. Overwrite the files.
6.Go into the ""extra"" folder and install the ""Electronic Arts, Inc CA"" certificate. Make sure you put it into the ""Trusted Root Certification Authorities"" Store."

11.Click on ""Start"" in your ""SimCity"" Folder and run the server. "

-Update graphic card drivers
-Update sound card/chip drivers
-Update/Install DirectX
-Update/Install Visual C++ (VCRedist)
-Update OS

For certificate errors, during the installation guide check 'Place all certificates in the following store' and then pick 'Trusted Root Certification Authorities'. If it still doesn't work then I have no idea. D:

,odaic,2013-06-10T20:38Z,"I confirm it works fine.

At the beginning I was a bit confused with the server thing, so here I post a noobs guide with the 10 steps to follow. Doing so, you can anticipate and modify installation and language settings:

First of all

1. Install the game certificate from Extras => Double click over *.crt
Click Install => Select destination manually => Select Trusted Root Certification Authority

2. Add to your hosts file the commands provided in the hosts file inside Extras
Your hosts file is located in => c:Windowssystem32driversetshosts
Note: If you never touched this file before, to edit it you need to use notepad, uncheck read-only and change security options to be the owner (properties/security)
If you cant save changes, just save the file elsewhere and later overwrite the original one. Its easy to find more info about all that in google ""edit hosts file""

3. Copy everything from the ""DRMLESS Beta Update"" folder over the root/main folder of this download to apply the server update (its just a copy paste thing). Delete the stunnel folder because apparently is no longer required. Overwrite all the other files.

Game will be downloaded and installed through Origin. Next step is to prepare a fake server for origin and a folder for the game (if you dont want the default one).

3. If you have a folder/drive for your games, create inside something like ""OriginGamesSimCity#Server""
""SimCity"" part is mandatory provide that Origin creates exactly this folder for the game
No spaces are allowed in folder names

4. Inside #server folder copy everything from this torrent/download (Except origin installer, hosts file, and the update folder that you can already delete)

5. Then run Start.exe from #server to launch the fake Origin server. You should receive a ""everything sounds good"" message.
Note: Later, when you stop playing simcity, use Stop.exe to stop it


Time to start origin and download/install the game

6. Install Origin (the one provided v9.1.15.109 works just fine)

7. Launch Origin.exe
Type random username and password (provide server connection is cracked)
Note: Keep in mind that your Username will be later used as your major name.
Click Origin => Application Settings => Set language (english or whatever you want) and select the previously created destination folder
""OriginGames""

8. Go to MyGames tab inside origin. If certificate was properlly installed, SimCity should be available. Download and let origin install it
(It will be installed in OriginGames, or otherwise by default in C:Program files (x86)Origin Games etc...)

9. Launch the game through simcity.exe or through origin games tab and let it update its files

10. Restart and Play"

,SuperJ87,2013-06-11T01:17Z,"@James832

Just remove the lines that you added to your host file. Thats why I keep two version of my host file. If you need to create a host file again, this is the original one from windows:

# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# For example:
#
#      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server
#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost

just create that out of a notepad and save it with no extention or filetype. When you want to legitly use origin, replace this file with the cracked one for Sim City."
,SuperJ87,2013-06-11T01:21Z,"Also would like to say to @rocksbury that you are afraid because you are computer illiterate. Editing the hosts file cannot do anything harmful to your computer. You can always delete it and windows will create a new one. Please read up on whats vital vs. whats not in your windows installation.

Also want to say that I played through the tutorial 100% without any hitches, crashes, disconnects or anything else, and that my game was saved properly. Doing the initial steps may take some time to get right, but when you do, its no limits fun.  Been waiting to play this game forever, I'm glad I finally get the chance to.

This torrent works completely fine! 
Here's the clue for guys who have the following error when starting DRMLESS server, it says:
""-Dummy certificate does not seem to be installed
-Not able to reach the private server, Origin will not be able to login in to.
-Not able to reach the private server, SimCity will not be able to login in to.""

All you need to do is uncheck the read-only option of the #Server folder. Incase Windows does not approve that, here's how:
1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).
2. Locate the following registry key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrent VersionExplorer
3. On the Edit menu, point to New, click DWORD Value, and then type the following registry value name:
UseSystemForSystemFolders
4. Right-click the new value, and then click Modify.
5. Type 1, and then click OK.
6. Quit Registry Editor.
7. Open command console, type in: attrib -r , then hit enter

Now the folder is unset read-only, you can login DRMLESS server now.
Hope this help, cause it worked for me"

I know that bums some of you out, but if you are still using 32 bit PC's then you most likely are a broke fucktard and need to get your mom to go get you a better PC.. That being said here we go. First DISABLE ANTIVIRUS!!! they will just get in the way trust me! Ok now you make a SIMCITY folder on your desktop and then copy all the downloaded files into it.... Then place that folder into your user download folder on your C: drive... Ok now open the update folder inside the user download folder you just made. Paste all contents from it into the main user download folder. Ok now heres where it is kinda sticky. You need to go to kick ass torents and find the 1.2 to 1.3 update and download it. Its real easy to find. I even googled it and it was like the first choice. Now after you download it unzip the file and get the contents and paste the in the same spot you just placed the 1.2 update that came with the original crack from the Pirate Bay.. Ok now that you have the updating done and the folders set, take a breather and pull your nuts out of your sweaty butt cheeks. Ok next go to the extra folder and do this in this order.. find the Start icon in main folder of the user download folder. It should be right next to a stop icon.... Ok you need to right click on it and send it to your desktop! NOT copy and Paste or Move! Send To! after that, open it up and leave it for a min and dont try activating or starting the server... Next find the Certificate in the extra folder and click on it. install the certificate by choosing manuelly finding the path and choosing trusted root. It should be like the second choice..then hit ok. Now go to the server that you have opened and hit start server and it should say everything is ok.. If it says certificate was not installed just install it again and start it again.. Trust me it will work! Next install the Origin he gives you in the extra folder. You MUST install this origin and have no other origin on your computer. Trust me I tried with the same legal version of origin and it didnt work. ALSO if you need origin for any other game, then I advise you to stop what your doing cause this hacked Origin will not let you join a legit account.. After his Origin installs make your username and password anything you want it to be, but make it somthing you remember. Once you do that, log in and go to the my games tab and install the game anywhere you want. And you do that by going to the application settings and changing the path, but if you dont care where its insatlled just dont bother and hit download on the SimCity box. Wait for it to be done and try play it. Its not gonna work but still try to play it. Now go over to your server you have opened and hit the activate tab. It will say activation complete or somthing along those lines.. Now go back and try to play again..it will do an update and a restart but after that.... Guess what buddy you did it and you can play SimCity! IN your motherfucking face EA GAMES!     Sorry for such a long post but I swear on my wifes life this works 100%! Just follow step by step of what I just wrote and it will work. You dont need to delete the stunnel and stop things... you dont need to set shit read only..... just do it this way.. I am running Windows 8 Pro 64 bit with norton 360 and it installed and plays beautifly! Thank you for this Daruca! This deserves a Skull all by its self!"

,00crack,2013-06-11T22:55Z,"THIS WORKS ON Win7 x64!!! Initially had some problem but it finally worked!

DETAILED BUT SIMPLE STEPS I DID:

1. Copy all the files downloaded in the torrent to a folder named ""Simcity"". This is the folder discussed below and other files/folders are assumed to be under this ""Simcity"" folder.

2. In Windows Explorer, right-click the folder ""Simcity"" and uncheck Read-only. Once unchecked click OK. If it prompts for subfolders and files, select it and click OK.

3. Copy all cracked files found in the folder ""Simcity DRMLESS Beta Update"" and paste in the ""Simcity"" folder so as to replace a few files and merge a folder.

4. Go to ""Extras"" folder. Double click ""Electronic Arts, Inc CA.crt"" file. This will come up with a dialog. Click ""Install Certificate"". A Wizard dialog comes up, click next for first step. Choose ""Place certificates in the following store"" and click Browse. Select ""Trusted Root Certification Authorities"" and click OK. Back to the previous dialog, go on clicking Next and finish. A confirmation message should appear ""Import successful"".

5. Open Notepad as administrator. Open the file ""C:WindowsSystem32Driversetchosts"". Move the cursor to a new line at the end.

6. Open another Notepad (run as administrator not required) and open the hosts file located in ""SimcityExtras"" folder. Copy all the contents and paste them in the other Notepad opened earlier in point 5. With the contents added to the Windows host file, save the file opened in point 5. Close both Notepad windows.

7. Go to ""Simcity"" folder and double-click ""Start.exe"". A window should appear. On the top-left, click ""Start Server"". If any Windows Firewall prompts appear, click Allow. Message should be displayed as ""Everything is good"".

7.a. If message appears as ""Dummy certificate is not installed"", go to point 4 and install the certificate again properly.

7.b. If message appears as ""Private server cannot be started"" or something like that, go to point 2 and uncheck Read-only.

If either 7.a. or 7.b. then click on ""Stop Server"" and then ""Start Server"". If you've done everything correct till now, you should see ""Everything is good""

8. Go to ""Extras"" folder and install Origin by running the OriginSetup_xxx.exe file. Uncheck all options about running it at startup, share hardware etc...

9. Once installed, it will ask for Username and Password. Put anything, it doesn't matter. A bigger window will appear.

10. Under ""My Games"" click Simcity icon and click ""Download"". It will download from our already downloaded files and install.

11. Once its done, again click Simcity icon and click ""Play"". It will run an auto-update. THIS WILL TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES. Once done, it will show a restart button. Restart the game.

12. If error message appears ""Could not login to game server"", then click ""Retry"". For me it appeared once and I clicked ""Retry"" once and the game started.

13. How to exit and instructions on how to start playing subsequently have already been provided by others.

I hope it helps... Thanks for the torrent, waited so long for this game and working crack."

,NekoMaster,2013-06-12T13:32Z,"Well well, what do we have here? A working crack for Simcity 2013 :D

Downloaded this crack this morning and not only did it download pretty fast on my 15mbps connection (try 20 minutes) but I was actually able to get into the game, get through the tutorial, and even make a region and save it.

MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW 00crack's INSTRUCTIONS PRECISELY (ON PAGE 4) TO GET THIS TO WORK.

I only had to install this once to get it to work thanks to 00crack.

Both Vulpeszedra and 00crack deserve kudo's for getting this cracked game working

Now I'm off to find some mods for this game :)"

I got origin running and detecting simcity. There is still an error in the server ""-Dummy certificate does not seem to be installed"" but origin works.

Otherwise, be carefull, once you've installed the dummy certificates and the host file you can't use legit games from Origin until you removed them."
