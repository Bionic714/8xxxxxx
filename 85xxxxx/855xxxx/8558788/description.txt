Three books by novelist and essayist Cynthia Ozick:


Cynthia Ozick - Foreign Bodies (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010).

ISBN: 9780547577494 | 272 pages | EPUB

In her sixth novel, Cynthia Ozick retells the story of Henry JamesΓÇÖs The Ambassadors as a photographic negative, retaining the plot but reversing the meaning. At the core of the story is Bea Nightingale, a fiftyish divorced schoolteacher whose life has been on hold during the many years since her brief marriage. When her estranged, difficult brother asks her to leave New York for Paris to retrieve a nephew she barely knows, she becomes entangled in the lives of her brotherΓÇÖs family and even, after so long, her ex-husband. Every one of them is irrevocably changed by the events of just a few months in that fateful year. Traveling from New York to Paris to Hollywood, aiding and abetting her nephew and niece while waging a war of letters with her brother, facing her ex-husband and finally shaking off his lingering sneers from decades past, Bea Nightingale is a newly liberated divorcee who inadvertently wreaks havoc on the very people she tries to help.

Cynthia Ozick - Quarrel & Quandary: Essays (Knopf, 2000).

ISBN: 9780375410611 | 272 pages | EPUB

In nineteen opulent essays, Cynthia Ozick probes Dostoevsky for insights into the Unabomber, questions the role of the public intellectual, and dares to wonder what poetry is. She roams effortlessly from Kafka to James, Styron to Stein, and, in the book's most famous essay, dissects the gaudy commercialism that has reduced Anne Frank to "usable goods." Courageous, audacious, and sublime, these essays have the courage of conviction, the probing of genius, and the durable audacity to matter.
