This torrent consists of both the virtual machine environment as well as the related reading materials/coursework. It is compressed with RAR to save roughly 3.7GB, hopefully this will decrease download times that often plagues lesser seeded torrents. I will continue to seed this torrent many times over, please do not download unless you are capable and willing to reach a minimum of 1:0.5 ratio.
