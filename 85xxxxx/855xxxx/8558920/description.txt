found the dvd finally, didnt have the highest bitrate, was interlaced and
a little bit dark, but fixable. wasnt easy to make a perfect version, tried
7 videos before this one. with the interlace and brightening up there wasnt
much space for sharpness, some daylight scenes couldnt take the brightening
but i found a nice way through it. removed interlace, added a lot of
brightness to standard levels and added sharpness and denoise.
got very nice
enjoy
