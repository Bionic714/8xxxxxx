Do yourself a favor, go to youtube and watch a 480p clip and then watch it in 720 or 1080 and this is what you've been cheating yourself of all this time.

,KngAlaric,2013-06-10T06:39Z,"HD = unnecessarily large filesize. You'll have a hell of a time downloading as well, given the severely lopsided leech/seed ratio lately.

This is V10/A10 in my book. Crystal clear, spot-on sync and perfectly watchable. Are you a fucking epileptic or something that this HD/3D baloney is like a freaking requirement for you? 

If so fuck off then, because there are countless 720p/1080p versions floating around out there. Thank ettv for his time & consistent quality or GTFO.

Christ, freeloaders these days are all film connoisseurs."

,Mouseboy,2013-06-10T18:26Z,Go fuck yourself anyone who says SD version is bad. you idiots downloading the HD version probably dont even have a HD monitor or tv and are watching it on a 17 inch screen thinking youre the shit. youre just like idiots who buy macs and think they are better than pcs. i have a HD tv and monitor but i choose SD. Cos the difference in quality is hardly noticeable and its a waste of time downloading huge files with leechers. and this is coming from someone with 6TB of HDD space. HD is utterly pointless just like 3D. there is nothing wrong with SD at all. so go stfu you stupid trollish cunts.

Some people just prefer to save money. These days you don't really need Cable TV. You can get away with just a high speed internet connection and download or stream everything you want to watch. Why pay for a shit ton of extra channels and shows that you'll never watch.

Additionally some people in certain countries don't have the luxury of just going out and getting HBO. Some people have to choice but to download the things they want to watch."
