,topk,2013-06-10T05:07Z,"Downloaded in 6 minutes.
Morons whining ""seed"" - lrn2settings. Fucking set up the utorrent correctly and unless you have dialup you'll finish dling in under 10 minutes.
I cannot fucking stand the dumbfucks with their seed seed seed - it's seeding just fine you dumb fucking fuck"

Can you please explain more? The best settings that you used? Thanks"
,topk,2013-06-10T05:45Z,lamers
,topk,2013-06-10T05:47Z,"@mxb17 
just google utorrent best settings, how complex is that?"
,Primuz017,2013-06-10T05:47Z,"OMFG SO BAD EPISODE; AND IT WAS LAST ONE, NOTHING HAPPENS AS USUAL; OMFG FCUK EVERYTHING"
,topk,2013-06-10T05:50Z,"And another protip:

Always check the column Avail. - this shows you how many full copies have been downloaded so far and ready to share. If Avail. is less than 1.0 (aka  100%) than you'll never finish dling this until it'll become greater than 1.0 or tough luck.
The greater the Avail. the faster you should be able to finish dling."
,topk,2013-06-10T05:52Z,Right now the Avail. is 15+ so on this hugely popular torrent you should be able to finsih dling in under 10 minutes. Just set up your utoreent optimally (fucking GOOGLE it)
,topk,2013-06-10T05:52Z,show me replies
,mmd24,2013-06-10T05:53Z,"@topk

,topk,2013-06-10T05:54Z,The number of seeds is not as important as you think. It can be just 2 seeds and you'll still download a gig in under 5 minutes.
,mmd24,2013-06-10T05:54Z,"@topk i apologize, thx :)"
,topk,2013-06-10T05:56Z,"OK?

,cube10025,2013-06-10T06:09Z,"So what is the right settings? I seed at 3mbits on 100mbit line usually i get 2mbits down, this is still stock on 40kbs. So how are you able to download in 6 min?"

,ectoendomezo,2013-06-10T15:25Z,"Whelp! Thanks Dibya and PublicHD and whomever else..for this season of GOT.

Truly Appreciate it..'cause if I'd PAID for this it would be the proverbial ""straw"".

So..There it is then..another season of nothing happening and people walking and pointless ""plot""(I mean one more pointless scene with the 'little snow bunny rebel' saying 'c'mon john snow..you know you like it' or to that effect and its hari-kiri time) as the best pro-fascism propaganda ever devised continues into season 4...love/hate..kind of like 'fire/ice/ eh what?"

,Nightblade88,2013-06-10T21:30Z,"This is really slow. The strange thing is that there are quite a few seeders... just plain weird.
Anyway, cheers for the upload Dibya."
