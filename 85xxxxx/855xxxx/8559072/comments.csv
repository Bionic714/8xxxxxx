,tobywoo,2013-06-10T07:49Z,"topK...so what are the settings you're using?  People complaining about complainers, without actually doing anything other than acting like arrogant know-it-alls, are even MORE annoying. Throw a bone to those who may not have the knowledge you do. It IS called Peer to Peer after all.  EZTV, as always, thanks for the great work."
