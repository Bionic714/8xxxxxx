NFO ---&gt; There is what appears to be a video glitch at 6:37 however it is not a glitch but 15 seconds of dead air that was broadcast by ABC. I recorded the show from 2 sources and both have an ABC logo for 15 seconds an no Kimmel. When the video feed returns it appears that the video has jumped forward so I removed the dead air spot  and spliced it together. It is what it is. Enjoy. Also could it hurt for you guys to throw up some comments once in a while?! A Thank You goes a long way!
