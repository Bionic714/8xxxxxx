===================== NOTE =====================
.

If any of MY torrents get NO or only a few Comments

Then I take this as:

You never liked the series
You never liked the quality
You are ALL very ill-mannered

It does no matter which one of the above, but

I will not post any more in that series.
I will not re-seed any torrent that has no comments

I never reseed for downloaders I do not know
If you've never posted a comment on my torrents I do not know you
Do not ask for a re-seed you will be ignored
.
Once 5 people complete I stop seeding
.
[b]I do NOT expect comments on how great I am, I already know that
Comments on quality help YOU the downloaders[/b]

=================================================

Liz Bonnin joins a team of scientists studying endangered Siberian tigers in Russia's Far East. When three orphaned cubs are discovered, the team launch a desperate rescue mission.

The Siberian tiger is one of Earth's rarest and most elusive animals, with as few as 300 remaining. It is so rare, more scientists have been to space than have seen one in the wild. In this series, Liz Bonnin, a former tiger biologist herself, travels to the frozen forests of the Russian Far East to help a team of scientists studying these big cats. Their goal is to uncover the hidden world of this mysterious predator, determine why they are declining and what can be done to save them. 

When three orphaned cubs are discovered, the team launch a desperate rescue mission. Cameraman Max Hug Williams joins rangers in the race against time to find the cubs as a blizzard approaches - capturing remarkable footage in the process.
