,BumbleDouche,2013-06-14T04:23Z,"Where is ""An Ideal of Hope,"" the music from the 2nd trailer?  Is it part of another track?"
,kellogg9,2013-06-14T06:39Z,"@BumbleDouche:

""An Ideal of Hope"" wasn't the official score name you dumb ass.  Sheesh, some people shouldn't be allowed to sneak away their parents computers."

Well, there's no need to get all high and mighty about it!  I know the SCORE NAME, as you put it, isn't ""An Ideal of Hope,"" it's ""Man of Steel.""  

There WAS a TRACK named ""An Ideal of Hope"" on the pre-release and score previews on Amazon and other sites.  I incorrectly assumed that this title would make it to the final soundtrack 'as is,' which is why I asked what had happened to it.  

I knew it was there in some form, as Hans Zimmer himself had confirmed it.  I was hoping, clearly forlornly, that some helpful individual in the PB community might tell me into which track it had been incorporated.  I don't know what possessed me into thinking I might actually get an useful response!  

Clearly, it's a waste of time asking an ordinary question when people can't give a simple answer without being rude.  There was no need to resort to immature name-calling... You pathetic fuck face.  "

You can't find the music from the 2nd trailer because ""An Ideal of Hope"" isn't from the 2nd trailer.  The music from the 2nd trailer isn't even from Hans Zimmer, so hence, it's not here.

You are talking about the song that sounds like music from The Gladiator correct?"
,bsykes76,2013-06-15T03:40Z,"The music you're referring to is't called ""An Ideal of Hope"".  It isn't even by Hans Zimmer, so that's why it ain't on the Soundtrack."
,BumbleDouche,2013-06-15T06:29Z,"The music I'm referring to IS by Hans Zimmer and was, at some stage, called ""An Ideal of Hope.""  The title clearly didn't stick.  If it isn't on the 2nd trailer, it may possibly be the 3rd, I'm not sure which exactly.  The theme, which is quite distinct, is heard throughout several tracks, particularly ""What are you going to do?"" at around the 3:20 minute mark and variations in ""Flight.""  The track I was talking about, as heard in the trailer and named ""An Ideal of Hope"" is plastered all over YouTube, I can't believe nobody knows what I'm talking about.  "
