,XONi49,2013-06-10T10:58Z,is it just me or is the story line way out of whack?? season 2 ends with the drop pods and season 3 jumping like 6 months ahead with no story on who the aliens in the pods where and playing with new tech that just magically appeared 
[V],psspss,2013-06-10T12:13Z,"i suspect they have flash back(s) to the meet up ?

guess they wanted to dive in a fast paced action scene on the new episode


IS it just me or is the colours looking dimmed/washed out..

on purpose or coding?"
