,InternetBatman,2013-06-10T08:26Z,How is it possible to have so many leechers that are not seeding and i have 2% seeding at 100KB/s ??????
,kiwij,2013-06-10T08:53Z,"Warning, there is a ""REPACK"" version, probably best to get that version instead."
,Zapzi,2013-06-10T19:20Z,"There's no need to get the ""repack"". Evolve's notes: We weren't going to repack, but all knows what retaliation would happen
otherwise... previous contained 5s promo @ 42m15s between episodes. We
also added full credits to this version. Don't download this if you have
the original one, you aren't missing any of the show. "
