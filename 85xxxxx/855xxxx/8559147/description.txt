I know this is a pretty old book whose 1st edition was published in 1958. It belongs to my cousin & I used it extensively during my junior college days in the 80's. The syllabus has undergone many changes now but the topics are equally useful even today! You can use this book in conjuction with another one that I had scanned & uploaded a few months back called 'Teach Yourself Algebra'.
