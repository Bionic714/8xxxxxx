,ChingaTuu,2013-06-10T09:00Z,"...Bah. I had the misfortune of seeing Leno live back in '81. He wasn't funny then. He's not funny now. In fact, the only time he's been funny was when the kids on ""South Park"" skewered him about his chin.

I take that back. There was another time he was funny. The only problem was that people were confusing him for Paul Rodriguez, who *is* funny.

Effort appreciated, but if ever a scan needed to be burned...:P"
