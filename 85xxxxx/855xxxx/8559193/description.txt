This goofy little comic story was put out in three parts. It was originally spread out thru various titles as an insert. I simply compiled them into one file for ease of reading. I added a photo shopped cover to the file also just for fun. (hope that's ok) This is my very first attempt at uploading so I wanted to try to put out something a little different. As always, all credit goes to the original scanners, artists, writers and all others who grace us with these tales. And also a special thanks to all my Pirate heroes. ie blackcanary, STFmaryville, mothra67 just to name a few. I hope somebody enjoys this and I look forward to putting up some other off the wall projects.
