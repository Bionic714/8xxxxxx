But there is a 1.3 now.

This makes Simcity work by ""faking"" an Origin server locally.

It requires hosts editing and other things, but it does work. However, trading between regions doesn't work, and you can as I am writing this, only play in one region."
,Fluid56,2013-06-10T20:46Z,"I'm still skeptical. The last ""crack"" passing around for simcity had some shitty bitcoin miner/keylogger/wannabe-hijacking shit in it. took me 3 days to clear up the damage."
,Digimoon,2013-06-11T01:33Z,This crack is shit. Trust me I know. Only works on 64 bits systems...
,rbt1,2013-06-12T13:32Z,"this works, you just have to follow the instructions

true, there are some problems but most should be fixed later on

as for the 32bit problem, I might look into it, but cant see why this should not work"
