 Game Notes 
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 This is a new SimCity that delivers unprecedented depth of simulation, with 
 the new GlassBox engine where everything you see is simulated even down to 
 each individual Sim in your city. The model-like world and detail of the 
 simulation make this the most responsive and personal SimCity ever. This is 
 also the most expansive city management game yet where you can control a 
 region that delivers true multi-city scale and play a single city or up to 16
 cities at once each with different specializations. Multiplayer is also a 
 first for the series, which adds a new dimension to your game as your 
 decisions impact both your city and your region and creates new ways to play
 by collaborating or competing to earn achievements. Finally, SimCity is a live
 service that simulates real time updates from new challenges to new features 
 and content.
