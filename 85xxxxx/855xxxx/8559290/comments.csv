,dani0519,2013-06-11T02:54Z,THANK YOU For UPLOADING in AVI format... Some dinosaurs like myself find that this is the only format that I can get to play on my VLC player. FRUSTRATING for sure. Somewhat Newbit so I'm not sure if it's something I'd doing but I really appreciate being able to find it in AVI format.  Happy Canuck Eh?!
