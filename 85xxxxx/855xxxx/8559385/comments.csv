You need to concede to yourself that you are just as ineffectual and lame as everyone else and get on with your life as best you can."

I knew full well ahead of time I'd be up against a wall of opposition and rude comments from people such as yourself. Be it meant in the nicest way possible or just plain slandering, I know very well how to deal with people like you. WHITE SMOKE JIM"
