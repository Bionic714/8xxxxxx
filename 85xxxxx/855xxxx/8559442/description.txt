Important information (PLEASE READ BEFORE DOWNLOADING!)
My method of obtaining the answers in the first place was by "printing" the printer-friendly versions of these labs and saving them as PDFs. 
In some of these answer sheets I downloaded while having this up and running, the answers for some of them did not show (specifically ones asking you to rearrange numbers and/or ideas in a grid from greatest to least). I unfortunately no longer have access to these labs so I cannot retrieve images (failed to do this while my subscription was up and running XD). Some of the video preview images also decided to not show up here and there within the labs, although I believe the titles of the videos will be the same if not very similar to the videos possibly within the labs for your specific class. The PDFs in this torrent are all text-searchable.
Also, there's probably an EXCELLENT chance any numerical values found in the questions will differ from your own or otherwise not be absolutely identical; however, I am pretty sure the basic idea behind the questions remains the same even if numbers are mixed up or change for each assignment (some kind of rotation). 
The solutions for the specific Mastering Physics labs within this torrent are as follows: 
- Vectors and Inertia
- Kinematics
- Newton's Second Law
- Newton's Third Law, Vectors
- Momentum and Impulse
- Energy
- Rotational Motion
- Gravity
- Projectile Motion
- Projectile Motion and Orbital Motion
- Temperature, Heat, and Expansion
- Change of Phase, Sound
- Refraction and Interference
- Electricity
