,msbono,2013-06-10T09:55Z,"I don't know if it's come to everyone's attention but The Borgias has been cancelled and what should've been the Season Finale turned into a Series Finale. Well, there's lots more to tell and we're organizing protests to try and make Showtime reconsider and give us at least half a season to tie up loose ends.
You can find all the info on tumblr (tag: save the borgias) and on facebook there's a group ""Bring Back The Borgias"".
All help is hightly appreciated!"
,Lucian_,2013-06-11T00:46Z,Ah that's bad news. Makes me feel bad for torrenting it even. :(
,MsMuffet,2013-06-11T05:36Z,"msbono ... the series is very loosely based around the history of the Borgia family. Since the actual facts about the reign of Pope Alexander VI is almost at an end, likewise the series will finish. To make it more exciting they've taken a bit of poetic license with the story and padded it out as far as it can go, but they certainly can't fabricate an entire third series around the Borgias. "
