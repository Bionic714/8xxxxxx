,Gabzilla16,2013-06-11T14:09Z,"I'm not at all new to torrents, piratebay or the kardashians.
I just love me a good torrent and some trashy TV occasionally.
This, good sir, is both.
Many thanks"
,haoluo,2013-06-16T18:23Z,"why are you guys so annoying. Why can't you convert it into a more common format such as avi etc and can reduce the size of upload. Its just 40 mins got dammit, if encoded properly it should definitely not be 471 mb like this. Takes forever to download and then the video format is the one which requires a separate player."
,atndigcrk,2013-06-17T00:09Z,"avi ?? this  aint the 90s anymore.....
