I have already downloaded something from another site, but I was wondering if you would have been able to upload it.  It's the two World Superbike (WSBK) races from Portimao, Portugal on Sunday, June 9th.

The reason I ask is that I am a member of a file sharing website that is dedicated to racing only, but my small amount of bandwidth is causing my download/upload ratio to be heavily skewed toward the download side.  This site will eventually kick me off if I can't improve those numbers, so I'm trying to find all of the racing that I love via other sources to keep my downloading from that site to a minimum."
