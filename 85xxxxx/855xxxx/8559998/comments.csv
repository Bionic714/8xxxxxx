,msbono,2013-06-10T16:30Z,"I don't know if it's come to everyone's attention but The Borgias has been cancelled and what should've been the Season Finale turned into a Series Finale. Well, there's lots more to tell and we're organizing protests to try and make Showtime reconsider and give us at least half a season to tie up loose ends.
You can find all the info on tumblr (tag: save the borgias) and on facebook there's a group ""Bring Back The Borgias"".
All help is hightly appreciated!"
