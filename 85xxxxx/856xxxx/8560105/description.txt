In this very well made video tutorial by Todd Olthoff, he teaches you everything from the basics to advanced ways in starting your own Mac OS X Mountain Lion Server. This is a 44 part series. Each video is a HD 1280x720 MP4 file. This took me very long to download each individual file from YouTube then upload to uploaded, so please Thank me. This tutorial uses Mountain Lion Server v2.2.1.
