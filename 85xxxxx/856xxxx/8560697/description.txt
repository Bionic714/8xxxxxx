The Kinks in Mono [10-CD Box Set] (2011) [FLAC]


Compared to The Beatles in Mono or Bob Dylan: The Original Mono Recordings, the ten-disc box set The Kinks in Mono may not seem revelatory, partially because so much of it was released earlier in 2011 as part of UniversalΓÇÖs campaign of double-disc deluxe reissues of the bandΓÇÖs catalog. Apart from a newly remastered mono mix of The Village Green Preservation Society and six stray alternate mixes -- including significantly different mixes of ΓÇ£RatsΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£ApemanΓÇ¥ -- all of this appeared on the 2011 deluxe editions, thereby diminishing this set's appeal for the devoted who already snatched up the reissues. But for those diehards who, for whatever reason, opted out of the two-disc sets, this is a mightily attractive way to get all the mono mixes at once, considering that each of the seven albums, along with the bonus EP and Mono Kollectables discs, are packaged as mini-LPs and the set has a clever mini-hardcover book designed in the fashion of a ΓÇÿ60s fan mag with new notes by Kinks expert Peter Doggett.
