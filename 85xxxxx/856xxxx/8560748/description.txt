Kayla Sutton faces a question no mother wants to face: what would you do to save your daughter? Broke and desperate, she siphons thousands from the company she works for in order to pay for her daughterΓÇÖs experimental life-saving treatment. But when Gage Channing discovers her theft, she is shocked to learn that her domineering boss has no intention of turning her over to the police. Instead he issues an ultimatumΓÇösubmit to him, or go to jail.

Backed into a corner, Kayla signs his contract and spends her first weekend at his home, at his mercy, and is stunned when he awakens the desire sheΓÇÖd believed long dead.

Enslaved (The Devil's Kiss #2) by Gemma James (January 31st 2013)

Freedom is but an illusion . . . 

Kayla Sutton finds out the hard way that Gage ChanningΓÇÖs dominance doesnΓÇÖt end once she leaves the confines of his basement. His rules dictate her days and nights, his watchful eye keeps her in line at work, and the memories of her weekend with him, spent under his absolute control and his firm hand, keeps her on her toes. Having been blackmailed into submitting to him, Kayla doesnΓÇÖt fully understand what it means to relinquish control of her body and free will, and she doesnΓÇÖt understand how a man who derives pleasure in whipping and humiliating her is capable of awakening the desire she hadnΓÇÖt known existed. 

As her daughterΓÇÖs life hangs in the balance, Kayla must dig deep to find the strength to fully submit, to travel down the path of pain and pleasure. But when her past catches up to her, prompting a free fall into forbidden territory with a man she once fiercely loved, she knows her only recourse is to come clean about her transgression to her Master and beg his forgiveness . . . only she never imagined heΓÇÖd have such a horrifying punishment awaiting her, or that his jealousy would send her life into a further tailspin.

Retribution (The Devil's Kiss #3) by Gemma James (April 10th 2013)

Kayla Sutton thinks itΓÇÖs over. She now holds the leverage she believes will end her contract with her blackmailer, but Gage Channing isnΓÇÖt going down without a fight. HeΓÇÖs turned the tables on her, cleverly making her submit under the guise of giving her a choice, and Kayla soon discovers that retribution isnΓÇÖt so black and white when everyone around her has secrets.

She faced sexual servitude in Ultimatum. In Enslaved she was seduced into craving it. Now she must find the strength to either accept the part of her that craves him still, or walk away for good . . .
