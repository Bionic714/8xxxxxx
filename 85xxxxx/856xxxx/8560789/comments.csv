,Norilor,2013-06-10T18:12Z,I get a torrent error too.
,DrJOnes666,2013-06-10T18:32Z,"I get same error that ""conester gets (Element Not Found).  That being said, I searched for the same torrent on other site, and it the keygen contains more than 3 trojans.

If this torrent is legit, how about posting the serials directly in comments instead of having to use keygen?"
,watchingandjudging,2013-06-10T18:48Z,same here. Trojans

Here are some serials , but you have to put some stuff in your hosts file to prevent reporting to adobe

1160-4497-5643-8744-7913-5532
1160-4604-6224-1829-1555-1902
1160-4524-0535-1700-6536-7108
1160-4052-8974-3611-5174-1488
1160-4254-2403-2097-1029-9785

,borrowedwifi,2013-06-10T21:10Z,"Lightroom 5 is working perfectly!

Ran the keygen on a fireproof test box running off of a cd (no hard drive), and the program accepted the number and installed without a hitch.

Adobe had already been blocked for ""other reasons"" in my hosts file, but I turned off the internet prior to doing the install anyway. Internet is back up, and several start/stop/start cycles of the program reveal no glitches or other issues.

Looks like we're in business.

High praise to Drarbg!"
,erniehatt,2013-06-13T02:42Z,"the serials work fine.
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com. Add this line to hosts file."
