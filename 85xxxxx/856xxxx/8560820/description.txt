Aslan, a young Iranian emigrant, lucidly charts the growth of Islam from Muhammad's model community in MedinaΓÇödepicted as a center of egalitarian social reformΓÇöthrough the chaotic contest to define the faith after the Prophet's death. Within generations, seven hundred thousand hadithΓÇöaccounts of Muhammad's words and deedsΓÇöwere in circulation, many "fabricated by individuals who sought to legitimize their own particular beliefs." Out of this muddle was born the primacy of the ulema, Islam's clerical establishment. The ulema, in Aslan's view, foreclosed Koranic interpretation, detoured from the Medinan ideal, and obscured Islam under a thicket of legalistic decrees. Fifteen centuries after Muhammad, Islam has reached the age at which Christianity underwent its reformation; Islam's renewal, Aslan attests, "is already here." However, both modernizers and their "fundamentalist" opposites call themselves reformers, and the victory of the former is not assured.
