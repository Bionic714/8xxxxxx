STORYLiNE:
In Varanasi, Dharam Dhillon (Dharmendra) is conning people along with his son Gajodhar (Bobby Deol) by pretending to be Gurus. When Sir Yograj Khanna (Annu Kapoor) from England comes to meet Dharam thinking he is a Guru, DharamΓÇÖs eyes twinkle and settle on his diamond rings. Dharam & Gajodhar pretend to be the owners Oberoi of Oberoi & Oberoi Company, in order to fool Yograj. Yograj gets impressed, and mentions his daughter. Dharam tells Gajodhar to go make his daughter Suman Khanna (Neha Sharma) fall in love with him, which he does and soon marriage is fixed. However, Dharam's elder son Paramveer (Sunny Deol), a loan recovery agent for a bank, by chance meets Yograj Khanna.
Paramveer lands up at Khanna's club just as Joginder Armstrong (Anupam Kher) arrived to take over the club. Joginder is mostly called ΓÇ£DudeΓÇ¥ and has the hair and gall to reference one of cinemaΓÇÖs most curious and cherished characters (Jeff ΓÇ£The DudeΓÇ¥ from The Big Lebowski). Joginder brings his two main flunkies (played by Johnny Lever and Sucheta Khanna) along with a group of goons, who are then all bashed up by Paramveer. Yograj hugs him and makes him his manager. Then, Paramveer encounters Dharam and Gajodhar trying to become part of Yograj's wealth. Paramveer has the power to stop his father and brother, but will he? Or will he yet again become a part of their con?
