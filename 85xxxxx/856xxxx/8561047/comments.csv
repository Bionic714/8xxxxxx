Watch out ! This is only the cover, no stories of any kind...

I always use calibre to transform into pdf or txt and this one comes as only the cover, two pages and that's all and the text file comes EMPTY. Uploading a pdf would be the right thing to do for everyone to be able to read.

I'm using Calibre-0.9.4, and I see the whole thing.

It's all there, there is no problem with this file as it works just fine for me.

(I did do a Google search to get the actual .torrent file from limetor.com before downloading)

If you're having trouble you might try doing a forced re-check of the file in the torrent to make sure it's not monkeyfucked as sometimes happens and if it's incomplete continue the download and then re-installing it in Calibre.

NOTE that if you're clicking on the ""click to open"" link at the lower right you're just opening the file and you will only see the cover, the .mobi file and the .opf file.... click the title of the book to open it as a book.

.pdf is my preferred format too, but everything isn't available in .pdf and some things don't convert well."
