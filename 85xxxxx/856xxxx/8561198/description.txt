PLOT


The Yellowstone National Park is the oldest national park in the world. It is home to a landscape with the worldΓÇÖs 
highest concentration of geysers and thermal springs, as well as being famous for its herds of bison that roam the plateaus of 
the highlands.

The herds are often accompanied by wolves, which were reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park around ten years ago. 
Black bears, beavers and wapitis also inhabit the park, which the locals affectionately refer to as ΓÇ£The YellowstoneΓÇ¥.
A park justifiably recognised by UNESCO as a World Natural Heritage Site. After all, in addition to its impressive flora and fauna, 
the national park provides us with an insight into the history of the EarthΓÇÖs origins. It transports visitors back into a time when 
volcanoes and the forces of Mother Nature once shaped our world. These forces can be experienced when huge fountains of water shoot high into the sky and pure energy from the EarthΓÇÖs interior finds an outlet.

The World Natural Heritage Yellowstone National Park ΓÇô a film in which nature plays the leading role, thereby illustrating why it 
makes sense to both preserve and protect it
