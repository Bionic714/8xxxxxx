The only copy I could find of these on the net was really bad quality, obviously recorded off an old tape deck and impossible to listen to. 

Decided to try cleaning these up myself and after being passed through an adaptive noise reduction, 3 custom filters and a volume leveler I am finally happy with the result and decided to upload them for people who like these books, but are unhappy with the poor quality of the other copies.

Occasionally a little tinny but not much I can do based on what I had to work with, unfortunately removing the hiss removes the vocal tone on the same audio band so some tone was lost but as little as possible.

Sample included 30 secs of the originals and 30 seconds after being cleaned.

Enjoy!
