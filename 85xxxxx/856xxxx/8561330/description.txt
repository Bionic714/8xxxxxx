Founded 1994 in Central Illinois by guitarist Kevin Menssen, these perverted
musicians of death have developed into one of the most disturbing death grind commandos units known to mankind over the years ΓÇô not only in terms of sound but also visually. Their absolutely sick covers put even hardened eyes to a severe test.
Hailing from Illinois, along with other acts such as Lividity and the cannibals Impetigo, it seems that this region is full of bizarre people. The strange band name Waco Jesus has no meaning but refers to a massacre committed February 28th 1993 by the Federal Bureau Of Investigation to a group of religious fanatics in Waco. The first demo was released and distributed by the band in 1995. After a few line-up changes the band recruited Lividity- axeman Dave Kibler and drumchaote Nick Null. After a few shows in the U.S. Waco Jesus signed to United Guttural Records, where the bizarre debut ΓÇ₧The Destruction Of Commercial ScumΓÇ£ was released. Then Dave Kibler left to focus on Lividity and in 2002 Nick Null died. Both were replaced with Johnny Baker on drums and Chris Sweborg on Guitars.
Now with a solid lineup Waco Jesus continues their series of attacks on human ethics ΓÇô by the release of their second album ΓÇ£FilthΓÇ¥. Musically the guys from Illinois live up to their image: ΓÇ£FilthΓÇ¥, in parts an extremely fast manifest of disgust, offers severely brutal rhythms, manic psychotic growl/screech vocals and guitar work of morbid and abnormal styles.
