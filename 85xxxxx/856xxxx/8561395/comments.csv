I don't normally do requests, but I looked it up and it looks like something I'd be interested in, so I can definately upload it for you if I can find it!"
,DuckyNDS,2013-06-11T04:36Z,Awesome. I (and anyone else who ends up reading it will) definitely appreciate it! Thanks!

No problem! May be a week until it's up but I will definately be uploading it!"
