Supremes A' Go-Go was the group's first number one pop album, propelled to that place with help from a chart-topping single ("You Can't Hurry Love") and a marketing ploy that generated an irresistible song lineup. 

And along with The Supremes Sing Holland-Dozier-Holland, Supremes A' Go-Go has held its value better than almost any of the trio's most successful albums (which excludes We Remember Sam Cooke) -- in fact, back in the days when vinyl was the only game in town, used copies of this record sold faster and better than any of their other common '60s LPs, and for good reason. Various hits compilations had skimmed the most familiar songs off of Where Did Our Love Go, I Hear a Symphony, etc., but the very concept behind Supremes A' Go-Go getting the group to cover some of the top hits of other (mostly Motown) acts dictated that every song on this album was familiar in name, and only "You Can't Hurry Love" was culled for any hits packages.

The Supremes fue un grupo de música pop y soul estadounidense, formado exclusivamente por chicas, que interpretó canciones de distintos géneros musicales, desde el doo wop a la psicodelia y la música disco. Se formó en 1961 en la ciudad de Detroit. Sus primeras integrantes fueron:Diana Ross, Mary Wilson y Florence Ballard.
