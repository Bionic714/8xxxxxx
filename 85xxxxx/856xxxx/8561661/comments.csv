[T],Knaster,2013-06-10T22:51Z,Can you translate what you just wrote koss5507783 ?
,Marcosmgt,2013-06-10T22:51Z,"Yeah, my question is: what they gain from this?"
,topk,2013-06-10T23:30Z,@koss55... I second the question. What did you babble about?
,topk,2013-06-10T23:32Z,"@Koss55... Why should I care? It's from Mr. Stiffler, that means it's legit to my purposes... no?
Why should I not download it and enjoy playing for free?"
,WTFRUDoing,2013-06-11T01:58Z,"Thanks for the program.  Works fine on Win 8 64 bits. Not only is Mr.Stifmeister a well established member, but also has a green skull. Additionally, I have not had ANY problems with WALMART releases."
,Aoishiro,2013-06-11T04:33Z,"@ everybody. 

So 1st,

Differentiate between uploader and a scene group. No offense to stiiff or ez or all of other trusted uploader. BUT without scene group there will be NO PIRATED GAMES. So literally, the real person or group of person you should be thanking is the SCENE GROUP like SKIDROW, FLT, CPY, etc.

It really pisses me off when reading the comment section most of most these releases. NOBODY even mentioning the scene group whom doing all the hard work. Most of you just kept thanking and thanking the uploader. Yeah you should thank them, but ANYBODY could grab this on orlydb and upload them here.

For a release that doesn't available at orlydb, like steamworks, steamrip, p2p, or like recent borderlands krieg's release, THEN you should thank the uploader the most.

All i'm trying to say, you should try to differentiate who's doing the most work in making these pirated games available for public you know.

2nd,

Ahat koss meant was, This game is avaiable DRM free at gog. Just like orlydb, anybody could grab this at gog and uploaded here. So why as a SCENE group they go through the length to crack this?"
,Timbo6669,2013-06-11T04:38Z,koss550 is stupid..he's been trolling all of WALMART torents...he cant even write or spell....leave this site for the big boys Kos550.....
,Timbo6669,2013-06-11T04:41Z,"Aioshiro - hey dude, if the scene had their way, we wouldnt have any cracks coming through... the scene dont crack for the public...thats why they're rarely thanked.(ever notice the file - Extremezone AKA piratepedia is a peice of shit) most of the uploaders are enemies of the scene groups..get your facts straight before you comment.."
,Timbo6669,2013-06-11T04:43Z,"and orylb isnt a site to be trusted...if you were here a while you would know the skull uploaders rarely get torrents from those fake wannabe sites...like orylb,skidrow.com,etc...LEARN PPL!!!"
,leehwgoC,2013-06-11T05:55Z,"Timbo, none of that addresses the simple point that this game is available DRM free on GoG, so there's nothing for WaLMaRT to actually crack.  There's even a torrent of the GoG version of the game released here.

Oh, and your claim that scene groups don't crack for the public is pure nonsense.  It proves you really don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Even before there was bittorrent, the scene groups simply released on newsgroups and IRC, and everything was always publicly available."
,leehwgoC,2013-06-11T06:07Z,"Anyway, does anyone know if this release is already up to date with the fifth patch?  NFO seems to suggest that it is.

Back in 2011 when this PC port first came out, it was unplayable garbage on ATi/AMD.  It's the only reason I'm not simply buying this on GoG straight away.  I need to see if this is actually worth paying for now."
,CMS93,2013-06-11T07:24Z,"@Aoishiro

You forgot to mention the developers.. After all, they're the ones that made all the hard work. Making a game is not easy you know."
,Timbo6669,2013-06-11T12:27Z,Lol..leewhgo- dig deeper...the cracks are by the scene for the scene..for the majority...and this is the up to date version and all hd textures not in the gog version...fck tools..
,Timbo6669,2013-06-11T12:28Z,get fcked outta here and buy it you fckn  waste of thought...
,Gun_man,2013-06-11T12:52Z,Timbo6669 is fucking stupid and ignorant little man.Go fuck your self in the head until you die. 
,Gun_man,2013-06-11T12:54Z,Aoishiro whey da go :D :D
,revanhan,2013-06-11T17:21Z,WaLMaRT should mention the source of their file. ie mention the name of the cracker group which in this case they can simply write GOG in their nfo. They tends to mislead people. Same things with that Skyrim Legendary Edition by WaLMaRT. They repack skyrim themselves and use old crack from other groups but claim it to be cracked LE retails. WaLMaRT so called LE edition has constant crash especially when using HD textures while my actual retail skyrim LE never have troubles. Start being honest. We appreciate repacker but pls dont waste people's time downloading useless repack.
,Timbo6669,2013-06-12T07:38Z,"lol..fck myself in the head?? wow..what a way to go!!! insults like that from a username like Gun__man....Says it all!!! Every time i mention the fact about the sites Skidrow.com and orlyb, i get trolling rants and insults come my way..for you intelligent ppl i dont have to explain what is going on...everyone, i dont give a fck.."
,Timbo6669,2013-06-12T07:40Z,And its the UPLOADERS who give us the scene releases fast and reliable...and they are hated for it..Yes some groups crack for the public now but the scene has been around since before you were a twinkle in ya dads eye mate...they used private servers before the internet was huge..THANKS STIFFY!!! THNS to the repackers - WALMART
,DarkNewb,2013-06-12T09:30Z,"be nice to koss5507783

he just a little boy with Lady Ball's"
,Becker_John,2013-06-13T14:29Z,"Works great, No problems.
Thanks for the UL. . . . 

Win7
ATI 1gb
3gb ram

Yes just 3 but the game runs great."
,tedwu,2013-06-14T06:59Z,"darn it the game did not like my right cam movement. Apparently all game update is made online servers only no more direct download. 
Might have to go back to the old non hd oddworld remember this game to be rather interesting when first tried it"
,tedwu,2013-06-14T22:19Z,"k guys if you are stuck on the ground will not move had to jump if you are still outside of the town. Solution: Turn on V Sync
IF you cannot look camera to the right or left. For my stupid mistake is make sure you assign 1 function per a key else you will have problem. Like me somehow assign mouse + or camera right (default) to fist attack. (rather easy mistake to make)
Expected some bugs and cliches until some1 can hold an update and upload it nothing we can do.
Hope it helps some of you. Good luck"
