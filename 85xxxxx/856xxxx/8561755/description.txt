The Gastro Pub

Sea Dog Steak & Ale, in Massachusetts, is looking for an executive chef who can create cutting-edge "gastro pub" cuisine. Chef Anne Burrell brings in four candidates who are tested on creating a dish for a beer pairing and making a gastro pub dish using live lobster. The two remaining chefs are each given the opportunity to run the restaurant for an evening: One chef has to trash an entire dish while the other has trouble taking control of the kitchen.
