,bluv09,2013-06-12T12:54Z,"fame girls is not closing dude. Virginia has retired but they are still keeping Ella and have a new girl as well. Before you post crap that you have no clue on do some research.

,piqas,2013-06-12T17:40Z,"Actually you're writing a piece of shit. Fame-Girls.com is going to close. Ella is going (with a new model) to famegirls.net.

This is actually a new website.

Looks like you're a kinda retarded fcktard."
,def.ault,2013-06-12T19:00Z,"Anyway, somebody got a similar nice complete collection of fame-girls.com's predecessor ff-models? I guess I have most of Sandra's sets, but none of Virginia's, since all the old torrents are either dead or incomplete. Maybe someone can reseed these old torrents?"
,piqas,2013-06-12T19:31Z,I also got FF-Models complete but i cant post em here for reasons known..
,def.ault,2013-06-13T11:49Z,"""cant post em here for reasons known.. ""

sorry, what do you mean?"
,piqas,2013-06-13T17:46Z,The Models werent in legal age for TPB. NN-Underage (17-) are not allowed anymore on TPB.
,def.ault,2013-06-14T00:27Z,"I followed some of these discussions on suprbay, and it's hardly a policy, because nn-sites aren't illegal. It's more a point-of-view thing. The worst thing that can happen is some admin deleting the torrent entries - if somebody finds them offensive at all. But anyway, I didn't know ff-models had pictures of very young girls, like some of the newstar models for instance, which are indeed alarmingly young. I don't want stuff like this anyway, but all the Sandra sets I have are pretty decent, I guess she had been like 15 or 16, and they don't seem 'abusive' or 'offensive' to me. Why don't you just cut out all the 'child-like' sets (if there really are such) and just release the non-offensive ones?"
,def.ault,2013-06-14T00:31Z,"but hey, I don't want to be pushy on this! I'm fine with your fame-girls rels. Just don't let me bother you. ;)"
,piqas,2013-06-14T08:05Z,There are other ways to trade you know. TPB isnt the end of the internet ;-) Can i reach you via TORChat?
,def.ault,2013-06-14T13:17Z,"sure, but I don't like to post my ID here. if you like, you can email me on 

def.ault.tor [at] hmamail.com

it's a self-destruct account that will work for the next 7 days. :)"
