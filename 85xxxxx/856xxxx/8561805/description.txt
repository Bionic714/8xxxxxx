Description

History parts 1-4 by Louie Giglio:

Creation. Beauty. Perfection. Simplicity. Freedom. Life.

All of these, God freely gave to man, His prized creation, placing him in a perfect world designed to reflect His glory.

Yet, in an instant, all of life was corrupted. The beauty of everything God so beautifully birthed was tainted by creatures who willingly rebelled against their Creator. Suddenly and tragically, life was covered with death, freedom was bound by sin, and beauty was lost. God's glory on earth had seemingly been scarred forever.

Then, when all hope of restoration was lost, history took an altogether unexpected turn. In the midst of death, God came in human form---not to punish or destroy the traitor race, but to weave even the darkest of sins into a tapestry of His glory.

History truly is His story. The greatest story ever told. Find your place in the adventure and discover amazing life that never ends.

This is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


Ephesians 5:11
11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.

      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS
