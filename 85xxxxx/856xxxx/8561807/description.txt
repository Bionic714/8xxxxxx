Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, June 10 edition of The Alex Jones Show, guest host Mike Adams, The Health Ranger, sits in, as Alex returns to the U.S. following a victorious and invigorating trip to sunny England where he was at the forefront of confronting and exposing the quasi-secretive Bilderberg group. 

Mike will be breaking down the latest info regarding the tidal wave of scandals overtaking the White House as the Obama Administration scurries into damage control PR mode, all the while joking about disappearing whistleblowers. 

On today's show, Mike welcomes investigative journalist Jon Rappoport to analyze the apparent war on whistleblowers, and author and American journalist Jim Marrs to relate his take on the NSA's massive spy grid. 

Rep. Steve Stockman also details the White House's nefarious role in the NSA spying scandal, and points out why Americans should be well beyond the point of outrage.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
