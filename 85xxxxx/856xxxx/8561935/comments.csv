I definately don't have the london series. Most of what I have are from 2000 and onward, but I'll try to look for it though. It's very old so I may not be able to find it. I am uploading the Plague of the Living Dead series soon though!"

I will be uploading ""The Dead - Kingdom of Flies"" comic which does take place somewhere in London, or the UK in general but I'll still keep an eye out for the Living Dead London series!"
,oskar5000,2013-06-11T02:06Z,"Thanks, Robbie, I should have remembered it was pretty old. I read the first one years ago and never found the second!"
