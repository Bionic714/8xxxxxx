While taking a break in the bush, Shyam, a painter and musician, meets with Pammi, a jungle beauty who has a herd of elephants at her command. Both dramatically fall in love, but must part company temporarily in order to let him seek his mother's blessings and get married. When Shyam returns home, his mother, Sita, is relieved to see him alive as she had been told by Diwan that he had been missing.
