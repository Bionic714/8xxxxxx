A documentary featuring interviews with all surviving former heads of Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency whose activities and membership are closely held state secrets.

This version was captured from URPlay (http://urplay.se/Produkter/175199-Varlden-Gatekeepers). It has the original soundtrack (Hebrew, no french voice-over or dubbing). Swedish subtitles are hard coded.

Any volunteers for English subs?
