So my email/Paypal is johnhalmgren@gmail.com, if you're sending directly be sure to write your UDID and contact email in payment description. I will manage to activate it within 3 hours.

Thanks!"

,tylermarcus14,2013-06-13T15:53Z,Using the method to GET iOS 7 WITHOUT REGISTERING UDID will cause the phone to become very glitchy.  This will cause many problems with your phone and is not recommended.  UPDATING to iOS 7 instead of using the recommended method of RESTORING to iOS 7 will cause the phone to become extremely glitchy. This is because you are installing iOS 7 on top of iOS 6 instead of removing iOS 6 for iOS 7.

If you want to have your iOS 7 to not be deactivated by apple I suggest you have a developer active it."

,saumil89,2013-06-15T17:49Z,"Okay People, don't get fooled by people asking for payment or with the reason of it is laggy without UDID!

If I can run iOS 7 perfectly on my iPhone 4 without any glitches.

Here's the trick to avoid the glitches (What I did)
The update (iOS 7) will ONLY upgrade your current OS keeping intact ALL the settings THUS making it laggy.

Download iOS 6.1.3 or 6.1.4 (iPhone 5), Take backup of ONLY contacts, save your photos.

RESTORE the iPhone to 6.1.3 or 6.1.4, CLEAN Install (JUST Install the OS, do not change or fiddle with nething)
Now, Keep holding left shift key and click on check for updates and select the iOS 7, your phone will start updating.

Once done, download & install the apps from iTunes, restore contact backup from cloud or any app and photos, music, etc.

And then open settings and change it as per your requirements.
Close all APPS and restart the phone.

It WILL WORK PERFECTLY !

Let me know if this trick works for you."

,ebarne,2013-06-17T02:10Z,NOT so simple to install without Apple developer account. You can try and have a useless iPhone/ iPad or play it safe for $4 (paypal only) email me your UDID and ill add it to my developer account to activate you as a developer. If you are not sure how to get your UDID- Click on serial number in ITunes. I have 90 slots still available iosdevelopin@gmail.com- give me about an hr to activate.
