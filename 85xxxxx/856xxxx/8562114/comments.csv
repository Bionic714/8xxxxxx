,justcy,2013-06-11T01:52Z,"For reference: 

This is the North America / Canada AT&T version of iOS 7 Beta one for the iPhone 5.

Because this is a beta, Apple should still be signing iOS 6.1.4, and should something go wrong, you should be able to recover your device in DFU mode."

If this method doesn't work try updating your iPhone to 6.1.4 first !


FrankRica Wrote

JUSTCY:
CONFIRMED:
YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A VALID DEVELOPER ACCOUNT TO USE THIS BETA AS LONG AS YOU USE THE FOLLOWING STEPS. 

DO NOT LET ANYBODY CON YOU INTO PAYING MONEY FOR A UDID UNLOCK:

1) Download the torrent (You're doing that now)
2) Open iTunes.
3) Plug in your iDevice
4) In Windows, press SHIFT+CHECK FOR UPDATES (for Mac, press OPTION+CHECK FOR UPDATES) NOTE THAT THIS STEP IS CRITICAL. DO NOT SELECT RESTORE IPHONE OR YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACTIVATE.
5) Select the ipsw.
6) Follow the prompts and enjoy iOS 7."
,tylermarcus14,2013-06-13T15:54Z,Using the method to GET iOS 7 WITHOUT REGISTERING UDID will cause the phone to become very glitchy.  This will cause many problems with your phone and is not recommended.  UPDATING to iOS 7 instead of using the recommended method of RESTORING to iOS 7 will cause the phone to become extremely glitchy. This is because you are installing iOS 7 on top of iOS 6 instead of removing iOS 6 for iOS 7.

,saumil89,2013-06-15T17:52Z,"Okay People, don't get fooled by people asking for payment or with the reason of it is laggy without UDID!

If I can run iOS 7 perfectly on my iPhone 4 without any glitches.

Here's the trick to avoid the glitches (What I did)
The update (iOS 7) will ONLY upgrade your current OS keeping intact ALL the settings THUS making it laggy.

Download iOS 6.1.3 or 6.1.4 (iPhone 5), Take backup of ONLY contacts, save your photos.

RESTORE the iPhone to 6.1.3 or 6.1.4, CLEAN Install (JUST Install the OS, do not change or fiddle with nething)
Now, Keep holding left shift key and click on check for updates and select the iOS 7, your phone will start updating.

Once done, download & install the apps from iTunes, restore contact backup from cloud or any app and photos, music, etc.

And then open settings and change it as per your requirements.
Close all APPS and restart the phone.

It WILL WORK PERFECTLY !

Let me know if this trick works for you."

If you are not sure how to get your UDID- Click on serial number in ITunes. I have 90 slots still available iosdevelopin@gmail.com- give me about an hr to activate.
