,vlad1501,2013-06-11T08:35Z,"Word of Advice:
1) Do not install this if your iphone 5 is not model A1429
2) Do no install if your iphone5 UDID is not registered as an developer device.
3) Backup first before installing.
4) Be careful of scammers.

Or your phone will get bricked."

,deepankar,2013-06-13T01:04Z,"GET iOS 7 WITHOUT REGISTERING UDID

If this method doesn't work try updating your iPhone to 6.1.4 first !


FrankRica Wrote

JUSTCY:
CONFIRMED:
YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A VALID DEVELOPER ACCOUNT TO USE THIS BETA AS LONG AS YOU USE THE FOLLOWING STEPS. 

DO NOT LET ANYBODY CON YOU INTO PAYING MONEY FOR A UDID UNLOCK:

1) Download the torrent (You're doing that now)
2) Open iTunes.
3) Plug in your iDevice
4) In Windows, press SHIFT+CHECK FOR UPDATES (for Mac, press OPTION+CHECK FOR UPDATES) NOTE THAT THIS STEP IS CRITICAL. DO NOT SELECT RESTORE IPHONE OR YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACTIVATE.
5) Select the ipsw.
6) Follow the prompts and enjoy iOS 7."
,toadypoli,2013-06-13T06:45Z,OMG Deepanker/FrankRica! Thank you! That actually worked! And I was about to spend 5 dollars on UDID registration. 
,tylermarcus14,2013-06-13T15:52Z,Using the method to GET iOS 7 WITHOUT REGISTERING UDID will cause the phone to become very glitchy.  This will cause many problems with your phone and is not recommended.  UPDATING to iOS 7 instead of using the recommended method of RESTORING to iOS 7 will cause the phone to become extremely glitchy. This is because you are installing iOS 7 on top of iOS 6 instead of removing iOS 6 for iOS 7.

,ebarne,2013-06-17T02:09Z,NOT so simple to install without Apple developer account. You can try and have a useless iPhone/ iPad or play it safe for $4 (paypal only) email me your UDID and ill add it to my developer account to activate you as a developer. If you are not sure how to get your UDID- Click on serial number in ITunes. I have 90 slots still available iosdevelopin@gmail.com- give me about an hr to activate.
