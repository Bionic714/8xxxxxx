[V],wushdishmeen,2013-06-12T17:51Z,"Monday there was a major accident in my area that knocked out internet.  I mentioned this on torrents.  Nothing I can do.

I still managed to get the shows up on our network by tethering my phone to my laptop.  So I am by no means ""slacking"".

TPB is not my top priority guys.  I've said it before.  I do this as an extra courtesy to people who haven't joined WDM yet.

The shows go up much earlier on WDM and then the torrents go up here last once I've served the WDM community.  But even when TPB is down we still offer the torrents hosted locally on WDM so TPB crashing doesn't effect seeding.

Tuesday TPB was down all day (for me at least) and didn't come back until just now (Wednesday @ noon).

If you join WDM you won't have to worry about TPB.  Just a suggestion.

Things are back to normal today.  6/12 show will be up in 30 mins"
