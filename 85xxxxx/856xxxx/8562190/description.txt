 Here's an ultra-rare IFD superproduction, by Tomas Tang and co. Filmed both in HK and San Francisco, featuring a Thai pop singer, a mustachioed big badass, some lions, orcas, a 19th century indian tribe and their Chief "Leader Car", 2 gweilos fighting each other with M16s in a subplot, a golden Buddha, the best pick-up line of the 80s, spandex and more...

 Plot: Mr Lee is after a "golden Buddha" but is double crossed by one of his employee. In the process some guy and his son are killed, so his brother Alex goes mad and seek revenge. He follows Lee's henchmen to San Fransisco, goes to a strip club, a casino, then he's saved and healed by indians before finally raiding the bad guy's lair with his friends (a Thai pop singer, a CIA agent and a chick with a bow and arrows).
