YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A VALID DEVELOPER ACCOUNT TO USE THIS BETA AS LONG AS YOU USE THE FOLLOWING STEPS.  

DO NOT LET ANYBODY CON YOU INTO PAYING MONEY FOR A UDID UNLOCK:

1) Download the torrent (You're doing that now)
2) Open iTunes.
3) Plug in your iDevice
4) In Windows, press SHIFT+CHECK FOR UPDATES (for Mac, press OPTION+CHECK FOR UPDATES) NOTE THAT THIS STEP IS CRITICAL.  DO NOT SELECT RESTORE IPHONE OR YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO ACTIVATE.
5) Select the ipsw.

,bogidon,2013-06-11T04:16Z,Great! Now all we need is Xcode 5...
,byloav,2013-06-11T04:31Z,Can someone confirm you do not need UDID to install?
,txjzam93,2013-06-11T04:34Z,"It's telling me that this version is non compatible, what I have a sprint phone... could that be the reason? "
,byloav,2013-06-11T04:42Z,Confirmation of justcy statement?
,sydster_,2013-06-11T04:57Z,"It works like a charm! I followed the steps and I'm now rocking iOS 7. The OS lags sometimes, but it's only a beta, so besides that, it's awesome!"
,napstercc,2013-06-11T04:59Z,"didn't work for me. Itunes showed a message saying. (-1) ... didn't work.

I'll wait till they release the real one"
,justcy,2013-06-11T05:42Z,"For those of you who aren't having luck, ensure that  you have a GSM variant iPhone 5 (AT&T or T-Mobile)  You'll have to look elsewhere for a CDMA version (Sprint and Verizon).

It works.  Take my word for it."
,frankw,2013-06-11T06:06Z,"Confirmed, justcy's instructions worked. "
,Room112,2013-06-11T06:15Z,Worked like a charm. Thanks justcy!! Thanks OmarNajdi!!
,frankw,2013-06-11T06:24Z,But iMessage does not work as the phone is not activated without UDID
,chax21,2013-06-11T06:41Z,Great Work!
,Jasio46,2013-06-11T07:07Z,"Justcy, is frankw correct in saying  that iMessage does not work because the iPhone is not activated with your method? Is the UDID method required for activation? "
,Dynazamb,2013-06-11T07:50Z,"I am activating UDIDs for 5 USD via paypal. Paypal email is miraclemagic2145@gmail.com please put your UDID in the note with payment. I also accept Bitcoin or Litecoin for a discounted price, email me if you would like to pay with BTC or LTC."
,sizzzle13,2013-06-11T08:53Z,i tried justcy's method and it worked until it came time to start the phone. now its telling me that it cant activate my phone because its not registered with the developer program. and i cant go back to iOS 6 so i'm stuck without a phone. HELP!!!!!!!
,justcy,2013-06-11T13:08Z,"That's odd.  iMessage is fully functional for me, and I don't have a developer account.  I suppose your actual milage will vary....

Which brings me to my next point.

The rumors floating around about being unable to downgrade are absolutely bologna. YOU CAN.

Put your phone into DFU mode and download 6.1.4 (Apple is, of course, still signing this version).

There are quite a few bugs present and there are some apps that simply don't work (such as Skype), but the overall experience looks promising."
,justcy,2013-06-11T13:13Z,"To put your phone in DFU mode, do the following:

1) Make sure your phone is booted
2) Plug your phone into your computer and start iTunes
3) Hold the power and home buttons until the screen cuts off, and continue to do so for about 5 seconds afterward.
4) Remove your finger from the power button while continuing to hold the home button
5) Your phone will bleep and itunes till inform you that you're in DFU mode.

From here, you can click on Recover iPhone and it will downgrade you.

I tested it this morning when I downgraded."
,Crusen,2013-06-11T15:28Z,can you use this ipsw on iPhone 4S?

DO NOT PAY ANYONE TO ACTIVATE!"
,DavidHanLee,2013-06-11T19:02Z,"For people that may have problems installing iOS 7, an issue I ran into was that I need to update iTunes. Once iTunes is updated you are set.

The difference for those wondering between A1428 and A1429 is that A1428 is for North America and A1429 is for those that are international."
,zoppley,2013-06-11T22:44Z,"Immediate LEGIT developers activations available!

I am an Apple Developer with UDID's available. If you want to activate your iOS 7 please paypal 5 USD to ios7devbeta@gmail.com

(along with your device UDID) your device will be activated as developer in a few minutes. Many devices already activated today, many slots still available."
,petterdev,2013-06-12T12:25Z,"Hi everyone! What ever happens you still need your UDID to be registered to get future beta versions. Me and my friend have totally 50 left or so. We offer activations for 2.50USD each.

,Iphixtit,2013-06-12T18:57Z,I had a Jailbroken iPhone 5 (A1428) with ios 6.1.2 but love the new ios 7 enough to lose my jailbreak. To install this without UDID Registration you must first Restore to ios (6.1.4 for iPhone 5) & be sure to setup iPhone as new. Then Press (alt or option & Click Update for Mac) or (Shift & Update for Windows). So far I have installed 64 apps and only the eBay app doesn't work. Thank you very much for the upload.
,der_earnshaw,2013-06-12T19:14Z,"so the install and everything worked, but i just had a question. Will this be supported for updates to come up through september?? I am just curious because i thought that was what the UDID was set up for or if that won't have an effect on it. "
,pjones452,2013-06-12T20:53Z,so rad thank you! like justcy said Do Not Pay For a UDID!

,tylermarcus14,2013-06-13T15:51Z,Using the method to GET iOS 7 WITHOUT REGISTERING UDID will cause the phone to become very glitchy.  This will cause many problems with your phone and is not recommended.  UPDATING to iOS 7 instead of using the recommended method of RESTORING to iOS 7 will cause the phone to become extremely glitchy. This is because you are installing iOS 7 on top of iOS 6 instead of removing iOS 6 for iOS 7.

,kinix,2013-06-14T02:44Z,"Looks like this is solid- but a couple questions.
1) When I install this, is this going to completely blank my OS and replace it? Will I need to re-download all my apps, personal content, etc?
2) What is the difference between a developer and some other person activating the UDID?
3) Who will activate my UDID the cheapest?"
,kinix,2013-06-14T02:50Z,Another question- has anyone had any stability problems or anything of the like lately?

,ebarne,2013-06-17T01:55Z,NOT so simple to install without Apple developer account. You can try and have a useless iPhone/ iPad or play it safe and send me $4 and your UDID thru paypal and ill add it to my developer account. If you are not sure how to get your UDID- Click on serial number in ITunes. I have 90 slots still available iosdevelopin@gmail.com
