This Encode has been tested and does work on Windows Media Player, VLC, Potplayer, Media Player Classic
If you have playback issues try installing the newest version of http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_mega_codec/ 
And Also works using MPC-HC ( http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm ).
I reccommend using http://thumperdc.com/forum/advanced-video-playback-a-white-paper-t70686.html for best video playback.
if you wish to convert the movie from MKV format to MP4 follow this link or search Google 'MKV to MP4', it's a very easy process taking less than 5 minutes
