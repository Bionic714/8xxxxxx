This episode is already posted ( http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/5042161/Underwater_Dream_Machine-%28WTC-SWE%29 ) but the torrent is dead. The quality of this one isn't the best at parts on a big screen but it's still watchable.

Please seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others. My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.
If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
