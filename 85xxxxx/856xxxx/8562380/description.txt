
Get ready for the wildest two-wheel ride on the Google Play! Xtreme Wheels takes you on an amazing, hazard filled trip over explosives, ladders, barrels, twisted ramps, huge gaps, and precarious cargo containers all on a powerful trial bike.

Balance and speed are what you will need to complete the increasingly difficult courses without breaking every bone in your riders body! Explosive barrels line the course and can be your friend or lethal foe by boosting your speed and height or bringing a very quick end to your riding career. 

Whether you survive as a champion or fall to the ground as a loser, Xtreme Wheels promises to be a spectacle both in gameplay and visuals, making it an eye-popping experience unlike any other on a handheld device.
