,crumrugin,2013-06-11T07:53Z,If the sound is as much better than other ups as the video looks from the screen shot then we have a good thing here...thanx Bone
,crumrugin,2013-06-11T08:47Z,Watchable best Ive seen v7 for a cam audio is weird like it went thru a frame at a time noise filter that filtered out way too much a5 not alot of echo and has some bass but irritating  noisy artifacts everywhere..so ehh if you cant wait?
