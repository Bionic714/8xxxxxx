===================== NOTE =====================
.

If any of MY torrents get NO or only a few Comments

Then I take this as:

You never liked the series
You never liked the quality
You are ALL very ill-mannered

It does no matter which one of the above, but

I will not post any more in that series.
I will not re-seed any torrent that has no comments

I never reseed for downloaders I do not know
If you've never posted a comment on my torrents I do not know you
Do not ask for a re-seed you will be ignored
.
Once 5 people complete I stop seeding
.
[b]I do NOT expect comments on how great I am, I already know that
Comments on quality help YOU the downloaders[/b]
