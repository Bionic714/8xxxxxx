,rydawg09,2013-06-15T08:00Z,"""Split"" is the audio directly from the CD, but split into individual MP3's in between each song.

""Mix"" is one large MP3 for each CD.

""Unmix"" is the full length version of each song in the release.

The ""Mix"" or ""split"" versions are the ones you want to download if you want to listen to the CDs the way the DJs intended.

If you just want to listen to the songs get the ""Unmix"" version."
