,rupert3k,2013-06-13T11:51Z,"Sounds fine to me, thanks Rise.
It does have a lot of gain but no distortion & I appreciate getting it 3 days early."
,studio11,2013-06-13T12:14Z,Yeah it's low quality. Why do people do this? FFS!
,rupert3k,2013-06-14T01:29Z,"What a bunch of whingers, it's out today anyway, Rise let us sample this great album early & all you do is whine, laaaame!
At least now when a lossless rip materialises we can enjoy it straight off the bat.
Thank you Luke & Nick!"
