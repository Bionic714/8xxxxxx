This is a pdf with two versions of the Refresher Training Test you have to take once a year with Securitas.  They all have answers circled and were done to the best of my ability but are not guaranteed to all be right.  I find taking the test annoying (it can take you 6 hours), so I am uploading the answers to make it go faster for other Securitas security guards. I am only aware of two versions of the test.
