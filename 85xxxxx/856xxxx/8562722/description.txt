There are an incredible number of benefits to using coconut oil in everyday life. The moment I realized this, my life underwent a small revolution. Now, not a day goes by in my own family when we arenΓÇÖt using it for a myriad of reasons.

From minor infections to serious diseases, coconut oil cures it all. It does this in a completely delicious way, too! Coconut oil is one dose of ΓÇ£medicineΓÇ¥ no one in your family will hesitate to take, especially once theyΓÇÖve learned about the good itΓÇÖs doing them.

Throughout this book, IΓÇÖm going to open your eyes to these benefits. LetΓÇÖs begin with the basics.

We know about some of the benefits from studying Pacific Islanders, for whom using coconut oil is a way of life. Research shows that the studied islanders were completely devoid of issues such as kidney disease, high cholesterol, and obesity ΓÇô issues we have come to accept as only being cured by pharmaceuticals. Yet regular consumption of coconut oil has shown that in fact the opposite is true.

ItΓÇÖs easy to eat and digest coconut oil. In fact, ingesting coconut oil can be very cleansing to the colon. Coconut oil also helps to dissolve and remove toxins from the body. This helps those who ingest it to maintain ideal and healthy weights.
