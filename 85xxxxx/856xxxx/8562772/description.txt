Description:

With the whereabouts of his last paycheck still unknown, the Killer has to shelve his plans for some peace and quiet, and new clients are knocking at the door. There's no passing up a serious job right now, and no time to be choosy about clientele. In fact, his new client isn't giving him a choice, and there's a chance he knows something the Killer wants: the answer to what went wrong in Paris. The stakes are rising, but the Killer's ready to play the game: keeping his head and putting holes in everyone else's.
