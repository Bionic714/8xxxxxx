"The Glades", a character driven police procedural set in the fictional town of Palm Glade, Florida, stars Australian actor Matt Passmore ("McLeod's Daughters," "Underbelly" ), Kiele Sanchez ("Lost," "Samantha Who?" ) and Carlos Gomez ("Shark," "Sleeper Cell" ). In "The Glades", Passmore stars as Jim Longworth, an attractive, brilliant, yet hard to get along with homicide detective from Chicago who after being wrongfully accused of sleeping with his former Captain's wife is forced into exile. Longworth relocates to the sleepy, middle of nowhere town of Palm Glade, Florida, where the sunshine and golf are plentiful and crime is seemingly at a minimum. Yet life in this sleepy town is not as beautiful as it may seem.
