Diamond Doll is a female fronted hard rock band from HawkeΓÇÖs Bay, New Zealand.

The band formed in 2010 and features three of four members of the now disbanded Oxboy. Expect heavy but melodic; the hard edge of metal with a rock foundation and punk rock attitude. Diamond Doll bring the noise but they donΓÇÖt forget the music.

Included in this download is their debut 4-track EP 'Plus None' and a bonus track, their first single 'Consume'. All tracks are high quality mp3's.
