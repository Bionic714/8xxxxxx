[V],QborT,2013-06-15T18:54Z,"TPB runs on hamster power, and I am one of the many hamster breeders/trainers that provide these critters to help run TPB... Basically everytime TPB is down it's because of problems with the hamsters.  You know how it goes, sometimes they die or we need to clean out the cages (fresh woodchips and water).  Other times it can be a full on hamster revolt, then you gotta call in the Guinea Pig Patrol it's a huge ordeal... You never know what to expect with those crafty creatures. ;)

But on a more serious note, don't worry about my skull.  Just download this awesome anime... There is a trailer at IMDB (link at top of page or you can check it out on youtube)."
