Sean King and Michelle Maxwell aren’t your typical private investigators. Both are former Secret Service agents, and their unique skills – not to mention their razor-sharp chemistry – give them a leg up on conventional law enforcement. Maxwell is a former elite athlete who uses her brains, beauty, and Beltway connections to solve cases. King’s Secret Service career ended when the candidate he was assigned to protect was assassinated, sending him in a downward spiral. Today, King has added a law degree to his arsenal of skills, allowing him to navigate the system in ways a typical private investigator never could. When a lawyer friend of Sean’s is mysteriously murdered, Sean decides to represent the serial killer, an autistic savant that his friend was defending in hopes to discover what happened to him. Together, King and Maxwell discover a possible plot that has political repercussions."
