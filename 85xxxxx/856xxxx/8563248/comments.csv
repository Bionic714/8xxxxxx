That's a very interesting bit of info you linked to there, thanks for your input, it is indeed food for thought. I can't find the actual ""sample.exe"" on my system though (win7 64-bit), I notice that it is a registry entry/value only.

If you come back to this page, please could you give a little further explanation about this point?, I would appreciate this out of interest & curiosity.

Having said that, I've been using several of 'TorDigger's uploads for a while and so far ALL uploads are VERY reliable & CLEAN, including this one as far as I can tell.

I use Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 (fully manually updated) and MalwareBytes for 2nd opinion, also occasionally Hitman Pro."
,bert16,2013-06-14T00:16Z,I totally agree about TorDigger's upload. They're all clean and virtually guaranteed to work as advertized. We owe him a debt of gratitude.
