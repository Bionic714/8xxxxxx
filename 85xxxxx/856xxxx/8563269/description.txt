What's new in VLC media player 2.0.7:
June 10th, 2013

2.0.7 is a small update that fixes some regressions of the 2.0.x branch of VLC. 
2.0.7 fixes track selection for PowerPC machines.
2.0.7 also fixes an important regression in decoding numerous audio file formats and when encoding in MP3 and AAC.
2.0.7 closes a couple of security issues and fixes regression in our ActiveX plugin for Internet Explorer.
With faster decoding on multi-core, GPU, and mobile hardware and the ability to open more formats, notably professional, HD and 10bits codecs, 2.0 was a major upgrade for VLC.
