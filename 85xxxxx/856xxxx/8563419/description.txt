Origami paperfolders from beginners to experts will delight in this extensive new collection from the authors of Essential Origami. The New Origami contains dozens of original projects that employ cutting-edge techniques, including: modular origami (using interlocking pieces of paper); performance origami (accompanied by a story or explanation); geometrical origami (illustrating principals of geometry); kasaneori or layered paperfolding (using overlapping layers to create "ribbons" of color); puzzle origami (featuring interchangeable parts that create a brain-teasing effect); practical origami (making useable objects like envelopes, frames, and wallets); multiple symmetry (sinking, pleating, and folding to create symmetrical patterns and shapes). Each technique is accompanied by easy-to-follow, two-color illustrations.
