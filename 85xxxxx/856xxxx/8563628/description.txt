Marked (Eternal Guardians #1) by Elisabeth Naughton (May 27th 2010)

THERONΓÇöDark haired, duty bound and deceptively deadly. HeΓÇÖs the leader of the Argonauts, an elite group of guardians that defends the immortal realm from threats of the Underworld.

From the moment he walked into the club, Casey knew this guy was different. Men like that just didnΓÇÖt exist in real lifeΓÇösilky shoulder-length hair, chest impossibly broad, and a predatory manner that just screamed dark and dangerous. He was looking for something. Her.

She was the one. She had the mark. Casey had to die so his kind could live, and it was TheronΓÇÖs duty to bring her in. But even as a 200-year-old descendent of Hercules, he wasnΓÇÖt strong enough to resist the pull in her fathomless eyes, to tear himself away from the heat of her body.

As war with the Underworld nears, someone will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.

Entwined (Eternal Guardians #2) by Elisabeth Naughton (July 27th 2010)

Forces of daemons are gathering and have broken through the barriers of the Underworld. Now more than ever the Eternal Guardians are needed to protect both their own realm and the human world. Zander can't afford to think about what might have been with the bewitching physician he once regarded as his soul mate. But with eternity stretching out before him, he also can't fathom spending his life without the one woman who makes him feel most alive. Perhaps he's found his weakness, after all . . .

Tempted (Eternal Guardians #3) by Elisabeth Naughton (September 6th 2011)

DEMETRIUSΓÇöHeΓÇÖs the hulking, brooding warrior his fellow Guardians avoid. Too dark. Too damaged. And given his heritage, he knows itΓÇÖs best to keep everyone at armΓÇÖs length. 

Isadora is missing. The words pounded through his head like a frantic drumbeat. For her own protection, Demetrius had done all he could to avoid the fragile princess, his soul mate. And now she was goneΓÇökidnapped. To get her back, heΓÇÖll have to go to the black place in his soul heΓÇÖs always shunned. As daemons ravage the human realm and his loyalty to the Guardians is put to the ultimate test, Demetrius realizes that Isadora is stronger than anyone thought. And finally letting her into his heart may be the only way to save them both.

Enraptured (Eternal Guardians #4) by Elisabeth Naughton (April 3rd 2012)

Orpheus--To most he's an enigma, a devil-may-care rogue who does whatever he pleases whenever he wants. Now this loose cannon is part of the Eternal Guardians--elite warriors assigned to protect the human realm--whether he likes it or not.

Orpheus has just one goal: to rescue his brother from the Underworld. He's not expecting a woman to get in the way. Especially not a Siren as gorgeous as Skyla. He has no idea she's an assassin sent by Zeus to seduce, entrap, and ultimately destroy him.

Yet Skyla herself might have the most to lose. There's a reason Orpheus feels so familiar to her, a reason her body seems to crave him. Perhaps he's not the man everyone thinks... The truth could reveal a deadly secret as old as the Eternal Guardians themselves.

Enslaved (Eternal Guardians #5) by Elisabeth Naughton (November 6th 2012)

After being rescued from the Underworld, Gryphon is plauged by strange voices and an evil foreboding. He believes that his only hope for salvation is to track down the goddess who cursed him...until he meets Maelea. 
A prisoner with no bars, Maelea encounters Gryphon on her quest to find Olympus. He's about to test her loyalty to the gods, and she's ready to find out if he still has a heart worth saving...

Bound (Eternal Guardians #6) by Elisabeth Naughton (March 23rd 2013)

TITUSΓÇöTo most his gift seems like a blessing, but for him itΓÇÖs a curse the other Eternal GuardiansΓÇöthose who protect the mortal realm from threats of the UnderworldΓÇöseek to exploit. One he would gladly trade for the chance to be freeΓÇª

Obsessed. Her touch is like a drug. From the moment he met her, Titus knew she was different. Even dangerous. Yet though his guardian brethren are convinced Natasa is working for Hades, Titus canΓÇÖt stop thinking about her. CanΓÇÖt stop fantasizing about her. CanΓÇÖt stop craving the one thing he knows could lead to the downfall of his world.

Possessed. Faced with stopping Natasa or joining in her quest, Titus falls to temptation and is thrust into a world of lust, deception, and deadly treachery designed by the gods. Her touchΓÇöonly hersΓÇöfrees him from his bonds, but desire may just condemn him. Because before the end heΓÇÖll have to decide which is more important: duty and honor to those he took an oath to defend, or a woman who could very well be the biggest curse to them all.


Seed and Enjoy!
