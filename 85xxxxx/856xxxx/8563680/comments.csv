This film stars Ed Harris and David Duchovny, so you'd think we would have heard about it and it would have done better at the Box Office.

Thanks for the up, it's definitely worth a watch."

,sconlan,2013-06-12T09:59Z,Appreciate the effort but whats with the HDRip in the title??? this is 272p... Isn't HD 720 or 1080? Or is the source HD?

,orphen2121,2013-06-12T15:47Z,"V= 8 
A= 6 audio was a bit low good thing it had subs
M= 8"
,uheardmebitch,2013-06-12T20:38Z,audio and video were great [audio is lowish] movie is good but a shit ending IMHO
,mr2old,2013-06-12T20:42Z,I notice a TON of the movies put out on here have very low audio.  That or super quiet for half and super loud for half ..   maybe because I am using TV speakers and not a 5.1 system ?  IDK.. fuckin annoying though
[T],dark_dark_dark,2013-06-12T21:01Z,no shit about the shitty ending... shit sounds too good. and if there is something inspired by real facts in this movie i'll throw myself under a speeding car. 
,DrMD,2013-06-13T01:27Z,Pretty good until a shitty ending but A/V=9
,TQTQTQ,2013-06-13T02:14Z,"Thank you.

The sound is ok. It is standard operating procedure in submarines to maintain a low voice level, so that the vessel is not picked up by the enemy's hydrophone. 

Wouldn't it be great if all of you ungrateful leechers did some thinking or some research before complaining?"
,MailerDaemon0,2013-06-14T20:56Z,"V:8
A:8 (Its a movie about people in a submarine, they talk quieter then most)

M: 7: It was ok... not horrible but also not Oscar worthy either"
,Jack_Reacher,2013-06-15T06:08Z,"lyrical, the quality was excellent!  Thanks!!

The movie is pretty damn good.  Excellent acting.  Duchovny actually grows a pair for this film.   You won't be disappointed."
,somedude72,2013-06-15T07:10Z,"At first I couldn't understand why this movie slipped under the radar, because it seemed excellent. But right at the end it goes to a very silly place, which spoiled it for me. Still worth a watch."
,shaktigta,2013-06-16T03:18Z,"really....  this has a watermark at the beginning...

~15 seconds  but 'cmon...   a watermark... this days...  nasty AQOS"
