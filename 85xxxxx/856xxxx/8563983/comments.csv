Wrong! it's fecal...
but I suggest you quit looking that mirror !

@SKIBA100
well.. yes, I feared somebody will say this.
I know what you mean...I used both beta and final terms, look above in DESCRIPTION , the upper lines!
I should have used ""latest"" instead of ""final""...yet it does not sound so usual.
I am not using english very often but I know what final means ;))

it's final in the sense of being the latest to the date, the date which was also mentioned...for the sake of those that are hunting the 0day stuff.

by the way, the opposite to the ""beta"" notion, the term ""stable"" is better used.
i thought somebody will post such a comment and that's why I mentioned both ""beta"" (cause it's beta) and final (cause it' final also to the date) and the date itself in description...to avoid missinterpretation and also for you to know all about the thing...before deciding downloading it.

shooo!... what a long explanation... I spent this night working on computer...tongiht I'll be travelling between countries...so if you excuse me, I may go packing please, unless NSA catches me like on Edward Snowden ;)))
