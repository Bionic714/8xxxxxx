"I am Alice. Do let me hear a story."

Here and there - in the space between buildings, in back alleys, perhaps even in the underground - the Forest bleeds into our world. The Forest is a forbidden place where the rules of our world do not apply.

Our heroes must struggle against the Forest, without so much as the hope of assistance or understanding from the outside world.

They do battle against the "riddles" the Forest imposes upon them with the aid of superhuman abilities known as "gifts." 

And should they know defeat in their battle against the Forest, they will face that which they fear most - expulsion from Shinjuku.

This torrent contains the Forest visual novel by Liar-Soft translated to English by Amaterasu Translations, as well as their walkthrough, both a "simple" text version, and a more complete PowerPoint document.  The patch is already installed, so all you have to do is extract the 7z file, and run Forest.exe to begin your trip!

Now for a warning, this game IS very trippy, and you may need to play it a few times to fully grasp it so you can feel the full impact.

Enjoy, and please seed!
