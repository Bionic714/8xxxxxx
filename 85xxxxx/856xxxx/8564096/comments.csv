,PM987,2013-06-11T14:53Z,"BTW, STFmaryville, I think I might have a request that will stump you.  Return to Perdition, by Max Allan Collins and Terry Beatty.  The sequel to Road to Perdition featuring the grown-up Vietnam Vet son of the kid from the first story.  Road to Perdition and its 3 prequels are available but I checked other sites and have not been able to find Return to Perdition, which came out it November 2012.  Thanks for any leads."
,kelleytoons,2013-06-11T15:23Z,"Thanks for the digital releases -- while I bought all the ones you have uploaded when they were in print, I kind of hate to buy them again just to read them on my iPad, so you're a treasure!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-11T15:54Z,"me too, these are great to have on my kindle, though i do most of my reading on my laptop. sad that they didn't include the letters pages -- i had a letter printed in one of these -- and worse, DC has omitted the Ross pencil sketches that ran on the original back covers!  :-(  bad DC, bad bad!"
,bloominoctober,2013-06-11T15:55Z,"Thanks STFmaryville! Great series!

Quick question:  any idea where Kick-Ass 3 #1 is?  New books release tomorrow, and I've yet to see this one from last week.  Just curious.

Thanks, as always."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-11T15:56Z,"PM987, it doesn't appear that it has been scanned by anyone yet. the only thing i can add to your frustration is to tell you that the 1st edition hardcover came out in late 2011 rather than '12."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-11T16:40Z,"bloominoctober, unlike most marvel, dc & image comics, millar's comics do NOT come out ""same day digital"". (for another example, you still couldn't download millar & quitely's jupiter's legacy #1, published in april from comixology if you wanted to.)

now why haven't any of the scanners went down to the local comic shop, bought a copy, and scanned it? your guess is as good as mine! i have no idea why not."
,bloominoctober,2013-06-11T16:54Z,"Thanks for the clarification, STF.  I wasn't aware of the (what I'll dub) ""digital delay"" with Millar's comics."
,ggaanneesshhaa,2013-06-11T16:55Z,"Road to Perdition and its sequel would be two excellent additions. Go ahead, STFmaryville!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-11T17:28Z,"road to perdition and the 3-part ""on the road to perdition"" are available and seeded:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4430337/Road_To_Perdition_graphic_novels"
