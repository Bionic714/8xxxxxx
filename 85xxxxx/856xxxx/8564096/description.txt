One of the best series of the last 20 years! Here are the new 2013 digital editions (from DC) of the 1995 six-issue miniseries that introduced a fictional American city and the ordinary people that live there, coping in many different ways with the heroes and villains that walk -- and fly -- among them. This series reunited Alex Ross (cover artist, character designs and co-plotter) with his creative partner from MARVELS, writer Kurt Busiek, and reintroduced the fantastic art of Brent Anderson.

These are the new digital HD releases from DC Comics (which owns Wildstorm, the first home of Astro City under "Homage Comics") courtesy of Son of Ultron-Empire. They are 1920 pixel width images.

Truly a must-download, must-read, must-keep set!

An Amazon review of the collected edition of these 6 issues:

Breathing new life into a tired genre
December 31, 2000
By John Dennett

For those seasoned veterans of comic book fandom, Kurt Busiek's Astro City series is a breath of fresh air in a stuffy, over-crowded room.

Far from the deconstructionist bent of Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, et al, Busiek *loves* superheroes and all the accompanying absurdity. His goal, as eloquently expressed in his introduction to this volume, is to explore the as yet uncharted themes, metaphors and plots while holding dear all of the magic and power of what came before.

While Astro City may prove a bit frustrating for a comics newcomer, it's a warm and inviting destination for the weary superhero fan.
