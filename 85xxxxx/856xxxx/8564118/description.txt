 Recommendations Optional:

 - Make exceptions to Directory %ProgramFiles%KMSpico*.exe in Antivirus or Defender.

 How This Program Works:

 1. Install KMSPico v6 in Windows.
 2. Run automatically KMSELDI and AutoPico.
 2.1 Make Tokens Backup.
 2.2 Detect VL or Retail (Windows) and depending of the License Status activate or convert to VL.
 2.3 Activate for 180 days all VL products found.
 3. Install a windows service that reactive every windows start.
 4. Create a task schedule for AutoPico to run every 24 hours.

 Change Log:
 - Add convertion from Retail non activated windows to VL.
 - Add Install of windows key in case it does not exist.
 - Add wrapper dll for x86 and x64.
 - KMSELDI now works only with the deagles's emulator.
