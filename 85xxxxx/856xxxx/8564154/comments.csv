,palomino92,2013-06-11T16:16Z,the audio is not right (for me anyways). i think you switched it with the cocaine feature. 
,TWEETY2455,2013-06-13T00:07Z,"U r Right palomino92 LOLz

,ptv83,2013-06-13T18:37Z,"Audio kicks in a second or two after the video starts ""America's war on drugs....""

and continues all the way throught he entirety of the video

the uploader is just a bot and will never ever read this, but downloaders have been warned, perhaps a superbay (forum) member can ask to have this nuked"
