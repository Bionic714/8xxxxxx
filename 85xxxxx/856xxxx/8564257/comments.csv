,oquatanginwann,2013-06-12T07:51Z,"If you use this TeamViewer to connect to many different computers, such as someone who provides  remote technical support, TeamViewer corporate will eventually catch on, and then give you the dreaded ""Commercial Use Suspected"" error message.

Even with that enclosed patch, TeamViewer company will catch on if you connect to too many different computers.

If you are only connecting to a small number of computers, and then only those same computers, you can use TeamViewer free dition, as well."
