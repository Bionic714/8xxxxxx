Well it would seem that it is going to take a day or two before the word gets out that there are 4 more RAR Archives seeding now in this collection.  All track are new to the system and many are from monthly hits discs issued since the last Part 23 was seeded.

Please see the enclosed text file with each RAR achive for the track lists which are too large to post here.

Single RAR Archive MP3+CDG files + track listing text file, all correctly tagged for playback from a PC.  Note if you want to change the MP3 tags to that of the file name there are a load of FREE software items on this site which will do this for you, but best bet is to import the files here into the professional playout software of your choice.   We use Ots DJ Pro for karaoke and music video playback.
