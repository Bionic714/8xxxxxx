The Buy Side, by former Galleon Group trader Turney Duff, portrays an after-hours Wall Street culture where drugs and sex are rampant and billions in trading commissions flow to those who dangle the most enticements. A remarkable writing debut, filled with indelible moments, The Buy Side shows as no book ever has the rewards ΓÇô and dizzying temptations ΓÇô of making a living on the Street.

Growing up in the 1980ΓÇÖs Turney Duff was your average kid from Kennebunk, Maine, eager to expand his horizons. After trying ΓÇô and failing ΓÇô to land a job as a journalist, he secured a trainee position at Morgan Stanley and got his first feel for the pecking order that exists in the trading pits. Those on the ΓÇ£buy side,ΓÇ¥ the traders who make large bets on whether a stock will rise or fall, are the ΓÇ£alphasΓÇ¥ and those on the ΓÇ£sell side,ΓÇ¥ the brokers who handle their business, are eager to please.
