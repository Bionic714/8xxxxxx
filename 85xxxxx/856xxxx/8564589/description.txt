One would think that with Jen LancasterΓÇÖs impressive list of bestselling self-improvement memoirsΓÇöBitter Is the New Black; Bright Lights, Big Ass; Such a Pretty Fat; Pretty in Plaid; My Fair Lazy; and Jeneration XΓÇöthat she would have it all together by now.

One would be wrong.

JenΓÇÖs still a little rough around the edges. Suffice it to say, sheΓÇÖs no Martha Stewart. And that is exactly why Jen is going to Martha up and live her life according to the advice of AmericaΓÇÖs overachieving older sisterΓÇöthe woman who turns lemons into lavender-infused lemonade.

By immersing herself in MarthaΓÇÖs media empire, Jen will embark on a yearlong quest to take herself, her house, her husband (and maybe even her pets) to the next levelΓÇöfrom closet organization to craft making, from party planning to kitchen prep.
