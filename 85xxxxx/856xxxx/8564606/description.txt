TITLE: 
Britain's Wicca Man

DESCRIPTION: 
The extraordinary story of Britain's fastest-growing religious group - the modern pagan witchcraft of Wicca - and of its creator, an eccentric Englishman called Gerald Gardner.

Historian and leading expert in Pagan studies Professor Ronald Hutton explores Gardner's story and experiences first-hand Wicca's growing influence throughout Britain today.

Born of a nudist colony in 1930s Dorset, Wicca rapidly grew from a small New Forest coven to a worldwide religion in the space of just 70 years.

It's a journey that takes in tales of naked witches casting spells to ward off Hitler, tabloid hysteria about human sacrifices and Gerald Gardner himself appearing on Panorama.

ADDITIONAL NOTES: 
This version was broadcast on the Australian network ABC, as part of a regular programme called "Compass". It was edited to fit that programme's schedule, and is therefore not the full documentary, which as of 11 June 2013 is unavailable.
