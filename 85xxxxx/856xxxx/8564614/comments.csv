I have found so many amazing groups I never heard of before until I found this torrent.  I respect whatever choice you make, but I certainly vote that you keep 'em coming!!!"

,clvnst,2013-06-13T04:28Z,TT as all ways you deliver another great torrent. I would love to see the new Martin Smith (Gods great Dance Floor). As far a encouragement goes my friend.... The simple fact that I can tell that you desire most to glorify God above all else is a beautiful thing. I would also love to hear about what God is doing in your life if you can say. I know this is a stretch but if ya want to talk about it I made a email clvnst7@gmail.com. If you dnt want to send anything I totally understand but I'm just throwing this out there. Ill pray for ya friend.

Since downloading your torrents my family and I have been truly blessed with music we can all enjoy and listen to and not having to worrying about censoring any language or content. If you decide to ends your music sharing then I hope the best for you and that you're next venture is much more exciting and fulfilling. Even though we'd love to see you continue and share more, don't let us hold you back from what God may be calling you to do. Besides, you've torrented enough for us for a lifetime, lol."

I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your musical bundles, like everyone else, I got to know new artist and musicians that honor and glorify the Almighty. God bless and may you be guided by the Holy Spirit in your life. Thanks again from a fellow pirate :] To God be the Glory always and for Eternity!! "
