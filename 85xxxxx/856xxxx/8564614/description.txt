2013 - THE YEAR IN CHRISTIAN MUSIC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have downloaded any of this Christian music from me in the past, and haven't yet introduced yourself, I would appreciate it if you took a quick moment to say "hi" in this thread today.

I've been faithfully sharing these "The Year In Christian Music" bundles since back in 2011.  For me, that means searching out and collecting anything current, Christian related of course, from Worship to Screamo.  From Alternative to Gospel.  From Reggae to Rap.  Most of which I will never personally listen to, but happily archive so I can include them in these bundles for others to enjoy.

And aside from the bundles themselves, I've also been torrenting here on The Pirate Bay since 2009.  And elsewhere online for much longer than that.

My collection has grown so large that I recently had to build a secondary desktop computer with three individual internal 3 terabyte drives, just so that I could continue onward with this ministry.  I haven't yet migrated over to the new desktop, but will need to shortly as I don't have a lot of faith in my external backup drives.

All of that to say I've been struggling with the direction I feel God wants me to take.  Sure I know this music is appreciated.  So long as God is glorified, nothing else matters.  Amen?  But I could use a little encouragement.  So if you've not yet said "hi", please consider doing so in this thread today.  And if you would sooner remain anonymous, I can certainty appreciate that too.  Please pray for that direction for me.

Now, on to the bundle itself.  There are lots of tasty morsels of music in this one.  Audio Adrenaline, Greater Allen Cathedral, One Republic, Starflyer 59, Switchfoot, Vineyard, etc.  There's sure to be something for everyone.

And as always, for those keeping count, we're now up to 513 releases for 2013.
