Ich bin nicht zum Wald aber.... the jesuits were never like that, they are in fact the intellectuals of the catholic church, leading universities and such as rectors, I admire them and love arguing with them since they are very knowledgeable, the ideal sparrings for an atheist like me....

Well, I've done quite a lot of research, and was a Jesuit novice, and this sort of stuff is unhistorical hysteria.

I'm surprised that the OP, who seems to be a Christian, is happy to spread such tawdry lies.

Can we expect uploads on the Protocols of Zion, Area 51 and how the moon landings were all faked soon?"
,dietrichzumwald,2013-06-12T14:50Z,"I read how to win every argument (ridicule your opponent in an attempt to steer people from the actual message)

Martin Luther and the various other reformers would disagree with your assessment, as well as all those millions of Christians who were burned at the stake in the town square publicly

Be that as it may, these came from a Jesuit source, Eric Jon Phelps a known Jesuit agitator who advocates violence in the name of Christ

They were included on his Vatican Assassins II CD

Third, I allow the reader to draw their own conclusions rather than attempt to sway them toward my way of thinking, you should try it yourself sometime

The download is here for those who want it, and even for those who will probably never even bother to take the time to read it, as most people do not read books these days, they get their history and news from CNN

Enjoy!"

============

Well, Luther split with the Roman Catholic church some twenty years before the Society of Jesus was founded, so I don't know what he has to do with it.


Millions of Christians burned at the stake.

Where do you get your history from?

If you honestly are trying to live your life in the love of Christ then you should take a hard look at yourself.

Spreading lies is not helping to bring the Kingdom of God any closer.

As attested to by Alberto Rivera the ex-jesuit priest, as well as others who have come from within the order to find salvation in Christ

,dietrichzumwald,2013-06-12T19:19Z,"One might also note: The Reformation is still thriving today, it did not go away or end

There are many Protestants who are still protesting and still see the flaws within the church from the time when Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the church nearly 500 years ago in 1521

They refer to it as Rekindling The Reformation

There are Protestants who still protest for the very same reasons which Martin Luther nailed to the door of the church in his Ninety-Five Theses, in 1521

They refer to it as Rekindling The Reformation, therefore it must still exist!

No, he really, really didn't.

If you are prepared to say that, either you have made no effort to inform yourself properly, or you have chosen to say something you know is not true.

The original companions and Ignatius agreed to form a 'company' to go to Jerusalem and to work for the conversion of the 'infidels' (Moslems)

When it became clear that this would not be possible, they settled in Rome, and put themselves at the service of the Pope.

They worked with the poor, and with 'fallen' women, preached and offered spiritual direction.

Subsequently, some of the early companions would served as theologians at the Council of Trent.

Rather than believing 'what I want to', I prefer, where there are facts available, to go by them.

I recommend you try it sometime."
