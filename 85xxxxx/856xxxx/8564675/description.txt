There are 13 suppressed (supposedly rare) books about Popery, Roman Catholicism, and the Jesuits and their order's obsession with world domination through the universal phalse church of Roam-an Catholicism.

They have not only been fingered by the reformers as the antichristic order but, even by their own people, nuns and priests from within as you will see both containe and revealed within the pages of these books.


and all the world wondered after the beast - Rev 13:3


Eric Jon Phelps provided these books in Vatican Assassins however, Eric Jon Phelps is likely a Jesuit agitator himself since he advocates violence in the name of Christ.

May the knowledge contained within these books guide you to the true word of God the Holy Bible and may Jesus be a lamp unto your feet!

Enjoy!
