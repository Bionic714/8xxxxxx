This is the first release of SMOS linux distro v1.0, based on linux Debian and BAMT linux. We have used BAMT linux to make the best operating system for scrypt mining. We have already fixed more than 10 bugs which exist on BAMT linux, and have also optimized this linux for scrypt miners. Lets begin with SMOS linux installation.
