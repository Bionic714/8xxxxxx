Award-winning four-part miniseries.

Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones star as fun-loving Gus McCrae and taciturn Woodrow Call, respectively, a pair of longtime friends and former Texas Rangers who crave one last adventure before they bow to their advancing years. Convinced that animals will thrive on the lush grasslands of Montana, Woodrow persuades Gus to undertake the arduous, 3000-mile cattle drive there.
