Tuesday 06-11-2013: Mo Ibrahim - Chairman of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation

Shaun Ley speaks to Mo Ibrahim, creator of the Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership. His Index of African Governance suggests generally things are getting better. But some worry that China's willingness to lend money 'no strings attached' is encouraging politicians to revert to their bad old ways. Is Mo Ibrahim's ambition of better governance being undermined from outside?
