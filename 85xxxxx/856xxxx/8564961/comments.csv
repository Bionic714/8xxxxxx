6.2"
,BostonAl2012,2013-06-13T07:35Z,"Same Director as Midnight Meat Train, which is supposed to rock, but this is much weaker, per the review with poor acting and poor dialog?  

I always thought, the acting falls directly on the director~retake it until its right...  Hitchcock said there are no bad actors only bad directors, I believe him...

movie gets a 6.2 because the directing is only worth that, poor budget doesn't effect the pure acting...  

Great upload none the less and I'm still watching, and seeding while I do.  :)  Thanks .Bone.    "
