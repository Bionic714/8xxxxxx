Bread and Beer Band
Unreleased Studio Tracks
1969


According to the book "Rocket Man- Elton John From A-Z" the Bread and Beer Band was a group of England's best studio musicians, formed by Tony King (a record producer and assistant at Apple Records). The band included Tony King, Bernie Calvert of the Hollies, Roger Pope and Caleb Quaye of Hookfoot (and Elton John's late 70's band), Jamaican percussionists Lennox Jackson and Rolfo, and Reg Dwight (later known as Elton John). This instrumental album was recorded during sessions in 1968 and 1969 and included Chris Thomas as a producer. This album was never released and featured psychedelic jazz interpretations of earlier hits. Elton John played harpsichord on "If I Were a Carpenter" and electric and acoustic piano on the other tracks. As I previously noted, this album was never released (although a couple of tracks from these sessions were, but aren't included here) and Tony King gave the master tapes to Elton as a 1976 birthday gift.
