Performance improvements and fixes

Changes compared to original Skype:
- Exit button (kills app & service)
- Minor fixes here and there (vibration, chat, video-calls)
- Speaker toggle while in call (just press your phone's MENU button)
- Bluetooth audio toggle while in call (just press your phone's MENU button), uses *my* code for BT Audio, so you can try it for mono headsets or headsets that don't work with Skype's original BT support
- Camera LED/flash support while in video-call (just press your phone's MENU button)
- Advanced Settings:
- Sign-in status picker, allows you to pick your desired status (availability), which will be applied automatically just after logging-in.
- Keep screen alive, disables proximity sensor for calls
- Force-enable video-calling, for phones that can't get video-calling enabled.
*Video-calling needs compatible CPU (ARMv7). If your phone's CPU is not compatible, Skype will keep crashing/looping at login!*
- Force enable camera rotation, will attempt to enable camera rotate option (under the camera selection popup)
- Avoid setFPS, for some users that get black image in video-calls
- Use valid preview surface, for some users that get black image in video-calls (a bit buggy at the moment, but better than nothing )
- Force notification LED/BLN, for users that "Pulse notification light" option (in Skype original settings) doesn't actually enable notification LEDs or BLN!
- Advanced camera settings (resolution/focus/scene/white balance/color effect)
- Ringtone picker!
- Notification sound picker!
- Notifications' vibration pattern picker!
- Disable vibration entirely
- Disable sign-in/out vibration and/or sounds
- Auto speaker on
- Tablet UI orientation unlock (no more forced landscape - still a dirty hack)

Skype 3.2.0.6673 modded (build v19.1) !
Changelog:
~ Tablet UI orientation unlock
~ In-chat text-box resizes for a better view of the text you're typing
