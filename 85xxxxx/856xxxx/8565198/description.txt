Burger Bash

This week Food Network Star is throwing its very own Burger Bash, an over-the-top burger competition. The remaining finalists are tasked with creating the best burger of their lives and presenting it to 100 burger enthusiasts. After the presentations, the burger fans must decide whose burger they want to try based on their live-demo presentation. After a vote on which burger has the best flavor, the least successful finalist is sent home.
