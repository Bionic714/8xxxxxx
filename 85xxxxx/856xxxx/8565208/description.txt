Plot

Demi, a journeyman Soviet Navy captain finishing up a career that failed to live up to the legacy of his legendary father, is given an assignment by Markov to lead a top secret mission and given the command of his old ship. Due to mistakes he made during his service, involving the deaths of many of his past crew in a fire, this will be his last assignment and his only opportunity to command any ship at all. Demi interrupts a party involving his crew, including Alex Kozlov, his up-and-coming executive officer headed for great success. However, as Demi leaves his home to lead Alex and the crew of a Soviet submarine given a shadowy mission, the presence of KGB agent Bruni and ominous portents begin to alter the objectives of the mission, concerning Demi and Kozlov.

Demi and Kozlov are wary of Bruni and his men and soon discover his mission: to use a device known as the Phantom to alter their ship's identifying marks to make them appear as civilian merchants, or a number of other ships. After a demonstration, Demi questions Bruni about the device and the mission objectives and not long after, Bruni's men hold Demi at gunpoint. Bruni informs Demi that his plans are to start a war between the United States and China by disguising the ship as a Chinese vessel and launching a nuclear missile at the American fleet. Those loyal to Demi are taken with him and locked away in the ship, where Demi explains his past failures and explains how him smacking his head on the ship wall gave him seizures and brain trauma.
