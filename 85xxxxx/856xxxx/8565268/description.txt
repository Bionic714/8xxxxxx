A new bride (Régine Bourgeois) is ignored by her husband on their wedding night, but then initiated into all kinds of debauchery with the help of other men and two other women (Christine Leval, Valérie Seller). This begins with the bride, in black stocking and black veil lying in a hammock while one of seven candles is lit and another girl has sex on the floor. One candle is lit and one 'outrage' per day is committed until all seven candles are lit, the new bride gradually joining in.
