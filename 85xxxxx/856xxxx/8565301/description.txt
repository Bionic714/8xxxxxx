In this 3D platformer, help Zack Zero to save his beloved Marlene, captured by the evil Zulrog as part of an evil plan to exchange her for the kelestinia, a unique material with the power to travel in time. Travel to Zulrog's world and cross the wild territories of the planet's surface, entering the dangerous and well-defended enemy base, exploring the dark and mysterious caverns, discovering the lava caves and their primitive inhabitants, creeping into the prison where Marlene is held captive, and finally making every effort to stop Zulog as he hatches his evil plans. The power of fire, ice and stone at your disposal, as the nanotechnology of Zack's suit grants you special powers which will make you almost invincible. Cover your enemies in flames, freeze time in order to avoid mortal traps or convert your fist into stone and knock down formidable obstacles!
