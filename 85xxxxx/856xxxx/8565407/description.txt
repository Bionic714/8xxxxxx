Rated R for strong aberrant sexuality, graphic nudity, bloody violence and pervasive language
Shiloh Fernandez, Noah Segan, Candice Accola

While partying in / trashing an old abandoned asylum, two high schoolers (Rickie and JT - Shiloh and Noah) discover something sealed away in the basement: a naked woman strapped to a table who is alive but appears to be brain dead. Rickie wants to leave immediately and tell someone, but JT suggests they "keep" her, saying that they can "get some" whenever they want with her here. Eventually JT discovers that she cannot die, no matter what he does to her, though Rickie wants no part in this. Over the weeks, friendship, integrity, and sanity are tested as the two try to keep the secret and cover up betrayals.

This movie is quite twisted...no, make that extremely twisted. It constantly asks the question of "would you do this if you could get away with it?"
