thanks for the upload"
,bdivines,2013-06-15T19:55Z,"@aldwin123: You use some player like VLC
Normally other media players should also be able to pick up subtitles, but for that the Subtitles would have to be the exact same name as the video file.

Example: Episode_1.avi should have Episode_1.srt :)"
