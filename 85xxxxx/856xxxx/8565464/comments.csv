,hhavok,2013-06-15T01:12Z,"Not sure how is this movie classified as a horror. It's not a horror, not even close. It's all about people dying, rather violently, but still, there is nothing scary in it.

The audio is average. It was real hard to understand what they were saying when there was something in the background.
You might want to download subtitles (I did not find any working english ones though).

But if you're looking for a horror, look for something else."

DON'T CLICK ON ANY LINKS from people (trolls/spammers) which you don't have a clue about.You'll end up heavy infected and probably in need to reformate.
We try to delete thoose (24/7) as soon we get reports or spot them.

Have a nice day/evening people and please don't ignore what i've said above."
