,whatabout81,2013-06-12T12:50Z,"how the fuck do your torrents not work? download as an avi file yet every thing i try and play it on says ""unsupported data"""
,Aimless29,2013-06-12T14:58Z,Thank you!  Much appreciated.
,RainyDayMan,2013-06-12T17:58Z,"I registered just to confirm that there is something unusual about your torrents - at least from my end.  You upload some very unique shows, so the other day I downloaded several.  None of them play on my PS3.  They all come up as unsupported.  I tried a remux to an mp4 container which didn't work.  I tried a remux which converted the audio to AAC and that didn't work.  The only way I can get your files to play on PS3 is a complete reencoding.  Not trying to be a jerk, just thought you might want to know in case it's an easy fix.  I appreciate your efforts."
,mkgninja,2013-06-12T19:51Z,All of the torrents play for me.  I'm using a desktop PC.  I can play them in Windows Media and VLC.  
,SARmedic,2013-06-12T19:56Z,Works fine with VLC and my Western Digital media player.
,vw_higgins,2013-06-12T22:58Z,works for me as well....
,linze143,2013-06-12T23:34Z,thank you as always!  works fine for me too in VLC
,dpworkle,2013-06-14T19:09Z,"@whatabout81 Why so confrontational, especially when it seems that the problem may be on the client side? I never have a problem with any of these much-wanted downloads. Thanks to verovenio and the Scene"
[V],verovenlo,2013-06-15T18:29Z,all torrents i upload are checked before uploading so that means they all played fine on my pc
