I had one of the large format reprints that DC did back in the 70s, I remember the cover was WW #1 but don't recall if there were other issues included besides the first. Anyway, I've had many favorite comic characters over the years, but she was my first. Thanks!!! "
,muckymucks,2013-06-12T09:55Z,"This should be interesting. I'm embarrassed to say I haven't read much of the Golden Age. I've only gleaned off some of the more popular stuff shown in comic documentaries and articles about the era. It'll be nice to see this stuff page by page. 

Thanks for the upload!"
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-12T10:04Z,"...Yeah, the GL torrent has been popular, as it's been perpetually seeding since I first finished the download. Been reluctant to take it down as a result, so I figure I'll leave it up for at least the rest of the month. Might wind up doing the same with this WW torrent, depending on the demand. Good work again, Mothra!"

,BrezNJ,2013-06-12T14:00Z,"Thanks, Mothra67. Another great upload. Just read 1 of the issues that has come thru. Good, but for Golden Age, I still prefer Batman or the DC anthology titles. Thanks again."
,Mothra67,2013-06-12T16:49Z,Glad you all enjoy it!
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-13T08:15Z,"...Anyone have problems getting this seed finishing? May have been on my end, so I'm redownloading and will seed if successful."
