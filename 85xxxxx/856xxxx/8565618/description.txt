**DESCRIPTION**

If you have a complicated project to work on or a twisted topic to teach, MindManager helps you break down the big problem into its details. The main topic is placed in the center of the mindmap, while your ideas are placed on branches that radiate from this focus. You can drag and drop branches to reorganize your ideas quickly, and MindManager automatically reformats your map as you work.
