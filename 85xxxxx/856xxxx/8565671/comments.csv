She asked her listeners to punch supporters of President Obama in the face.  Oh, like anyone would have supported a President Romney ??  Get real, Andrea. You're as phony as Limbaugh, Hannity, Beck, and other conversative freaks who constantly bash the current administration and the President.

Oh, and the surveillance on American citizens has been going on since after 9-11-2001 when the Patriot Act was overwhelmingly supported by President Bush and passed by his Congress!

I'm not happy about some things that President Obama has done (and the Republicans in Congress has prevented him from doing....like creating JOBS) but he's still a hell of a lot better than Bush. And during the 6 weeks the Democrats had control of the Senate as well as the Pelosi House some important bills were passed. Unfortunately a lot of good things died in the Senate due to fillibustering....then and now."
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-06-12T09:33Z,...what a stupid stupid comment....the patriot act was in the hands of cheney and bush ...conservatives although although acquiescent to democrats to often.... and we thwarted 12 attacks world wide post 9-11...no successes...thanks to cheney's network....then we handed the patriot act over the most far left candidate in american history whose abuses are only now surfacing....and whose administration is staffed with only 8% of people from the real world...all others are pro-islam pro-communist ideologues who look at our constitution as an obstacle and people who are patriotic and know the constitution as the enemy...and you blithering moron the democrats took over every square inch of washington except the oval office in november 2006....2006.!!...and held both houses till the election in november 2010....there was a uprising of surprising power called the tea party that arose from nothing to a force SOLELY due to obama's daily assault on our culture...our legal system..our social system...and military.....they did not field their own candidates but rather put up conservative republicans and took over 50 seats from the socialist democrats and i believe about 10 governor seats......the senate has been in socialist democrat hands for over 6 years with a huge majority 59 to 41 for most of it...not 6 weeks....the republicans only have the filibuster as their only tool.....and the dems tried to rewrite that too.....pelosi was speaker for 4 full years.....not 6 weeks........this is the the worst president in american history and it's not because he's incompetent ...it's deliberate......his speeches can lay over the top of castro's almost identically.....he knows very little history....almost no science and tipped his hand about his false education when he admitted he was lost after algebra....you don't get into the schools he claimed without exceptional math skills....not just simple arithmetic....i speak first hand here...he is solely responsible for the dreadful economy because there is not one policy that would grow the economy.....he is nothing more than a hateful battering ram against everything that built the country and holds it together...there has never been a mistake like this...a man as president who truly hates the country..it's people...and it's history...obamacare will cripple the nation....and the new dream act will kill it....and you supoort all this thru your ignorance....there couldn't have been a better man to undo all of obama's damage than romney...but romney was too nice...too formal...and too polite....and ran a campaign that was based on running against a democrat instead of who and what obama truly is....hopefully his anti-costitutional scandals will keep unraveling and he will be finished and the country will have a president biden....oh and by the way since facts and data would never enter your rantings about what the dems could have done....remember they had 4 years...fully 4 years and did nothing but increase the debt.....double the food stamps...quadruple the unemployment time....all the while pushing the country closer to collapse...which is his goal....he has the authority to suspend the constitution if we have a collapse...which is his dream.....financial collapse and militarily disarmed...he has removed our top 4 generals....their commonality was they would never breach posse comitatus...ever...their replacements will....probably your dream too.....a police state is all leftist's dreams.....and tantaros is not what you would call a sexy model type...she's a plain jane....who's quite bright and witty...........someone like laura ingraham probably talks way over your level too....laura is pretty to my tastes but it's her manner and her mind that make her beautiful....michele malkin is another whom you'd hate....pleasant looking but not a sexy model type who is where she is because of what she's written and because she won't back down....i just went to your pages ...stick to your abbott and costello....it doesn't require thinking...which would be good for you....notice i respond to your unwelcome
