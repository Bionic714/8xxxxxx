Just a Pilgrim description:

Another work by Garth Ennis and Carlos Ezquerra, set in a postapocalyptic world where a sunerruption (Refered to as 'The Burn') cooked the oceans into gigantic deserts, and killed most of the planets population.

The series is set some years after 'The Burn' and narrated by the diary of a child named 'Billy'. It follows a small group of surviors who are travelling the desert once called the Atlantic Basin, on their search for water. It chronicles their meeting with a lone extremely religious wanderer who calls himself 'Pilgrim' as well as a group of pirates, led by a man with no eyes, two hooks for hands and two peg legs.
