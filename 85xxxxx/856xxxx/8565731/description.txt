This is Final Fantasy Origins for the PSX. It contains Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II on one disc. It is a remake of the orignal Final Fantasy for the NEs and Final Fantasy II for the Famicon (Japanese NES)never released in the US. It contains enhanced graphics, sound and music, plus added extra features, but still the same great story and classic game play for nostalgic fans. Enjoy!
