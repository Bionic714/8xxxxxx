,tekknolag,2013-06-12T16:06Z,"Actually, zelos81, they're not fake. I did a direct rip of the CD, with zero conversion. The CD had AIFF music files."
,tekknolag,2013-06-12T16:07Z,"In addition, Spectro is ""currently capable of reading FLAC, APE, MP3 and WAV files""... and these aren't any of those formats."

This makes for 1.35 Mbit/sec bitrate."
,blackcleric,2013-06-12T20:38Z,"soo fake, y/n?"
,MiscFoxes,2013-06-13T03:24Z,It isn't fake. Very nice quality on the rips. 
,dansmutboy,2013-06-16T04:36Z,Why use AIFF instead of FLAC?
,dansmutboy,2013-06-16T04:37Z,"Well, it's still lossless, so thanks."
