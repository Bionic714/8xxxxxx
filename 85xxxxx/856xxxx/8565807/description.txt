Tom Stall is a loving family man and well-respected citizen of a small Indiana town. 

But when two savage criminals show up at his diner, Tom is forced to take action and thwart the robbery attempt. 

Suddenly heralded as a hero who took the courage to stand up to crime, people look up to Tom as a man of high moral regard.
 
But all that media attention has the likes of mobsters showing up at his doorstep, 
charging that Tom is someone else for whom they've been looking.
 
Is it a case of mistaken identity, or does Tom have a history that no one knows about? 

Either way, someone's about to find out if there's a history of violence.
