The .mp3 file of this torrent is working. Try to delete everything, including the torrent, and add the torrent again to download it. It should work.

BTW, great suggestions! I think it's all we need for now. Just the Status Q&A video he has already provided. Take a look at the source in the torrent's .txt file."
