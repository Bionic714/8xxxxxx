Storyline: Drama based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, who worked as an assistant on the set of 'The Prince and the Showgirl', the 1956 British-made film starring Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe. Monroe (Michelle Williams) has recently married playwright Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), and filming coincides with their British honeymoon. But when Miller is called away to Paris on business, 23-year-old Colin (Eddie Redmayne), assistant to the irascible Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), sees his opportunity and offers to escort the star on a short break in the English countryside. As she adapts to country life and relaxes from the pressures of her celebrity and her work, Monroe recounts her remarkable story and reveals the fragile foundation of contradictions and insecurities on which her stardom is built.
