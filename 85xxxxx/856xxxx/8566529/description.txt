Recently upgraded to "Super Galaxy" status, this heavy-lifting aircraft can fly non-stop to virtually anywhere in the world, delivering cargo too large and too urgent to be shipped any other way. Follow along with the U.S. Air Force onboard this mighty plane on a marathon mission to Bagram, Afghanistan, a 14-hour, 6,200-mile journey requiring dangerous mid-air refueling and a perilous landing in the heart of enemy territory.
