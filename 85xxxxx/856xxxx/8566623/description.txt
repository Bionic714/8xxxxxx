Bizarre is a self-described "alternative"
and "non-mainstream" magazine. It is a sister publication
to Fortean Times. It has no connection to the fetish
publication also known as "Bizarre" published between 
1946-1959. The magazine has a wide variety of features and 
articles which include unusual news events from around the
world, drug usage, different types of fetishistic and
deviant behavior, interviews with famous counterculture 
figures and showcases of cult directors, musicians and authors.

Bizarre has also covered legislation regarding sex offences
and civil liberties, along with issues like censorship
and human rights abuses, both domestically and abroad. 
It has also started a campaign to raise awareness of prejudice 
towards subcultures following the murder of Sophie Lancaster.
From the start the publication had much in common with more
mainstream lad's mags, typically featuring a semi-nude model 
on the front cover, nude photography in special sealed 'x rated'
sections inside, and frequent reviews of weird gadgets, films,
music, and websites. They regularly cover art, gay culture,
the avant-garde and the Cinema of Transgression 
in their art and music reviews.
