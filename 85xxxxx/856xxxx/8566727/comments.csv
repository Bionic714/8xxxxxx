,vijaybalaji,2013-06-13T10:23Z,thank you roonie for making this awesome game in small size!! THANK YOU
,vijaybalaji,2013-06-13T10:31Z,"whether it is the real legendary edition or just an repack of all dlc? 

many people comments on walmart release (13.05gb) that its just an repack.. 

can you please confirm it."
[T],ronnie_88BOT,2013-06-13T12:47Z,this game has a legendary edition its not a repack. this is a repack using walmart's rip we have made this much much smaller than his which is about 13GB. reduced by around 5GB. we kept everything at 100% so no graphic or audio reductions :) cheers
,Spart4,2013-06-13T12:55Z,Seed please :D the download is really slow
[T],ronnie_88BOT,2013-06-13T14:45Z,73 downloads but only 8 are seeding. forgive me if the speed sucks. I can only seed so much. dont have rocket speed internet :D
,Treddy_bear,2013-06-14T13:12Z,"Got it installed, but when I open up the launcher the ""Data"" button is still greyed out. Does that mean the DLC didn't install right?"
,Treddy_bear,2013-06-14T13:23Z,"The game is installed, but in the launcher the ""data files"" button is still greyed out. Is the DLC on there? Normally, you activate which DLC packs you want through there. "
,prokia1939,2013-06-16T02:05Z,um...can i download mods in it ?...by using nexus manager?..
[T],ronnie_88BOT,2013-06-16T11:49Z,"@Treddy, you are the only one having the problem. maybe reinstall. we have tested this game and it works fine. sorry m8 cant help u. :S
@prokia, have no idea what u are asking, srry"
[T],ronnie_88BOT,2013-06-16T13:12Z,"Took a while to download, but it installed fine. After starting it up, I noticed the ""Data Files"" option was greyed out. I had to edit the ""SkyrimPrefs.ini"" file located in ""DocumentsMy GamesSkyrim"". Scroll to the section [Launcher] and add the line ""bEnableFileSelection=1"" without quotations. Now you should be able to click ""Data Files"" and turn them all on. 
I played for about an hour with no problems. 
It is v1.9.32.0.8, but I haven't confirmed if the DLC is working. I haven't gotten that far yet lol. So far so good.
***someone elses comment to those having the greyed out issue***"
,prokia1939,2013-06-16T14:51Z,skyrim mods ~~
,adammang,2013-06-17T03:36Z,"The trolling is strong with whoever uploaded this. This is not Skyrim Legendary Edition.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT. 

Already @ level 11 NONE of the DLC's have kicked in. "
