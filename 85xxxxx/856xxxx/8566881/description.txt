James May's Man Lab Series 3
The complete third series of the documentary show in which James May contrasts modern practical skills with those of years gone by. In this series, James builds a pizza oven, makes soap, broadcasts pirate radio and much more.


1)  The Grand National 
James May continues his epic quest to re-skill the modern male. In the opening episode James enlists the help of a memory champion as he prepares to commentate live on one of the toughest sporting events of them all - the Grand National. Back in the Man Lab, rather than order in some takeaway, James builds a one tonne pizza oven from scratch. Meanwhile his helpless sidekick Rory is set the challenge of convincing a group of experts that he is the BBC's newest wine expert, with James and Oz Clark offering help via an earpiece from a van parked outside.

2)  Bunned Aid 
James travels to an Oxfordshire town where a royal tradition desperately needs his help. Can he find a way of feeding thousands of locals to save their diamond jubilee celebration using ballistics and hot crossed buns? Man Lab also tests once and for all whether it is possible to make your own luck by beating the odds. To put it to the test, James challenges Sim to the most dramatic drinking game you will ever see. All this and there is still time for James and the team to build a water clock and create a coat that doubles up as a bed.

3)  How to Find Lost Things 
James digs up half of the South Coast to try and find the wedding ring his father lost on a family holiday forty years ago. Man Lab sets sail and goes live with its very own pirate radio station. Meanwhile back at headquarters, James and Sim solve the time old problem of how to deal with junk mail using a model railway and some precision engineering. This time the invention of the week is an ingenious device that guarantees you will never spill a pint ever again.

4)  How Capture Lightning 
James and the team set off chasing storms across the country as they attempt to take on the wrath of Mother Nature and actually catch a bolt of lightning. Also in the show, James finally thinks he has found a sport he can compete in when he enters the Rock Paper Scissors World Championships. He also attempts to bring down Britain's crime figures by creating a neighbourhood watch team made up entirely of cats and there's still time for James to make a bar of soap for Sim's filthy and neglected hands which involves some dangerous chemistry and a trip to the local Welsh coal mine.

5)  How to Run Whelk Stall 
James May attempts Man Lab's most secretive and risky stunt to date, which involves an ailing seaside town and a great big monster. Also, James challenges his hapless sidekick Rory to the unenviable task of running a whelk stall, a new type of table football is invented for every England fan, and a cup of tea will never be wasted again with the amazing Cup of Tea Alarm.
