Description:
For a week the world watched and waited as an unstoppable plague swept America. As the devastation spread, a cult was born. Calling themselves the Faithful, they preached the coming of the plague and foretold the demise of mankind. They offered absolution in the name of the Brood - 'Embrace the true faith or suffer damnation'.

With your team of eight covert operatives you must strike into the heart of the Faithful and destroy the insane cultists before they can spread the plague across the globe. Are you ready for an all out war against the mutated nightmare army of the Brood?
