,kalotiani,2013-06-12T16:29Z,Is this copy any good please?
,SteelerJ17,2013-06-12T17:58Z,It's the same as the others!!!
,ScottyD7421,2013-06-12T19:06Z,"LOL @ SteelerJ17, you've left pretty much the same comments on a number of Fast and Furious 6 torrents yet the screens on this file look 100% on any other so far.

Am downloading now and will report back with A/V as soon as it's finished.

Cheers"
,KevinCostner,2013-06-12T21:11Z,Looks like the same shaky video to me.  You can also see people get up in front of the screen.
,SteelerJ17,2013-06-12T21:34Z,Can somebody put up a decent copy? I'm hoping for a R6 at least. 
,SteelerJ17,2013-06-12T21:57Z,"@ScottyD7421 Watch. You're going to say I'm right! 

Cheers"

V/8
A/8

The picture and audio are pretty good remembering this is not dvd, there is a bit of audience movement, some minor blurring and a fair bit of camera movement, especially 1:28:35 where the camera has an epileptic fit :-), but overall it's definitely watch-able. 

@SteelerJ17, dude, i get what u r saying but the clearness of both picture and audio shits on the earlier releases :-) "
,KevinCostner,2013-06-13T03:52Z,Scotty are you grading on a curve?  No way this is even close to an 8.
,SlimShadySCK,2013-06-13T04:04Z,@ScottyDoucheNozzle Really?  8 & 8? Are you that pathetic that you have to lie about the quality of the movie to make your self look good? Hahaha you make me laugh you loser!
,ScottyD7421,2013-06-13T06:15Z,"@SlimShadySCK, it's always sad to see someone resign themselves to name calling to get their point across.

1. as cams go this one is pretty good, yes the picture moves every now and then but as far as clarity/picture quality goes it's pretty good and so yes i would give it an 8. Same goes for audio.

2. not really sure how lying about quality would make myself look good but i suppose that's the best you have so ummmmm yeah i guess you really showed me.

3. there is no universal rating system, i know people such as yourself probably want 1-4 for cams and 5-7 for dvd and 8-10 for blu-ray but in reality it just wont work. I mean would you rate 8 for a really crap distorted blu-ray copy or would you give it a 4? I rate based on the individual file this one being a Cam (TS) and if you don't like that don't pay attention to my comments, i fail to see the purpose of attacking an individual just because you don't agree with them?"
,jekyll2112,2013-06-13T08:53Z,"i really hate when people bitch about free shit, but damn, seriously..? this might be the best cam i've ever watched if not for the squirming ass camera man. sit still dickhead."
,eternal6969,2013-06-15T10:12Z,"@SlimShadySCK are you stupid or something? ScottyD7421 merely said v8 a8, and he's pathetic for trying to make himself look good, ok dombass, i'm gonna break it down for you in stupid people terms, he would be pathetic for trying to make himself look good if this was his torrent to try and make it look good and whatnot to get more seeds, downloads etc, how does xxxlavalxxx look like ScottyD7421? am I viewing correctly because i know those 2 names don't look alike at all, you'd have to be stupid to think they look alike, ooooh SlimShadySCK is a stupid fuck, well that makes sense, he's grading on a level of CAAAAAAAAMMMMM copy dombass, not Bluray, CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMM, slow enough for you?? you stupid fuck haha"
,HooK_43,2013-06-16T20:42Z,"you guys crack me up i cant believe some one come on tpb and bitches about cam quality, if you think it could be a 10 & 10 then i suggest you do it your self and if you dont want to do that then go pay to watch the fucking movie or wait till dvd or blu ray to come out no cam will match up tp either dvd or blu ray quality not even if you spend 30 hours of your life reconverting and enhancing the file i find it really pathetic for some one to bitch about free movies especialy if they are still in the theater i dont usualy down load cam because i like better quality on video and audio because i do reconvert them to higher bit rates and ect to burn on to dved or blu ray depending what people want that dont have the luxury of unlimited downloading as i do so people if you want to talk shit about bad quality on cam rips i sugesst to go talk to you toilet but because your mouth stinks


thanks for the uplaod keep up the good work i know all you guys do the best you can much appreciated "
