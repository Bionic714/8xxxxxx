This is a chapter from the excellent optics book "Seeing The Light"
(http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471603856), by Falk, Brill and Stork (Wiley, 1986)
It's a great resource for those starting to learn about the topic,
as it introduces the concepts very gently and in a layman-friendly manner.

Alas, I couldn't find any digital version online,
and I can't scan the whole book myself -- it's 450 pages long!
What I did, then, was scan the two chapters that I needed the most,
and thought it would be nice to at least make these two available for others.

This is the Holography chapter. It contains 6 sections:
 1) Introduction
 2) Transmission holograms
 3) Production of transmission holograms
 4) Applications of transmission holography
 5) White-light holograms
 6) Other methods of display holography
At the end it has a summary, followed by a list of problems.

I am providing the other chapter I scanned (Ch.12 - Wave Optics) as a separate torrent: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8566948
In that torrent's description, there is a step-by-step description of the process and tools I used to make these "e-bookchapters", in the hopes that it might be useful for others wanting to scan books for digital consumption. All the tools I used are free and open source software and can be found in the standard repositories of Ubuntu. The only difference between the processing of the two chapters is this chapter wasn't manually cleaned up for speckles and other noise, but it is still quite clean and readable, thanks to the powerful semi-automated processing pipeline provided by the ScanTailor tool.

Note: I tried to perform OCR so the text would be searchable and selectable, but the results were quite bad and I decided to use only the raw images instead.
