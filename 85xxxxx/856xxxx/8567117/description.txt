Richard Rawlings and Aaron Kaufmann deal in rusty gold. The proprietors of Gas Monkey Garage in Dallas buy and restore forgotten and fading away American cars, everything from 1931 Model A's to '73 Trans Ams, before selling them at auction. As "Fast N' Loud" documents, Rawlings is the mastermind, the deal-maker with an eye for the relics worth bringing back to life, and to find them the guys scour barns, swap meets and overgrown fields across Texas and surrounding states. The restorations are primarily managed by Kaufmann, a fabricator and self-taught mechanic whose sharp skills and design savvy first endeared him to Rawlings and kick-started their partnership.
