[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-12T20:25Z,"some might say ignorance is a waste of time, Birdman2can. CBR files are the standard digital comic book format. use CDisplayEX or one of the other popular free software programs to read them.

and by the way, thanks a ton for this gotg issue, GIANNIS511. appreciate you very much!"

[T],GIANNIS511,2013-06-13T00:36Z,"@Birdman2can: It might not be a difficult thing to upload comics on pirate bay, but it certainly takes valuable time and as a matter of fact more time than the one you spent downloading this torrent, so show some respect to the uploaders. If you don't know what a .cbr file is It's certainly not my fault, but yours. There is a search engine called google where you can find what cbr means and how to open it. Also you could ask politely how to open this kind o files, but apparently you chose to be a jerk and insult the person who gave you this comic for free. Politeness is a virtue that unfortunately you don't seem to have."
