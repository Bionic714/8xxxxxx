Then, they join Ghanshyam and his friends in a seemingly innocent game of hide and seek. But danger is lurking. The Evil Kalidutt wants to kill Ghanshyam, and he uses black magic to create thundering rain and swirling winds. The other children are frightened, but does Ghanshyam run away? What happens when, fearing the worst, Ghanshyam's father and the other villagers rush to the mango orchard looking for the children? The film ends with a memorable resolution that will delight children
