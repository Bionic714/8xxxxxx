The first part of an animation film series on the life of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, Ghanshyam and the Storm of Evil combines computer-generated animation, vivid images and a suspense-filled storyline to present Bhagwan Swaminarayan's birth and childhood for younger viewers.

The film starts in the tiny village of Chhapaiya in North India where this divine child was born on April 2, 1781. Viewers visit the celebration in which the great sage Markandeya named the child Ghanshyam due to his divinity. Then, they join Ghanshyam and his friends in a seemingly innocent game of hide and seek. But danger is lurking. The Evil Kalidutt wants to kill Ghanshyam, and he uses black magic to create thundering rain and swirling winds. The other children are frightened, but does Ghanshyam run away? What happens when, fearing the worst, Ghanshyam's father and the other villagers rush to the mango orchard looking for the children? The film ends with a memorable resolution that will delight children and adults alike.
