With his polished tenor vocals and natural affinity for creating shimmering, seductive melodies, singer-songwriter Seth Glier knows how to sway the sentiments of his listeners. Here, the album title alone is enough to catch oneΓÇÖs attention, but itΓÇÖs GlierΓÇÖs precise phrasing and subtle touches that make for an engaging start-to-finish listen. Whether heΓÇÖs singing solitary ballads like ΓÇ£Everything BeautifulΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£I Am Only as Loved as I Am OpenΓÇ¥ or tackling the more vigorous refrains that spark ΓÇ£Man I Used to BeΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Down to the Wire,ΓÇ¥ Glier draws emotional power from the slightest of suggestions. ThatΓÇÖs not to say this Massachusetts native is some brooding shoegazer. On the swampy-sounding ΓÇ£The Stars and GlitterΓÇ¥ and brassy ΓÇ£New World I See,ΓÇ¥ Glier livens up the proceedings with some welcome infusions of energy. Still, heΓÇÖs a master of nuance, and thatΓÇÖs ultimately what makes Things I Should Let You Know an album with so much to reveal. ΓÇôLee Zimmerman
