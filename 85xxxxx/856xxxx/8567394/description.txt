Travelers and art lovers will delight in this mix of art, history, biography, and travel guide that covers southern France and explores the teal skies, emerald hills, red soil, and indigo seas beloved by the artist. The journey begins in Paris and then moves to the fashionable port of St. Tropez, the fishing village of Collioure, chic and voluptuous Nice, and the rustic refuge of Vence, and ends in the luxurious resort of Cimiez. The author identifies the villas and studios where Matisse lived and worked in each location and discusses how his art responded to the palette and ambience of each local landscape.
