I still managed to get the shows up on our network by tethering my phone to my laptop.  So I am by no means ""slacking"".

TPB is not my top priority guys.  I've said it before.  I do this as an extra courtesy to people who haven't joined WDM yet.

The shows go up much earlier on WDM and then the torrents go up here last once I've served the WDM community.  But even when TPB is down we still offer the torrents hosted locally on WDM so TPB crashing doesn't effect seeding.

Tuesday TPB was down all day (for me at least) and didn't come back until just now (Wednesday @ noon).

If you join WDM you won't have to worry about TPB.  Just a suggestion.

Things are back to normal today.  6/12 show will be up in 30 mins"
,cekubal,2013-06-12T18:23Z,thanks for all your work.
[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-12T18:40Z,"No problem, dude. You don't have to explain yourself or upload The Howard Stern Show.

Neither does SternGeek, who is late with his copy of today's main show and Wrap-Up Show on his own site and Facebook page.  

Whoever is first is the one I download.  Keep up the good work!"
[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-12T18:50Z,"Ah, Sterngeek posted today's show on his You Tube channel so it's all good!  Both of you guys are doing a fine job, and we all appreciate your efforts!"
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-06-12T19:18Z,"Sterngeek gets the show from us.  I would think that was obvious with the WDM tags at the end on half his posts.  If the official WDM version is up in time he just hijacks the 32k version that one of our contributors posts on our site.

Unless you enjoy clicking 5 different ""ADFLY"" links just to get WDM releases an hour later I suggest you join WDM Network."
[V],wushdishmeen,2013-06-12T19:26Z,"I posted the 6/12 show already.  That's how he got it buddy.  Also I'd appreciate you not plugging people who hijack our content and post it on public sites that we didn't authorize. 

Essentially putting not just WDM but YOUR SOURCE for Stern at risk.  There is a reason our community is private.

If we wanted our files on copyright hell (YouTube) then we would post them there.  Idiots like SternGeek are drawing negative attention.

Just like people stealing our HTV rips and posting them on YouTube so Howard TV gets miffed and starts filing C&D complaints with YouTube.

It's only a matter of time before they start sniffing out the source and you will have people like ""SternGeek"" to blame.

A guy who I politely asked not to share our content and he responded with a childish bratty attitude and bragged about making money off his mind numbing overuse of advertisements.

Stop supporting losers.  We are the ones who do all the work and even we don't put ADs or charge for our content.  What does that say about him?

It says that he's simply here to take advantage of people who aren't members of WDM and profit off them.  He is not someone who is here to share free content he is simply funneling money because he can't get a real job."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-12T19:58Z,"SternGeek has shared 128K versions of your Stern show encodes from time to time, but mainly he does them and / or acquires them from someone else at 80K.  He no longer posts the 64K version.  Most of the time it's 80K and nothing else from SG.

There is a 32K version posted on Bolt.cd forums , but the audio quality is noticeable poor so I don't get those copies."
,randygunn,2013-06-12T21:06Z,"Wush - You are THE MAN! Well said my friend. I wish people would listen to you and stop bringing negative and unwanted attention to this. As someone who very much appreciates what you do, I say Thank you for all the work. I don't have Sirius and I don't have Paypal for WDM so I depend on TPB torrents from you Wush and I love you for it man! Thank you again."
,Mr_Brisk,2013-06-12T22:00Z,thanks for all your hard work!
,ChefEm,2013-06-12T22:32Z,Thanks for all you do here wush!
,lky001,2013-06-12T23:42Z,@TheExecutive: I download only 64K torrents. They are smaller and faster to download. It's all mostly talk anyway so even a lower quality would suffice.
