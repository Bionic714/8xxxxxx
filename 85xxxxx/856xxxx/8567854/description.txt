A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda is driven by platforming and combat, and by playing the game with an Xbox 360 controller plugged into your PC, you'll be able to play it like the console classics of yore. Ares, the main character, is a robot designed to protect his human creators. There's a deep story hiding underneath the game's facade, but I found it to be extremely muddled and, moreover, totally unimportant to my overall enjoyment of the game. Where A.R.E.S. really draws its inspiration (and enjoyment) from titles like Mega Man X is in terms of combat, which will feel familiar to veterans of the Blue Bomber's core and X series. And beyond that, the impetus on gamers to unlock new weapons and upgrade them is yet another parallel between the two games.
