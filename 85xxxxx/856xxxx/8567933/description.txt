Puerto Rican Paradise

Puerto Rico's late-night hot spot, Oceano, is looking for an executive chef to expand their menu. Chef Anne Burrell brings in four candidates, who are challenged to create two dishes; a gourmet version of a traditional Puerto Rican dish, and a signature "sexy" dish for Oceano's menu. The two remaining chefs face the toughest test, running dinner service for an evening: One chef has to battle differences with the kitchen staff, while the other makes an executive decision that turns their hopes around.
