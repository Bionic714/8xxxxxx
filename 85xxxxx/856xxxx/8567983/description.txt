The wonderful thing about Edge is that, unlike pretty much every other
gaming magazine out there, it is not tied into any one platform
featuring the PC, PS3 Xbox360, Wii, PSVita, DS and even iOS games. Edge
is a Mecca for games journalists, featuring contributions from the
leading writers across every format, and includes famously expert and
honest reviews, all the latest news, fascinating insights and views from
within the games industry and features on the nature of gaming as a
whole. Beautifully designed and produced, Edge is a must for any gamer. A
consistent purveyor of fine covers, to boot
