,mrweldo,2013-06-13T04:26Z,"My inexperience caused me to forget to designate that this movie is NTSC and not PAL, for those of you who need to know.  Sorry."
,Talos63,2013-06-13T08:21Z,Thanks for this. What was the source for the ISO?
,mrweldo,2013-06-14T19:10Z,"The original was decrypted with DVD Decrypter.  It then was run through DVD Shrink to get the file size down.  Then the Video_TS folder was processed by the ""build mode"" of Image Burn to create the .iso file we have here."
,Talos63,2013-06-15T00:18Z,Watched it last night. Great quality all round. Thanks again!
