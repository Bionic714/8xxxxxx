[T],theburningbush,2013-06-13T14:23Z,"I know what you mean, wizzhop. This is a good time to exercise patience.

It's about five hours after most of the late-night shows were broadcast for June 12, and so far, both here and on KAT, there's no:
Daily Show
The Colbert Report
David Letterman
Jay Leno
Jimmy Kimmel
Craig Ferguson
Jimmy Fallon
Chelsea Lately
Conan

Patience..."
