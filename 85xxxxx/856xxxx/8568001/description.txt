Husband and wife, Albert (Hubert Geral) and Lulu (Sophie Duflot), run a brothel, Le Chat Rose, which is struggling financially. Albert and Lulu get a banker (Henry Darbac) to give them a loan by letting him win the services of the girls at games of cards and think they can rejuvenate the brothel by bringing in their daughter, Julie (Julia Perrin), who has been fostered out to a couple who pretend to be priest and nun. They defeat debt collectors by photographing them with Fifi (Marilyn Jess).
