RCA/Legacy will release another Elvis Presley 40th Anniversary concert reissue on 18 March 2013. 

Aloha From Hawaii Via Satellite is the soundtrack to PresleyΓÇÖs 1973 concert which was broadcast by satellite around the globe. This Legacy edition brings together a remastered version of the original 24-track album, with a brand new, remixed and remastered edition of the rehearsal show (which was released separately in 1988 as Alternate Aloha). Additionally, the audio from a five-track audience-free private show, recorded in the early hours of the morning for broadcast on US TV, is included on the second disc.


Elvis was at pains not to duplicate much material from his Live At Madison Square Gardens shows that took place the previous year (released as Prince From Another Planet in 2012) and he was also keen to avoid material from his film Elvis On Tour which was doing brisk business, and would go on to win a Golden Globe. This lead to a set which included The BeatlesΓÇÖ Something, SinatraΓÇÖs My Way, Johnny B. Goode and the rock ΓÇÿnΓÇÖ roll medley of Long Tall Sally/Whole Lot Of ShakinΓÇÖ Going On.
