,Bedlam66,2013-06-13T02:03Z,Is there a season 9 torrent that collects all of season 9 and the spinoffs 
,mastacow2,2013-06-13T04:47Z,"@Bedlam66  I did a quick search and didn't find any full packs including the spinoffs. Just this one collecting 1-16 of Buffy s9.

There will probably be one up though in another few months -- I think they are doing 25 issues but don't take my word for it."
,Bedlam66,2013-06-13T08:23Z,Thanks the end issue is what I needed to know. I'll wait till season 9 is over before I read it. I did the same with season 8 and it was much better that way. 
,mastacow2,2013-06-13T10:02Z,"@bedlam66 Right on. I think you will be pleased with it and the spinoffs when you do read it. There were some missteps in the beginning, but overall I've really liked s9"
