This is from the original scanner. I adjusted the resolution and compressed the file for easier reading on tablets and ereaders. I have added 'Tablet Edition' to the name to avoid confusion.

Enjoy and please seed back.

When thirteen satellites fall from the sky in one day, the logical suspect is Lex Luthor-even though he's still locked up in prison! But a stranger question remains: If Superman didn't stop the last satellite from falling, who did? There's an mystery hidden where even Superman can't see it-Can The Man of Steel drag a decades-old secret into the light?

Don't miss the debut of this red-hot new series from two of comics' brightest superstars: SCOTT SNYDER and JIM LEE!
