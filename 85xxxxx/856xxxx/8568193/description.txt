Works on my Sammie 46" 7100 Series 3D 1080p LED HDTV. I just hook WD Passport  hard drive up to the USB connection {on the input panel} and it works. I personally run it through my Sammie Blu Ray player {through the front USB port} so I get to use my Onyko TX-SR875 Audio/Video Processor for better sound and picture. Plug and Play no conversion necessary!

Plays With: WMP, PowerDVD, Nero Kwik Media, QuickTime. haven't tried any others but doesn't seem to have any problems playing on whatever I open it with it's .avi should play on most anything. 


Main Cast: Taylor Handley, Dustin Seavey, Alison Folland

Storyline: In this provocative teen comedy, Luke, a young man insecure about his masculinity discovers he's a Zerophiliac, with the ability to change sex at will. Join Luke as he journeys into the extraordinary world of Zerophilia where so many crazy questions arise, only one question matters: "Whom do you love?" 


PS I haven't figured out how to upload to Bayimg (or find the IMDB ID) yet but do have cover art and would like to include. If anyone has tips feel free to add a comment.
