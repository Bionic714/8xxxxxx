The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys #1

Years ago, the Killjoys fought against the tyrannical megacorporation Better Living Industries, costing them their lives, save for one -- the mysterious Girl. Today, the followers of the original Killjoys languish in the Desert while BLI systematically strips citizens of their individuality. As the fight for freedom fades, it's left to the Girl to take up the mantle and bring down the fearsome BLI or else join the mindless ranks of Bat City!
