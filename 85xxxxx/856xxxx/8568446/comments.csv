,Tedow,2013-06-13T05:27Z,"As the 8th commenter I am severely depressed at the fact that all of you tards above are selfish enough to ask for a A/V instead of doing what I did and spending 22 mins downloading it and checking it out for yourself and then posting a comment on the quality! Fucking NOOBS! Why should I comment for any of you? YOU ARE LEECHS ON THE COMMUNITY!
ANYWAYS: 
THIS IS ENTIRELY IN RUSSIAN
A: 7
V: 8
Based on CAM rating.  
In Soviet Russia, comments leave you."
,DigitalCr0w,2013-06-13T05:28Z,"A: Non English V: 6 Torrent is getting better, but non English...
Someone pls release: The Purge"
,Tedow,2013-06-13T05:42Z,"So it looks like my first comment got deleted probably because I was bashing all you ungrateful noobs asking for quality without even downloading.  So I'll keep it shorter this time:
THIS IS ENTIRELY IN RUSSIAN NOT ENGLISH
A: 7
V: 8
Based on Cam Ratings. 
In Soviet Russia, comment leaves you.  "
,ScottyD7421,2013-06-13T06:25Z,"@Tedow, much obliged. "
,drudigger,2013-06-13T07:10Z,"Why are people commenting that its not English when the torrent clearly states that its in Russian?

A:7 V:7 "
,El_Captn,2013-06-13T07:14Z,OBVIOUSLY its Russian because it says RUS in the title DUH
,saint84,2013-06-13T11:47Z,not commenting it is not in english . asking for a release in english . not the same 
,dysewell,2013-06-14T18:02Z,DONT SEED NOT ENGLISH
,q1689,2013-06-15T20:36Z,"Best Video and Audio so far, if only if I speak  Russian."
