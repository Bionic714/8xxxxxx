See torrent files for track listings  CDG+MP3 files tagged and good to go.

Well this is the last of it (for now) but like all collections it is dynamic and always being updated and revised.   If you have downloaded the whole lot you should have over 20 thousand unique tracks.   I see Karaoke outfits all the time boasting they have over 100 thousand tracks and I go YEAH RIGHT... Even if you add the combined totals of every Sunfly and Sound Choice Karaoke you will not get anywhere near 100,000 and of course you will have many thousands of duplicate songs!

Of course had the Karaoke companies moved with the technology and moved away from a Disc or physical media base to digital with PC friendly tags, I would not have had to spend the thousands of hours re titling each track to make it search friendly on a computer.  So when they bitch about file share, may I suggest that they listen to us and give us digital downloads just like our Audio and Music Video suppliers are!!!

That's it then, until the next time...  Cheers Rigmar Radio - Rockin' the Free World since 1967
