Put your UDID in the notes. 
Activation in seconds!
If you want to have your iOS 7 to not be deactivated by apple I suggest you have a developer active it."

I also accept Bitcoin or Litecoin for a discounted price, email me if you would like to pay with BTC or LTC."
,hole896,2013-06-14T22:34Z,"You DO NOT need to register your UDID to use iOS 7 on any device, although if you want to activate the iPhone, you must register it. The iOS will function fully without registering the UDID."
,saumil89,2013-06-15T17:51Z,"Okay People, don't get fooled by people asking for payment or with the reason of it is laggy without UDID!

If I can run iOS 7 perfectly on my iPhone 4 without any glitches.

Here's the trick to avoid the glitches (What I did)
The update (iOS 7) will ONLY upgrade your current OS keeping intact ALL the settings THUS making it laggy.

Download iOS 6.1.3 or 6.1.4 (iPhone 5), Take backup of ONLY contacts, save your photos.

RESTORE the iPhone to 6.1.3 or 6.1.4, CLEAN Install (JUST Install the OS, do not change or fiddle with nething)
Now, Keep holding left shift key and click on check for updates and select the iOS 7, your phone will start updating.

Once done, download & install the apps from iTunes, restore contact backup from cloud or any app and photos, music, etc.

And then open settings and change it as per your requirements.
Close all APPS and restart the phone.

It WILL WORK PERFECTLY !

Let me know if this trick works for you."

,wytwolf,2013-06-16T14:40Z,It keeps telling me i need to have a developer liscence.
,ebarne,2013-06-17T01:54Z,NOT so simple to install without Apple developer account. You can try and have a useless iPhone/ iPad or play it safe and send me $4 and your UDID thru paypal and ill add it to my developer account. If you are not sure how to get your UDID- Click on serial number in ITunes. I have 90 slots still available iosdevelopin@gmail.com
