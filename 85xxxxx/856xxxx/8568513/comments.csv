,Mudnotes,2013-06-14T05:28Z,"Thanks for this.

Now, in order for the KMS-activation for Windows 8 to activate, do I have to be online?"
[V],murphy78,2013-06-14T14:49Z,"mud, CODYQX4's KMS Server Service emulates the traffic, and no network connection is necessary.  That doesn't mean that an overzealous security program can't try to block things, though. Be careful which security programs you install or allow the KMSServerService.exe and any associated firewall traffic. Even though it is just localhost traffic that doesn't actually go anywhere, the OS is set up to obey any firewall programs or hardware settings."
