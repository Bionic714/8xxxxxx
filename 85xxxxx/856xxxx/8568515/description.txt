Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Wednesday, June 12 transmission of The Alex Jones Show, Alex continues to break down the NSA spy grid scandal shoved into the mainstream spotlight by a 29-year-old NSA contractor now taking refuge in Hong Kong, from which he plans to disclose more details on U.S. surveillance targets. 

Alex examines the massive criminality and brazenness of those actively working to deconstruct the Constitution, who at the same time attempt to convince us that, in order to preserve liberty, more security is necessary. 

On today's show, we'll listen to former Congressman Ron Paul's defense of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who is surprisingly being labeled a 'traitor' by members of the Republican party. 

We also welcome journalist and author Wayne Madsen to give his take on the giant whirlwind of scandals.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
