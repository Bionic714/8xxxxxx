In these 8 video presentations David Asscherick presents evidence from various historical sources and compares them with what the Bible states on each issue, step by step.

Aside from the title of this torrent The Actual, Certain, Unavoidable Identity of the Antichrist, another interesting video is; How to Get and Remain Undeceived.

Something no one wants to be, is deceived!


These videos are interesting for believers and non-believers alike.
The presentation style takes a little getting used to but, is well worth the time spent to watch a few hours in the grand scheme of our daily lives which encompass 24 hours per day.

One hour per day for 8 days is all it takes to accomplish this goal, and as I said, it is well worth the time spent once you find out what the information is within, which is revealed.

I have seen them all, and I recommend them so highly, I will probably watch them again.
