Blackgas description:

Horror gets a whole lot more terrifying as Warren Ellis unleashes his full-color zombie epic! A tiny little island off the East Coast of America, that sits on its own tiny little fault in the underlying tectonic plate. An odd little history ignored by almost everyone. Until the night of the big storm, and the creak in the fault line, and the release of something foul from the earth's guts, blown across the little town on Smoky Island. And the only two people on the island who were outside its reach are now trapped on a black spit of rock with a population who aren't people anymore. They started eating each other an hour ago.


Blackgas 2 description:

It's just a handful of miles from Smoky Island to the city of Hope on the northwest coast of the United States. It didn't take long for the cloud of black gas that erupted from the middle of Smoky Island to blow across the Atlantic channel between them. Soo Park is the sole survivor of what the black gas did to Smoky Island. She thought she'd be safe when she got to the mainland. She could not have been more wrong. The black gas turned the few hundred people on Smoky Island into insane death-crazed cannibals. There are a million people in the city of Hope. This is a zombie holocaust.
