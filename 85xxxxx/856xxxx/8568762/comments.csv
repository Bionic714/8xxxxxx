My client is telling me it will take OVER 24 hours to get 4.7 GB.. something I personally can seed in 4 hours or less and that is just ONE SEED and there are 4 of you."
,rigmar_radio,2013-06-13T08:01Z,"OK now this is getting silly.  49 hours estimated time for just 4Gigs...  Come on seeders, give me a copy at 1 mega bit per second and my seed box will look after the growing swarm...  You guys want seriously to look at my guide to good torrents available all over the net so you can manage your internet speeds properly... How many torrents have you all got running at the same time??  Too Many is my guess.  Rigmar Radio seeding at sensible speeds to the World since whenever...."
,rigmar_radio,2013-06-13T14:08Z,"Thanks Guys,  Seeding rate sorted and now my Seed box has 100% you will grab this at the RATE OF FAST!  Great Music and Great Quality as always.

I must find out where I can purchase this legally outside of North America if possible."
