In 1952, the U.S. Government's nuclear testing killed all of the good people of Sorrow, Nevada. Today, the sign in front of town reads "population zero". The locals, however, will tell you a very different story... When a car accident strands four young travelers in this desolate ghost town, they soon find that not all that is buried is dead. A modern take on the classic ghost story SORROW mingles the psychological terror of The Exorcist with the eerie dread of David Lynch's Twin Peaks to inspire fear in the most hardened of horror fans.
