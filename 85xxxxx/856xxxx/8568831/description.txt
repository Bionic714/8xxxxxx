
This adorable game, set in the middle of a picturesque garden, has you helping Shiny, the cute little firefly, to find his babies. YouΓÇÖll have to fly, run, hide and defend yourself against a legion of enemies. Stubborn mosquitoes, hungry toads, mischievous plants, sneaky wasps, endlessly long centipedes and lots of other little, dangerous garden dwellers are going to get in your way and make your life difficult.

Your reflexes will be tested, as well as your wit and intellect as you navigate through this beautiful, colorful world helping Shiny in his search. All kinds of different animations let you know how ShinyΓÇÖs feeling. So youΓÇÖll always know if heΓÇÖs feeling happy, concerned, tired or angry. That will help you solve the trickiest situations in the game. Use your ability to shine skillfully: the babies can only follow Shiny when he is lit up, but that also makes him visible to his enemiesΓÇª

Can you reunite Shiny with his family?
