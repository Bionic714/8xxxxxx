The audio is out of sync with the video.

Its a simple fix, just open MKVMerge then open/drag the .MKV file. Once the MKV file is opened you should see its video and audio track show up. Just highlight the video track and look for a tab that says ""Format Specific Options"" and change the FPS to 30000/1001 and then mux it.

It should then play back at proper video FPS and be in sync again.

I may reupload this with the episode fixed but just incase, heres how to fix it yourself easily.

Enjoy!"
