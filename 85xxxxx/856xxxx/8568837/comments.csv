,PM987,2013-06-13T04:38Z,Please seed this torrent.
,muckymucks,2013-06-13T10:20Z,This looks intriguing.
,muckymucks,2013-06-13T10:21Z,It's kind of the same concept as that Johnathan Ross comic I'm blanking out on this moment.
,Pheav,2013-06-13T10:53Z,Thanks for the upload matu23
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-13T11:17Z,"...Howabout sticking the fuck around to actually *seed* this torrent? I""m willing to keep it up for seed for a week, but as you can see there's 100+ leeches waiting for this godsdamn seed to even *START*!

If you can't be arsed to at least make sure others are seeding, then don't bother uploading the torrent and running. You're just wasting our time...

,ChingaTuu,2013-06-13T15:02Z,"...Thank you, sir. And to the catamite who failed to seed this properly, on behalf of the 150+ who snagged the torrent and got shafted, go fuck yourself. With knobs on it. Sans K-Y. Or even the ability to give your own ass a thank-you kiss."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-13T15:03Z,...Just did a little checking: this guy's got a history of posting torrents and not sticking around long enough for them to seed. I suggest ignoring his posts in the future.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-13T18:13Z,"everything else he's posted has been in spanish. wonder if this was, too? anyway yeah, failing to seed sucks."
,mstork5,2013-06-16T06:49Z,"The older torrent has the 3 spin-offs as well, so even better."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-17T04:54Z,"forgot to mention, you can get most if not all of this series in my torrent:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/7973340/  in the form of RISING STARS COMPENDIUM 1 and 2."
