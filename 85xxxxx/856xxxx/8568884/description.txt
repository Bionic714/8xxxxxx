Can't believe I never heard of these guys until the Ripple re-issue came out. Let Me In is a killer blend of Black Sabbath/Alice Cooper style heaviness mixed with James Gang/Grand Funk Railroad boogie rock. Get it, get high and get gone!

One of those great albums that never made it to on the charts, but if you love rock and roll then this has to be in your collection or it is not complete.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
3 piece heavy power trio.Rolling and crashing drums,heavy bass,great guitar sound,stoned vocals with a touch of humor.A little bit of psych,but mostly strait ahead hard rock,with a bit of a garage feel.18 songs 75 plus minutes,sound quality on disc A-1.Informative CD booklet with lyrics.Songs like Mr. Destroyer,Live To Work,Rock-n-Roll,and Let Me In absolutely crank to 10!Bonus trax Make A Man Outta You,Walk Of The Bug,Going To Rock City,and I'm Crazy,You're Crazy put this disc over the top!Comparisons are always tricky and subjective,it might be easier to say who they don't sound like.If you dig on Buffalo,Frijid Pink,Sir Lord Baltimore,Dust and other similar stuff from this era,you will want this in your collection too.Rock On!
