,Doctor_Whozzat,2013-06-13T10:26Z,"@Kerror; Well this was assembled from my old row suite, without monitoring what's out now. I just built-on & still gave credit. Only this one doesn't use an installer.  I play mine from disk & thought others might like the same portability..  :)"
,Doctor_Whozzat,2013-06-14T07:14Z,"*If anyone has a clue about the 'Fantastic Four' table or other missing ones, please post me a link & I'll look into it, after vacation~ Thx, guys! "
