Sofia the First: Once Upon a Princess (WEB-DL - 720p - MP4)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Set in the storybook world of Enchancia, Sofia is an average girl whose
life suddenly transforms when her mother marries the king and she becomes
a princess. Sofia's royal adventure begins as she prepares to move into the
castle with her mom, starting a new family with her step-father, King Roland II,
and step-siblings, Amber and James. Helping Sofia in her journey are the three
headmistresses of Royal Prep Academy - Fauna, Flora and Merryweather and royal
steward, Baileywick, as well as a group of cute woodland creatures led by a
wise-talking rabbit, Clover. Sofia soon discovers that looking like a princess
isn't all that difficult, but displaying honesty, loyalty, courage, independence,
compassion and grace is what makes one truly royal.
