I'm sorry to bother. Take a look at this:

Your an Idiot...

It's a hacked version it takes all those things out.


Try regular pandora try and skip 6 times.  and You'll get  ""Max skips per hour"" 

Then try this 6 times or even 100 times it will always skip.

If you don't think it works don't use it! 

Or you could even read the reviews on the older version:

Sorry :) U R right. Sometimes, I can be very ""slow"". I will try it!"
,TheEmpathicEar,2013-06-13T18:42Z,"It seems great so far. U have to create an account. I wonder what the sound quality is when U choose the ""Higher"" quality setting?"

Ah Yes sorry my misunderstanding, if you do not have a account already you have to make one. But this version is by far better than the Pandora One paid version . (I know, I pay for Pandora One)


Ya the Higher quality in settings is better. I never actually measured it but I believe it's about 192 to 256 Kbps.

I don't think they push it much higher than that due music lag on 3g/4g networks.

Thx for all your time and patience! I think what I was worried about in creating an account was that Pandora would ""find out"" somehow and do something? But, as you can tell so far here,  my imagination knows no bounds! LOL"
,DARKWEED,2013-06-14T19:19Z,"Not good,  the best still the 4.1 need the orbot tor (country verification) to enter the application but I can close and use with unlimited hours the 4.1.2 is awesome no need orbot but have 40 hours limit, and this one says every time not avaliable to your country and this makes it the worst one if it could be fixed...
