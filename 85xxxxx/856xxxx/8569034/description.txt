This is a repair package that the aspect ratios were corrected per season. Also Episode "2 15 Pink Gold" had an A/V sync issue that was fixed. The file could not be converted to another file type without an A/V sync issue. So I worked some magic and fixed it.

Seasons 1 - 2 are 4:3 Standard Aspect Ratio. Seasons 3 - 5 are 16:9 Widescreen Aspect Ratio. This is based on the Bernie Mac Complete Series Download.

The Following episodes of the series are poor quality. I will be uploading new better versions of these files in the next couple weeks as I get them. The rest of the series is good quality.
