What's New
Version 5.0:

New features:
* Advanced Healing Brush: Easily remove objects and fix defects -
 - even those with irregular shapes such as threads or lint -- with a ' 
  single brush stroke. Take precise control over what's being removed as
  you make unwanted objects just disappear.

* Upright: Straighten tilted images with a single click. Upright analyzes
   images and detects skewed horizontal or vertical lines. You choose 
  one of four correction methods, and Upright can even straighten 
  images where the horizon is hidden.

* Radial Gradient: Lead your viewer's eye through your images with
   more flexibility and control. The radial gradient tool lets you create 
  off-center vignette effects, or multiple vignette areas within a single
   image.

* Offline editing with Smart Previews: Easily work with images
   without bringing your entire library with you. Just generate smaller
   stand-in files called Smart Previews. Make adjustments or metadata 
  additions to Smart Previews and your changes will be automatically 
  applied to the full-size originals later.

* Video slideshow sharing: Easily share your work in elegant video
   slideshows. Combine still images, video clips, and music in creative 
  HD videos that can be viewed on almost any computer or device.

* Improved photo book creation: Create beautiful photo books from 
  your images. Lightroom includes a variety of easy-to-use book 
  templates, and now you can edit them to create a customized look.
  Upload your book for printing with just a few clicks.

* Slideshows that mix video and still images

* The ability to share photos using the Behance Publish Service

* Expanded range on the Radial Filter’s feather slider
