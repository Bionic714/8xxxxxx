,phase700b,2013-06-13T04:01Z,Thanks HighCode. This one must have some fast moving action. You usually don't rev up the video KBps quite this high.
[V],HighCode,2013-06-13T06:58Z,"Yes, very fast moving camera and lots of very dark scenes. Poor filming by the way as if amateur filmed it, lots of cuts...
I personally hate shaking-filming, it makes me headache lol.

Those who saw ""Ong Bak Trilogy 2003-2010 BDRip 1080p DTS Tha Hun- HighCode "" will agree that all 3 were very professionally filmed, you could see each movement in each fighting clearly."
