NFO ---> this one was a bitch! @ 29:24 to 29:56 there was an emergency alert pop up bull shit! on top of that it had that annoying alert sound and blah blah, i recorded the standard def version on demand and synced in the audio for that segment and i blocked out the scrolling warning as much as i could as it was distracting! i hope the scene does this one so we can have a clean copy, all in all pretty good though"
