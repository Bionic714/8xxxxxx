ID Collection - DooM Brutal Edition


Mainly, it's my personal classic Doom collection. It contains Doom 64 for PC, Ultimate Doom (Doom 1 plus one extra episode), Doom 2, TNT Evilution and Plutonia Experiment expansion packs. I included a bonus, Strife - Quest for the Sigil (voices included), one of the best underrated Raven games ever.

Excluding Doom 64, all Doom games are running with Hi-Res textures packs (not ugly 3d models), Hi-quality MP3 music (instead of old MIDI music) AND with Brutal Mod by Sergeant_Mark_IV. This mod brings ultra stylish gore, with tons of well-made new moves, fatalities (!) and animations.

Run GZDOOM.EXE to start classic doom games
Run ABSOLUTION.EXE inside D64/BIN folders to run Doom 64
Run GZDOOM.EXE inside STRIFE folder to run STRIFE.

Enjoy!
