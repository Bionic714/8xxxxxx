A thriller set in present day Egypt. Daniel is a perpetually hard up writer and expert on Coptic art. He meets Canadian student Tara who asks him to take a letter to a senior politician whose son Daniel tutors in English. The politician is angered and orders Daniel not to return, but Daniel is aware that a significant sum of money is available for successful completion of his task. He thus weaves a story to Tara, but matters spiral out of his control. Who is double crossing whom?
