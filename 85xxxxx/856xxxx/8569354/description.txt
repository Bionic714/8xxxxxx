NOTES:
In order to remove watermarks we didn't want included in the release, we had to crop off a small portion of the top and bottom of the screen. Due to the short runtime of the film, and the source only having 2.0 audio, we decided to go with a 700MB encode for this one. Take it or leave it!

AXED! We do this better.
