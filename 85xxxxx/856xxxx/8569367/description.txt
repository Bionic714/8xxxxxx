"King & Maxwell" -- They disagree on almost every issue -- personal and otherwise -- but one thing they see eye to eye on is doing whatever it takes to nail the bad guys. Former Secret Service agents Sean King and Michelle Maxwell used to protect politicians, but now they combine their unique skills -- not to mention razor-sharp chemistry -- to investigate criminals in and around Washington, D.C. Maxwell, a former elite athlete, uses her brains, beauty and Beltway connections to get a leg up on suspects and conventional law enforcement, and with a new law degree added to his resume, King is able to navigate the system in ways other private eyes only dream of. Author David Baldacci developed the King and Maxwell characters in a series of best-selling books.
