Burial is the first album by the Norwegian Christian metal band Extol. 

It was released on Endtime Productions and then Solid State Records the following year. According to Allmusic, Burial was "a breath of fresh air among a genre that relies on satanic gimmicks",[1] and marked a renewal in the Christian metal scene. 

In 2010, HM magazine ranked it #13 on the Top 100 Christian metal albums of all time list.[2]
