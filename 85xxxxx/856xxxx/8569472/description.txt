TV mini series, in which modern individuals are placed in an historical setting, and expected to play the roles assigned to them. There are several historical periods used as scenarios for the "House Party" format: this is set in Regency England, when the future King George IV was acting as Prince Regent for his father George III, who had gone insane.

This is the PBS version, in 4 1.5 hour episodes, packed into 2 3-hour files.
