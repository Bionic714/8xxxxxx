I couldn't find Attack on Titan in CBR anywhere so I did it myself.

All of the jpegs were taken from http://www.mangahere.com/manga/shingeki_no_kyojin/
You can read it online but I much prefer to read it on my phone.

The CBRs are separated into volumes and the jpegs are separated into chapters.
If you only want one or the other just deselect them.


Enjoy
