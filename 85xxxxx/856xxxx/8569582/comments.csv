,drudigger,2013-06-13T09:09Z,Thanks for finishing the seed Will continue seeding for 4 days at 5.0MB a second. will post a.v. after viewing movie.
,drudigger,2013-06-13T10:08Z,Ok i couldn't even finish watching this V.7 A.1 Audio is horrible sounds like it was recorded with a flip phone. And after about 15 minutes it gets completely d-synced by about 1 min - 1min 30 secs. Making it completely impossible to stand watching such a thing. This is the best Video out right now but the audio source is absolutely horrible wait for another copy and if you cant wait just go pay to see the movie its not worth watching this and not being able to see what you hear.

,Finchizzle,2013-06-13T12:43Z,"I want to see this movie so bad and Im really trying to watch it but the audio is super tingy and difficult to withstand. Video is watchable, but even after messing with the audio on VLC its hard to put up with. "
,Finchizzle,2013-06-13T13:08Z,At around 25 minutes the audio completely fucks up
,zakimar5,2013-06-13T21:04Z,Eisenberg stars? This movie will lose money!
,healer66,2013-06-13T21:37Z,"would happily watch it, but here in Norway the release date is NOV08,2013 can you believe that ?! what a fuck is wrong with this country ???? Fast and Furious was released the same day when in the States, and this movie is far better !"
,maverickbleh,2013-06-14T00:35Z,"You say the audio fucks up at around 25 min, but is it OK after that?"
