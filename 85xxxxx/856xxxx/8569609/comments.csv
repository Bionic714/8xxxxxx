,michaelrwatson,2013-06-14T08:04Z,"Hey, heey, YIFY, dude, you've created another shitcrapper that stutters, has out of sync audio, etc.

WHat is wrong with you? At least you're not making MKV's anymore."
,xarinl,2013-06-14T21:58Z,I am gonna check if this one has audio out of synch. YIFY usually doesn't have bad quality rips.
,Cheks1,2013-06-15T03:38Z,"@michaelwatson oi dickhead - leave your hate elsewhere and be grateful! - @xarinl - this rip is not out of synch. at all, ignore that other loser - and thanks @yify for another great upload BUT: this is the 1st time one of your rips has had Cinavia coding on it, which is a bit annoying!"
