Sometimes the videos do not show up and it is only audio so I have to convert it again to work, or the audio has a watermark so I have to change my date every few minutes to watch it.

Before I would just download it and it was ready to go, and it was really nice. But not anymore ;/.

Still the audio is great and so is the video its just not ps3 friendly."
,xivanx,2013-06-14T01:36Z,"Damn, another one of YIFY's torrents don't work on the ps3. To the people having problems playing his 1080p movies lately, the 720p versions don't seem to have this problem with the ps3 (audio but no picture)."
