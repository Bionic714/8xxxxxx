,Dwch,2013-06-14T01:46Z,"Could someone please tell me where to find Before Watchmen Dr. Manhattan 01 (2012) (Zone-Empire) in HD? It seems like every issue of every Before Watchmen has been done/re-released in digital-HD except that one. I can find the first issue but it's only 1280px and does not ""match"" the rest of the set... ShipJ any pointers?"
,Ahlat,2013-06-14T11:59Z,Thanks ShipJ. Great uploads.

Dwch - The release in question seems to have fallen through the cracks, i.e. either does not (yet) exist at all or never made it to wider distribution.
