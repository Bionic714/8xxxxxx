Charge is David FordΓÇÖs fourth solo studio album. Since leaving Easyworld in 2004, heΓÇÖs remained defiantly under the mainstream radar, causing a stir with his debut single State Of The Union and its homemade video of a solo performance of the song in his home basement and having his potential breakthrough second album Songs For The Road lost commercially as label Independiente struggled to pay the bills. Accepting his lot, he went back to self-funding, self-promoting for this third album Let The Hard Times Roll and a series of EPs over the past couple of years, continuing to play live and astound his dedicated fanbase.

The album reflects those struggles heΓÇÖs faced as an artist, documenting a disastrous solo tour of the southern US on Pour A Little Poison, describing himself as a ΓÇ£whiny little English boy singing the bluesΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£staring at the walls of the Motel 6ΓÇ¥ over a mouth organ led stomp that you canΓÇÖt help but tap your feet too. ThereΓÇÖs also Philadelphia Boy about the way a crowd in Philadelphia took him to their hearts when he almost broke down on stage during another tour and his subsequent love for the city.

Most potent is however album closer Every Time, six minutes of musing over missed opportunities, getting shafted by the business and waking up to the realization heΓÇÖs making music that he loves and thatΓÇÖs whatΓÇÖs important to him. ItΓÇÖs FordΓÇÖs career summed up in one massive explosion of self-exploration. One criticism occasionally and unfairly thrown at David is that he doesnΓÇÖt transfer the power and passion of his live shows to record - there can be no such accusations here.

Unlike FordΓÇÖs previous albums, there are huge variations in pace and mood as the album progresses. The Ballad Of Miss Lily is a balls-out stomp about a man falling in love with one of those girls who just want a guy for his money and Let It Burn has a storming funk beat right through the middle of it with guitar licks dropping in and out in the chorus. And sandwiched between the two is IsnΓÇÖt It Strange, one of those tender tear-jerking ballads that Ford produces with impressive regularity. Moving On is another of those, talking of ΓÇ£a mind to let all fortuneΓÇÖs chips fall where they mayΓÇ¥.

WhatΓÇÖs Not To Love is a simple love song played out on piano with the simple chorus refrain ΓÇ£if you asked me why do I love her, then tell me whatΓÇÖs not to loveΓÇ¥. ItΓÇÖs followed by the highlight of the album Perfect Soul, another love song but from the angle of a man pleading his case to a woman - ΓÇ£if youΓÇÖre craving romance, then IΓÇÖll show up bearing flowersΓÇ¥ but with the proviso ΓÇ£donΓÇÖt go pinning all your hopes on me, I can make you a pretty promise, but thatΓÇÖs no guaranteeΓÇ¥. ItΓÇÖs got some beautiful brass scattered over the chorus and some unusual key changes, but it all fits together perfectly.

Charge may just be FordΓÇÖs best album to date. It doesnΓÇÖt fit as seamlessly together as the previous ones, but whilst that might be seen as an issue, itΓÇÖs actually its strength. Ford has never been an artist to play by the traditional rules and with this album heΓÇÖs not bound by any pressure to sell tens of thousands of copies so itΓÇÖs free of any outside constraints or expectations.
