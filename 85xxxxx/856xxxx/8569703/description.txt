Welcome to Plex!

Plex is a media platform that is capable of organizing your media so that it can be 

viewed by any Plex app. In addition to allowing you to view all of your music, 

photos 

and videos, you can access online content from many of your favorite online 

providers 

via Plex channels. Plex currently supports over 200 channels including CNET, 

YouTube, 

Vimeo, Revision3 and many other popular online sources. With Plex Media Server for 

Mac you can stream additional content from Aperture, iPhoto, and iTunes.

New to Plex? Start with these simple steps:

2. Go through the setup process and add all your media.

3. Access your media from any Plex app, they're available for Android, iOS, Mac,

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: How do I access my media from outside the home?

A: Signup for myPlex. Log into myPlex on the server side, and from the Plex apps.


Caveats and Disclaimers:

Plex streams video and audio, which can consume lots of bandwidth - be sure you 

have a healthy data plan before you start using 3G and 4G connections to stream 

your movies.

With the wide array of Android devices that Plex for Android can be run upon (over 

1200 as of this writing) we do expect to find some issues. Please check on our 

forums (http://forums.plexapp.com) for any problems you have.

DRM-protected content (older iTunes Store audio or any iTunes Store video) is not 

supported.

VIDEO_TS, ISO or IMG videos are not supported by Plex.
