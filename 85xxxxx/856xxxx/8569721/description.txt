It's Yasmin's first day on operations as an MI5 surveillance officer, staking out a suspect from the back of an innocuous looking van. She is watching Rashid, outwardly a hard working family man, trying to run a restaurant - or is this just a cover for something more sinister?


Further complications arise that in the van with her is her partner Jonathan. During the course of the stake out, their relationship too is put under strain.
