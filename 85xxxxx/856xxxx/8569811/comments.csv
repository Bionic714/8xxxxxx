I love your uploads."
,morte22,2013-06-13T12:20Z,"Yeah, it's too big for me and also I can't run 60fps movies on my netbook :/ Will you upload something smaller, possibly a 540p version? Cheers and keep up with your awesome uploads! We need you for those Stanley Cup playoffs!"
,morte22,2013-06-13T13:23Z,"Hey dude, could you let us know if you'll be uploading lower quality versions today? Cheers"
[V],Nepotu,2013-06-13T14:39Z,"Yes, in a few moments. 540p and 720p. At request I could upload also a 360p version."
,morte22,2013-06-13T15:01Z,You're awesome
,az25,2013-06-13T19:22Z,Is this NBC or CBC?
,BMcClusky,2013-06-14T04:39Z,"AMAZING job with all of the NHL uploads this season, Nepotu.

Can you also add the feed for these 60fps uploads in the title (i.e. NBC or CBC)?  Many thanks...."
,W123.130,2013-06-16T11:33Z,Netbook? Who uses that shit anymore? Even a 3 year old tablet is more powerful!
