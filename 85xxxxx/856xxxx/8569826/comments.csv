1. IF YOU HATE THE COCKPIT MOD IN BLUE PLANET, Please go to Blue Planet 2 folder and remove ""adv-bp2-cockpits.vp"".

2. For controls, I recommend binding these keys:
W for Acceleration
S for Deceleration
A for Bank Left
D for Bank Right
Space for Afterburner
Mouse Right Click for Launch Missles
Mouse Left Click for Primary weapons
Mouse Middle Click for Switch weapons

3. Don't forget to seed this great game!
Thanks!"
