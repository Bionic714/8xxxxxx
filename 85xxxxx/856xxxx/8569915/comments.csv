At the very least you should break it down into 500MB or 1GB chunks. You do good work and you up good stuff. Now you just need to add the pro touch to you work."

I'ts not my Job to upload it's a share! matter of fact what about your Upload ??  Zéro ?? and you give a damn for stupidity like that!

DO IT YOUR SELF MAN ! i guess for the 508 set it will took you 2 hours to create each folder and zip them!  "
,cazzo2,2013-06-13T15:18Z,Send me  25$ throught paypal i will do that for you for low as 12 buck hours :)
,cazzo2,2013-06-13T15:27Z,"Give me a break man!! i've upload and seeds more then 3tb in the last 60 day 1,5mb/s  24 hours a day. probaly more then 800 000 Pictures and alot of great vids. All my southern charms Siterip are made like that. i just can.t imagine to split aver 1,5 million pictures into folder...

You just share nothing, do it yourself if you wanna each set into folder. personally i prefert when i wanna watch one model i just open 1 picture and put it in slideshow mode."
,brianxxx,2013-06-13T19:03Z,"I was offering constructive criticism and advice and using other VIP techniques as an example. I did not attack you or get nasty as you have done. I even said PLEASE. 

I actually did upload and share A LOT, years ago under another screen name. Way more than you. But that does not matter as it is not relevant. I was simply trying to offer some good advice and guidance and even complemented you. Shame on you."
