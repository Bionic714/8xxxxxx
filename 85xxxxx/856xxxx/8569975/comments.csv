Worked great on my MBP w/ OS 10.6.8.
Cheers!"
,Bytepatcher,2013-06-13T21:00Z,"Yeah, go for it!"
,m0ww0w,2013-06-14T02:31Z,Rizzo220 for me it crashes constantly. Crashes after a export or a publish. That is not right.
,Rizzo220,2013-06-14T17:01Z,"@ m0ww0w... 
I had v1.2.10 and dropped this version onto my old version. I've had zero problems with this.
State the OS you are using with it. "
