A:4 (Hard to hear at times, has that tin cup and a string sound)

Watchable, best copy out so far. 
Thanks for the upload"

,IncomePitbull,2013-06-14T00:41Z,"Now this is a prime example of what a 2013 CAM should look like :) Just judging by the screens, so I haven't heard the audio lol.

Take note those guys who have released shitty cams recently, this is what we are looking for. It is obvious that with 2013 technology it is completely possible to produce good CAMs!

This was probably recorded on a $200 HD camcorder.. so it is not unreasonable to have a good cam, as it is extremely affordable!"

,TWEETY2455,2013-06-14T06:29Z,"About the Audio if u use VLC just use reverse  stereo,. and went perfect at least for me."
,TWEETY2455,2013-06-14T06:30Z,"V=8+
A=7,5 if u reverse the stereo,."
,rensroC,2013-06-14T09:32Z,"Wow, the sound is horrible. I downloaded this, put it on my External HD and plugged it into my 55"" Samsung LED and the picture was pretty decent, but it sounded like an audio preset was changed to ""concert hall"" or something. I tried to mess around with the equalizer but into the TV but it didnt help.

V:7
A:2

Not watchable, unless you watch it on your PC and do what Tweety said.

Guess im waiting for a DVDScreener or something else. "
,Slvc123,2013-06-14T22:11Z,"Not the best copy, I saw this in theaters and it really fun. If you really want to see this film, I highly suggest going to the movie theater. It's that good."
,princeofperiabyte,2013-06-15T00:03Z,"Downloading now, will post the results once I have watched the film. :-)"
,regbrill,2013-06-16T02:58Z,"Great movie, but quality is pretty bad. I was searching, and I found HD version at hdmov.venter.nom.za ,and it worked great for me!"
