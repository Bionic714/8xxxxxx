NOTES
This is a really nice cam video and OK audio too. There was about 1:20 
missing from the English audio, so I cut that scene out. It's not a big
deal though and will not affect your understanding of the movie.
Audio is in sync with video from beginning to end.
Sample included. Enjoy!

Greetz to everyone!
