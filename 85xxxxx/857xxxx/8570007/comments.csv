I am not sure whats Intel HD 3000, it works on my Mac...

My Mac specs (MacBook Pro 2007 Mid/Late)

Processor- 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo

Memory- 4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM

Graphics- NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT 128 MB

OS- Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.4

If your Mac specs are higher or equal to mine, it should work, even an old Mac can work, yours should..."
,ninaana,2013-06-16T13:22Z,I have a MacBook Pro late 2011 with an Intel 3000HD and its run The Sims 3 but when I try to enter the house after picking up a household its crashes every time. But it runs perfectly in a Macbook early 2009 with a Nvidia GForce 9400

If your game crashes,this may be

-Your Mac don't support the Sims 3 (Very Unlikely)

-You installed mods (Unknown)

-Maybe the copy of The Sims 3 has bugs (Very Likely)

So in conclusion, if possible,go to google and search 'How to updated The Sims 3 cracked', but please back up your game before doing this."
