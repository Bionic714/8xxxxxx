SwiftKey replaces the touchscreen keyboard on your phone with one that understands 

how words work together, giving the worldΓÇÖs most accurate autocorrect - and 

predicting your next word before you press a key.

The keyboard learns as you use it to make corrections and predictions based on the 

way that you write. It can learn from your Gmail, Facebook, Twitter or blog to make 

its insights even more personalized. You can also enable up to three languages 

simultaneously, for true multi-lingual typing.

Switch seamlessly between tapping and gesture typing with our new SwiftKey Flow 

feature. It combines the mind-reading capabilities of SwiftKey with the speed of 

gliding your fingers across the screen. With ΓÇÿFlow Through SpaceΓÇÖ, you can also 

enter entire phrases without lifting your finger from the screen, simply by sliding 

to the space bar between words.
