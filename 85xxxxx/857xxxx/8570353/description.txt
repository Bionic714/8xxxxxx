    [Notes]

    Dancer and the Moon is Blackmore s Night 8th studio album. Despite Ritchie
    Blackmore's past as a guitar player in Deep Purple and Rainbow, he is now
in
    another stage of his musical life, concentrating on modern Folk,
Renaissance
    and Progressive Rock music. Besides Ritche s incredible talent as a guitar
    player, the other selling point for Blackmore s Night is vocalist Candice
    Night, the beautiful wife of Ritchie Blackmore who could be described as a
    younger, and folkier, version of Stevie Nicks.
