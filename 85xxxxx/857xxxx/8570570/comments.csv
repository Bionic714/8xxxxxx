I did look this one up. I only found one for sale in the UK for $64.

I have the hardware to rip vinyl (restored Dual 1229, Shure V 15 Type IV, Pro-Ject Tube Box II), but I haven't figured out the software.

My cover is in better condition than the included scan. So I scanned mine to make them available to others.
