One of the most sought after London "Blue Back" FFSS recordings from the 1950s, this disc of opulent music by Rimsky-Korsakov fetches $50 to $125 on LP these days. Conductor Ernest Ansermet and the L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande put a shimmer and glow on Korsakov's scores. This is a digitized edition of an item rarer than the LP - the original London four-track stereo tape from the 1960s.
