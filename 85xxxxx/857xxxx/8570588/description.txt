Thursday 06-13-2013: Ivo Daalder - United States Permanent Representative to NATO

In Brussels, Shaun Ley talks to Ivo Daalder, the United States' permanent representative to NATO. He is European by birth and an American citizen by choice, but are those two outlooks becoming increasingly hard to reconcile? There is tension over US surveillance that could affect Europeans and a division in NATO between what one US defence secretary calls those who pay - principally the Americans - and those who enjoy the benefits - the Europeans. As Ivo Daalder ends his term here, does he think it is time for this 64-year-old veteran security organisation to be pensioned off?
