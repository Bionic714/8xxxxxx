I don't suppose you have 'Futuretrack 5' anywhere? It is another novel by Westall. I have searched for it in the past, but have never found it in any form."

Another that you may find, one day, but asking more out of curiosity than anything else: 'Worldmakers', a short story collection edited by Gardner Dozois."
