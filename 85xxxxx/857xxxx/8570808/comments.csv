thanks a ton for your daily uploads. this one was up already though, but comparing seeds it seems like there are more people like me who use your uploads to discover new reading material."

Alot of the torrents I'm uploading are either brand new to ThePirateBay or someone else uploaded them a while ago but the seeds are very low. If the speed of any of the old uploads isn't viable enough I'll upload them so people have a chance at downloading them again! and no problem!"
