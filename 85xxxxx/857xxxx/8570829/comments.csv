[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-06-14T00:47Z,"...i forgot to mention....i deliberately DO NOT tag any of these....most people just delete them....and i usually start with an immense wave file....no data.....and crunch it to several mp3's to get the best sound....some stations sound better in mono....and some better at a sample rate of 22050 rather than 44100...etc...etc...and it would be pretty aggravating to keep entering in metadata for each one....BESIDES.....everybody has their own particular way of cataloging something like this...you said ''podcast''....i wouldn't have called it a podcast...it's live broadcast radio...so right there,... you wouldn't have liked the way it was labeled....so i leave alone and it's easier..."

,grider,2013-06-14T19:56Z,Well many devices only use 'podcast' or 'audio book' as tracks to resume on.  Other genres they don't.
[V],CAPTAIN7SS,2013-06-15T06:05Z,......well....good for for them...i've never used an mp3 player but i see what you're driving at.....so...that link i gave you offers about 2 dozen taggers...free ones...good ones.....and if it's so easy and necessary why can't you add that sfter you download it...??......are you doing this on an i-phone etc...and not a computer?
