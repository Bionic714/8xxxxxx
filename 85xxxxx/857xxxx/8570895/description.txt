Description:

Psychological horror in the vein of The Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt! In this first "Definitive" Collection of stories from the acclaimed online comic series, we delve into a world of ghostly lovers, demonic abductors, vengeful victims, and sexy Cthulhu priestesses as these loosely connected stories weave an epic tale of a world not unlike our own where nothing is what it seems. Welcome to Nightmare World! Written by "Write Or Wrong" Newsarama columnist Dirk Manning, featuring remastered art, extras, and a new in-continuity prose story.
