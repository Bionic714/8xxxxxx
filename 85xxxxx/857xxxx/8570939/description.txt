
WARNING: This game is hard.

The creator of Slydris, 2012 iOS Game of the Year*, is back with another elegant and intense puzzle game designed specifically for touch screens. CRUSH sounds simple: Keep the blocks from filling the screen by removing matching colors with a single touch. But the blocks keep coming, and each touch boosts the stack even higher. CRUSH brings you three modes of exciting short-burst puzzle gameplay:

THINK mode: Take a little time and consider what moves to make. Go for massive combos to rack up the best Block score.

REACT mode: Make moves quickly to keep stack low. Survive as long as possible.

CRUSH mode: The ultimate combination of speed and strategy. Go for both large combos and a long survival time.

Choose from 6 recharging powers to use as you please, with each slightly changing the strategy required to achieve maximum scores. The powers also provide a shield against an untimely death, but are destroyed in the process.

CRUSH also lets you select from 3 background color schemes to suit your needs.

CRUSH includes an innovative 4-way UI system and a minimalist art-style inspired by Propellerhead Software (Figure, Reason, Rebirth).
