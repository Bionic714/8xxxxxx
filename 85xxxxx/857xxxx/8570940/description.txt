Description:

As Lucifer's plan to kick-start the Armageddon blossoms its wicked fruit, these 13 new tales of terror peer into the lives of those both immediately and distantly affected by his diabolical scheme! Including a ruthless yet unsuspecting TV executive, a conniving rock star wannabe, a desperate abused teenager, a pair of star-crossed Mafioso lovers, and even the world's last ultra-hero who must choose - staying with the love of his life while the world goes to Hell (literally), or go fight the Great Cthulhu in a desperate (and most likely futile) attempt to save the remnants of humanity from being destroyed.
