Been looking for a recent version of this for a long while, finally found it elsewhere in the torrentsphere. Looks good, outside of the typical advert hyperlink shortcuts.

The instruction file is spaced weird, so you might want to copy/paste the text into wordpad instead of notepad to read more easily.

The main installation file is legit; the hashes match the version available for download at the official site.

The patch works, and appears clean. Need to run as admin for it to work, otherwise get a "unable to open file" error.  No negative side effects observed, and VirusTotal scan only shows a 2 / 47 ratio, with:

ESET-NOD32  -	a variant of Win32/Keygen.AN
Symantec - WS.Reputation.1


Both of which would be easy false positives:

Credits and BIG thanks go to TSRh TeaM for making this great program finally available.
