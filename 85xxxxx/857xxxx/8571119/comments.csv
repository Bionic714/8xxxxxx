,jsoudy,2013-06-14T03:01Z,Please review upon completion.
,TeribleSpeller,2013-06-14T03:34Z,"Exactly what nickweed said.

Thank you for organising and sharing this.  I positively thrive on fruits of other's OCD, bless your lopsided little hearts.

I probably will break down and get this in a few days, but I would be so much better to be able to seed and read if it were not zipped.

If its not a major inconvenience, would you consider reupping your New 52 folder without zipping it?"
,ocdreader,2013-06-14T15:21Z,as this was my first torrent I thought it may have been better to do it as a zip but yea i'll redo it. 
,ocdreader,2013-06-14T15:23Z,I just have to figure out how to update this torrent. :) 
,ocdreader,2013-06-14T19:04Z,I'm trying to delete this torrent but it's not letting me. Setting this as a ZIP was a horrible idea. I'm putting up the unzipped one now.
