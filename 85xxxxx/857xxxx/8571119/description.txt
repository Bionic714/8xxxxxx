This is all the New 52 plus some others like Constantine, Superman Unchained, and Injustice, that I could find through week 93. These are not mine. They have been pieced together from different locations. There are a multitude of people responsible for creating the individual CBR files. Ultron, Son of Ultron, Third Cousin of Ultron etc. etc. 

They are all in the same file format

Nice and clean. It's the OCD. What can I say? This is a huge file. Almost 30gb so I hope you have a good connection. 

I have not read all of them. I have read all of Injustice, and the Green Lantern et all ones. They are great quality on my Surface RT.
