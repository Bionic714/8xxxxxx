However there seems to be an issue with this one. Will re-download to check if that's where the problem is."
,TlanImass,2013-06-16T02:43Z,"@greembomc No. You're correct. It freezes at 07:04 and continues again at 08:19. The rest of the episode seems to run fine.

This is the only file I can find though. No other capper seems to have shared this one."
