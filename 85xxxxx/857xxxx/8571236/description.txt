Texas-Sized Operation

Chef Anne Burrell brings in four candidates for the executive chef job at Abels on the Lake, a 10,000 square foot restaurant in Austin, Texas. The chefs are tested of their use of local ingredients, as well as their ability to handle quantity and consistency. The final two chefs will not only handle dinner service, but also a special party in the restaurant's event space: One chef must re-work an entire dish at the last minute, while the other must overcome poor communication with the staff.
