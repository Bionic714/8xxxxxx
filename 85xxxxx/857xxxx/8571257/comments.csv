,bjornagainswede,2013-06-14T08:27Z,"Thanks for this...

Do you know if ACPIPlatfrom and IOPCIFamily kexts have been overwritten in this distro??? My board in a non Giga and would like to keep unnecessary KPs of the menu!"
,go6ovei,2013-06-14T18:32Z,"bjornagainswede-yes,need to be use rollback old kext's
Enjoy Hack"
,go6ovei,2013-06-14T18:37Z, bjornagainswede-Try AppleACPIPlatform.kext and IOPCIFamily.kext from 10.8 instead.
,bjornagainswede,2013-06-14T19:34Z,"Answered my question.. but in this case they need to be 10.6.8 and not 10.8... I don't get the spinner when booting if I use 10.8. I take it all my other kexts... ethernet/Audio etc all work with Mavericks too!,,, Looks good but hate how they kept mission control! As I have a multi monitor set up - this should be fun!"
,bjornagainswede,2013-06-15T11:27Z,"I can get the installer to run but BIG problem... It does not see any of my volumes so I cannot install!

I then copied the install to a 32Gb Flash with an 6 Gb Install Partition and a 24Gb PArtition... Installed very slowly and with 1 minute to go... Instal Fails???? No idea what is going on!

I had to totally replace your Extra Folder with my own... and overwrite the kext I mentioned (The Netkas fix) as that ncpi  fix does absolutely nothing on my machine!

Don't know why it will not see ANY of my volumes. I have 4 physical HDs and all of them bar one partition are HFS journaled,"
,bjornagainswede,2013-06-15T14:24Z,"Been up all night with this and it will NOT install for me so I am going to download a full preview...

It seems as if part of the installation is missing... I even tried finding the base installer which is nowhere to be found... tried opening the osinstal.mpkg with pacifist... I cannot,,, and finally installing it with MyHacks... likewise it points me to a file in core services saying its the wrong volume install information....

At least with the install ESD i'll have the full installer so thanks for your effort... but doesn't work for me!"
