,Catmeow,2013-06-14T01:00Z,"Hey, I'm a little confused on how you're allowing this to work. 1) Does this work from upgrading windows 7 -> 8? 
2) Why is there only the 1 code that you gave for online activation? Is that a code that has 20,000 uses or are there supposed to be 20,000 codes? 
3) Where do I go when I upgrade, can it just be through windows website? Here's the website I'm looking at and want to just hit ""Install"" then put in your serial you provided for online registration.

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-14T01:35Z,"Please disreguard online activation serial. Iforgot to remove it, it is no longer usable. All uses have been used. you will need to download my torrent of windows 8 pro here.

And it is done by reverse algorithm which is very time consuming. :) But not to bad when you get use to doing it on the same software all the time. Take care."
,Jamwa3,2013-06-14T02:27Z,hi how do you un-activate from ur activation and personaliser and use these serials because ur activation and personaliser has a few problems i jus want everything to work properly? 
,Catmeow,2013-06-14T02:46Z,"oh okay, thanks! I wasn't aware that you had the torrent available as a different thing. you should just link to it in the description, that way people like me don't feel as stupid. :p thanks though, i'll try it out and let you know. "
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-14T02:51Z,"Best way to go is to do a clean install..back up the stuff you need, and do a fresh install.

,SM-003,2013-06-14T20:18Z,"@Halloweenpsycho...

I've been watching your work from the first day & appreciate it very much. 

Thank you, just one request

please don't repeat the same key(s) again & again in your latest work as it's get mixed. please post after filtration from next time then it'd be really a good one."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-14T22:36Z,"@SM-003
That means a lot, and thank you very much for the constructive criticism. My pc recently went down, and i have been in the process of getting everything back to snuff on my end. And i will be sure to watch closely for duplicates as i normally do, please just bear with me through this mess and i will get new keys out to all of you asap. Thanks so much for your support and understanding. And thank you for the compliments and constructive criticism, Every comment from all of you i take into a great deal of consideration and i appreciate each of you for the support you have given me over the months, and i will continue to bring you the best uploads i can provide. Take care and Cheers. :) "
,yashie87,2013-06-15T10:44Z,"Hello, I appreciate the detailed instructions you have provided. However, I have been unsuccessful in getting my PC activated over phone.

1) I used one of the listed keys listed under the phone activation method using the slmgr.vbs -ipk command.

2) It took the product key and I attempted to activate by phone.

3) I am from India, I first tried the Indian toll free number. Entered the 9 sets of digits very carefully.

4) The IVR couldn't validate it stating that something went wrong.

5) I don't know if it is a problem with key or a problem with Indian activation phone line.

6) I don't know how to change the key. I ran the slmgr.vbs -ipk with new key in the list and it errored out.

7) I tried calling the US activation phone number through my regular phone (i dont have a headset/mic handy) displayed in the activation screen. The IVR couldn't activate it and tried to transfer to a live person, I disconnected the call.

Can you please suggest a way to activate this installation please? Can you may be email a key that will work for sure, so that I don't have to stay on an international call multiple times.

Thank you."
,SM-003,2013-06-15T23:37Z,"@Halloweenpsycho

Thanks...

just a query...

from where & how did you get those key(s)?"
,SM-003,2013-06-16T00:01Z,"@Halloweenpsycho

& in one thing I'd like to attract your attention...

As I go through each & every key by checking it's authenticity each time you posted, I've noticed a flaw this time that the second key of WMC is incomplete. The first set of that particular key contains only 4 digits instead of 5 (3FB8). Please check it & give the correct one."
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-16T00:55Z,"@SM-003
Reverse algorithm. "":) ad i will check on that wmc key as well..i had a slight accident today, and got hurt a concussion :( so i have to take it easy for a few days. But i will work o new serials in the mean time.Take care  "
