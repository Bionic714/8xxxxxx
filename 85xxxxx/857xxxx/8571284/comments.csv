There is NO SUCH PRODUCT as 2013 ""PRO PLUS"" RETAIL or enterprise or anything.

Never was, never will be.

Get over it.

Thank you"

,theloston3,2013-06-14T21:38Z,"MurphysLawyer is a spammer. Probably some MS Corp guy trying to reduce downloads. I downloaded this, followed the steps, activated, and I am here to verify that it works. Step 6D needs some clarification, the Installation ID can be found on the window that shows after selecting 'Active over phone' in the activation process. I used 'N3KJM-Q24M3-GM2HY-KQXYW-HMF29' and it worked, called the UK number and it worked, I'm from U.S., and set the Microsoft Office 2013 Country/Region to U.S. and it worked. Thanks Halloweenpsycho, keep it up."
