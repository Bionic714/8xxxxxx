[Fixed upload.  Not sure why it wasn't showing up properly before, but it seems to be fine now]

These aren't HD or anything fancy.
All episodes were collected right here from TPB.

The reason I've re-upped is because I've cleaned filenames, metadata tags, and done volume levelling across all files.  I had to convert some that were mp4 format into avi for consistency and to help with volume-levelling.

I'll bet you can find higher-resolution rips if you dig, but I can pretty much promise you these will be much better organized and much less of a hassle to sort through.

I recommend VLC for viewing.
If you insist on using WMP, make sure you get the K-Lite Media Codec packs first.
K-Lite is freeware and it's basically an essential part of any video lover's toolkit.
