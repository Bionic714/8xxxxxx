This is all the material I have downloaded in the past, created by The Handle.


You might not know him, but he is a "Sunvox purist", meaning he creates all of his electro music using only Sunvox, and some external samples as his tools.

Please note, that there isn't any sort of sorting involved on the files, what matters is that you can find whatever you need - early works and newer works alike.


Enjoy the music, spread the word! :)
