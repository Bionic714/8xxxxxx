It's the adaptation of the ""Fantastic Voyage"" movie - not the cartoon, but the one with Raquel Welch and everyone getting to fondle her boobs while pulling off tons of dried antibodies! - and it's probably listed as a Dell 4-Color title if that helps.

Either way, my thanks again for all the Hitlists. I await with anticipation the next 402 parts for this week alone...:) :) :):)"
,Dwch,2013-06-14T03:03Z,"Could someone please tell me where to find Before Watchmen Dr. Manhattan 01 (2012) (Zone-Empire) in HD? It seems like every issue of every Before Watchmen has been done/re-released in digital-HD except that one. I can find the first issue but it's only 1280px and does not ""match"" the rest of the set... ShipJ any pointers?"
