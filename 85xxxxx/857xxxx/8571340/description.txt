FUCK ELITISM AND PRIVATE COLLECTORS

DURING THE BLIND INTRO YOU CAN SEE SOME TAPE ISSUES THAT ARE NO PRESENT ON THE LOW-GEN VERSION, SO I HOPE THIS IS A TRUE UPGRADE FROM A NICER TAPE AND NOT A PROCESSED VERSION...

UNFORTUNATELY NEED TO, SHOOTS AND LADDERS AND FAGET AND THAT FUCKING SLOW MOTION EFFECT ARE STILL PRESENT
