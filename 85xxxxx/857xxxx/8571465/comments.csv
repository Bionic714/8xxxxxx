Trying to find a decent quality version of this movie, Id even settle for a half decent, watchable copy but I cant find one. This has been out for 14+ days and still not one good, watchable copy??? wtf??

If anyone has finished downloading this copy, please lemme know the a/v .... thanks."
,shartup,2013-06-14T04:13Z,so this is the best copy yet v/8 - a/3 for a cam the audio is in mono I think but very watchable

v-3/10

video is great! but the audio sucks!!! sounds like the cammer had the mic covered with his/her jacket or some shit.  

Totally watchable but it took some VLC audio tweaks.
 thanx xxxlavalxxx! great upload."

,BuLLeTs64,2013-06-15T22:43Z,Pretty decent copy. A-5/V-8. For about 5 minutes everyone speaks french but u don't miss anything. I recommend this torrent. 
,Calamakuya,2013-06-16T02:45Z,"Video watchable

A shame with the audio, tho."
