Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On this Thursday, June 13 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex continues to breakdown the NSA's massive surveillance grid and the Edward Snowden revelations with retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Shaffer, the intelligence officer who went public with the Able Danger controversy and had his memoirs, Operation Dark Heart, destroyed by the Pentagon. 

Alex also talks with Lieutenant-General Hamid Gul, a retired high-ranking general officer in the Pakistan Army, and a former spymaster famous for serving as the Director-General of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Gul and Jones talk about how intelligence runs al-Qaeda in Syria and are used to perpetuate a manufactured war on terrorism.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
