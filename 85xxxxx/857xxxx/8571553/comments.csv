,Trikyas,2013-06-14T11:22Z,"Having trouble with this part ::
Now  add new Serial
     901E-0190-XL1C-8PML-7P7Z-8H70-CL4Z-X129
 It should now say never expires.
 It says it is a ""non-licensed"" version??? 
I followed everything perfectly but this license isn't valid.... If it is something I'm doing wrong, then please help me out."

,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-14T18:45Z,"@Trikyas
you followed instructions as written? did you have a previous version of Nero installed?"
,CyrusWong,2013-06-14T20:13Z,"Just finish downloaded , installed and work perfectly , thanks Halloweenpsycho for everything :)

but there is a minor mistake guide in your readme.

this >>> 3. Install program by double clicking on ""Nero Platinume.exe""

there is no such file named Nero Platinume.exe
the correct file name should be ""Nero-12.5.01900_trial.exe"""
,Halloweenpsycho,2013-06-14T22:39Z,"@CyrusWong  thank you so much for the correction
please all be advised to take note to this typo on my part. Take care Cyrus, and thanks again :) Cheers. "
,ripprapp,2013-06-14T23:53Z,I had a previous version of Nero installed and couldn't install this version because of wrong serial. The trial was expired and 901E-0190-XL1C-8PML-7P7Z-8H70-CL4Z-X129 didn't work. Does anyone know what to do?
