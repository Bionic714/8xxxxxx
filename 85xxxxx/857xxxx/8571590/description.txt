The final Diana Ross & the Supremes' album before Ross' departure, a duet LP with the Temptations (the second for the two groups) came out the same month. This ragtag bunch of vault dwellers and passed over tunes written by the company's third and fourth tier writers and producers has a misleading title: there are few creams and it's a bad crop. The sole star is their scintillating remake of Johnny & Jackey's forgotten "Someday We'll Be Together" -- their last hurrah, and a few other honorable mentions, namely "The Young Folks" and "You Gave Me Love." Despite the shortcomings, it wrangled its way to number 33 on Billboard's Pop Chart.
