A sharp-witted knockdown of AmericaΓÇÖs love affair with positive thinking and an urgent call for a new commitment to realism

Americans are a ΓÇ£positiveΓÇ¥ peopleΓÇöcheerful, optimistic, and upbeat: this is our reputation as well as our self-image. But more than a temperament, being positive, we are told, is the key to success and prosperity.

In this utterly original take on the American frame of mind, Barbara Ehrenreich traces the strange career of our sunny outlook from its origins as a marginal nineteenth-century healing technique to its enshrinement as a dominant, almost mandatory, cultural attitude. Evangelical mega-churches preach the good news that you only have to want something to get it, because God wants to ΓÇ£prosperΓÇ¥ you. The medical profession prescribes positive thinking for its presumed health benefits. Academia has made room for new departments of ΓÇ£positive psychologyΓÇ¥ and the ΓÇ£science of happiness.ΓÇ¥ Nowhere, though, has bright-siding taken firmer root than within the business community, where, as Ehrenreich shows, the refusal even to consider negative outcomesΓÇölike mortgage defaultsΓÇöcontributed directly to the current economic crisis.

With the mythbusting powers for which she is acclaimed, Ehrenreich exposes the downside of AmericaΓÇÖs penchant for positive thinking: On a personal level, it leads to self-blame and a morbid preoccupation with stamping out ΓÇ£negativeΓÇ¥ thoughts. On a national level, itΓÇÖs brought us an era of irrational optimism resulting in disaster. This is Ehrenreich at her provocative bestΓÇöpoking holes in conventional wisdom and faux science, and ending with a call for existential clarity and courage.
