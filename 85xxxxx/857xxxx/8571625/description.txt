I.K.U. (pronounced ai-kei-ju, abbreviated as iku) is a 2001 independent film directed by Taiwanese-American experimental filmmaker Shu Lea Cheang. It was marketed as "a Japanese Sci-Fi Porn Feature". The film was partially inspired by Blade Runner (1982). I.K.U.'s premise involves a futuristic corporation sending shapeshifting cyborgs out into New Tokyo to collect "orgasm data" by means of sexual intercourse. The title is a pun on the Japanese word iku (ΦíîπüÅ) which, in sexual slang, is used to express an orgasm.

I.K.U. premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. It was the first pornographic film ever screened in the festival.
