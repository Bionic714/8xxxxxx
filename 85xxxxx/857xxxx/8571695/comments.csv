,baratheon,2013-06-14T04:38Z,"Well, sheesh, TheCKruse, I'm soooo sorry my torrent isn't good enough for you. I specified that it was the entirety of his /studio album/ discography, as well as a couple of extra live albums, a leaked album and a compilation. Just because I didn't include all of what you listed, that doesn't mean it's not a decent torrent and you could be less of a dick about it. I didn't see the point in including a ton of compilations most of them have the exact same songs on them as the actual studio albums. "
