Teleport Pro's big brother, Teleport Ultra, has Pro's intuitive interface and easy-to-use project-based design -- but it also has the ability to scan up to 260,000 addresses in a single project.  Like Teleport Pro, Teleport Ultra can handle multiple servers in a single project, dramatically improving its throughput.  Its larger database, however, allows it to handle much larger websites and more servers, enabling you to download much more information in a single project.  

Teleport Ultra is also an enhanced capability webspider, having exploration, filtering, and rewriting capabilities that Teleport Pro lacks.  Its enhanced abilities allow you to: 

- Use regular expressions to specify included as well as excluded areas to crawl 
- Specify domain aliases for crawling servers with multiple names 
- Borrow the browser's cookie cache, letting you perform complex authentication with your browser, and then crawl with Teleport 
- Inject custom HTTP headers into server requests 
- Synchronize your offline copy so that old files and orphans are automatically removed 
- Use customizable messages when rewriting links to unretrieved files 
- Control HTML markup and inject meta tags with original URL and retrieval date/time stamps 
- Can crawl HTTPS (secure) servers
