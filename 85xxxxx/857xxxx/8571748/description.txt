As a market leader, PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS is one of the most powerful brands in the physics market. While preserving concise language, state-of-the-art educational pedagogy, and top-notch worked examples, the Ninth Edition highlights the Analysis Model approach to problem-solving, including brand-new Analysis Model Tutorials, written by text co-author John Jewett, and available in Enhanced WebAssign. The Analysis Model approach lays out a standard set of situations that appear in most physics problems, and serves as a bridge to help students identify the correct fundamental principle--and then the equation--to utilize in solving that problem. The unified art program and the carefully thought out problem sets also enhance the thoughtful instruction for which Raymond A. Serway and John W. Jewett, Jr. earned their reputations. The Ninth Edition of PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WITH MODERN PHYSICS continues to be accompanied by Enhanced WebAssign in the most integrated text-technology offering available today.
