,diggersd,2013-06-14T01:57Z,can you put up mp4 or avi file please. i love this show im in thailand so would really appreciate cheers
,montej,2013-06-14T05:13Z,THANK YOU!!!! :D
,jc4321234,2013-06-14T11:44Z,"Hey diggersd, I won't be able to get them in mp4 or avi format. If I were to convert them to mp4 or avi it would destroy the quality. There are flv to avi converters that will convert it for you"
,AlyH,2013-06-14T12:46Z,or download vlc player to view flv format
,webmonk42,2013-06-14T13:15Z,smaller file size please
,jc4321234,2013-06-14T18:19Z,"webmonk, This copy of the show is smaller than the copy that someone uploaded after me. I could get a 360p version but the quality would be shit and then I'd have people complaining that the quality is shit. Either way someone is going to complain because that seems to be the thing to do on here.  I'm not gonna upload a separate copy of a show in bad quality just so 1 person can download it.  "
,webmonk42,2013-06-14T19:52Z,"thanks anyways, maybe someone will do the series in 480p like the 300mb movies StylishSalH does. "
