"It's pitch black, toxic gases bubble up from deep below, sulfuric acid drips from above, and carbon monoxide fills the air. It's not a scene from a horror movie, but the interior of a beautiful, but treacherous, cave. Explore the beauty and danger found in some of the world's most exotic caves as NOVA explores dark recesses, off limits to all except researchers."

Note: Wikipedia calls this episode S29E10 (all of their episode numbers seem to differ from here.)

The aspect ratio and resolution of the original DVD source were non-standard/letterboxed. I cropped out most of the letterboxing. The black bar at the bottom isn't erroneous; it is due to the program's overlays extending into the letterboxing so enough was left that they were not lost. The end credits' letters are slightly clipped at the top as the image goes to 4:3 fullscreen then.

Please seed to 100% or higher so that this torrent doesn't go the way of the others. My upstream isn't the fastest (max. about 50kBps) so be patient and you'll get your file.
If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
