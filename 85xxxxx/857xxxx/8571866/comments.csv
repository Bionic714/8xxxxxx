,deevotraw,2013-06-17T00:47Z,@Ayrus_Zed many of them are available on TPB ..Just do a quick search or use google :)
,Ayrus_Zed,2013-06-17T05:50Z,"@deevotraw - I didnt post this request before a high profile research, NONE are available

None are available, and even if they are its on file sharing sites like heroturko etc and our country dosent have high speed internet and even if we do manage, 99% of the links are dead

PS - I crafted a High Profile Pentagon Category 7 Research before posting this request :-P

@magicmortimer - Please do find and upload these if and when you find them please
thanks a lot in advance
Enjoy n Cheers:-)
