It still shows 0 seeders even though I just made and uploaded the torrent and it's there in uTorrent, supposedly seeding but the TPB doesn't update?"

,dragancla,2013-06-15T00:02Z,"Pretty much, yes :) 

Here's a list of all the DLCs: http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_III_downloadable_content

If you can check the info provided, all of them are there (I think). Too bad only magnet links work, you could download just the DLCs off the pack if you had the game allready installed :)"
