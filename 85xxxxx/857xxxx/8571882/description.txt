FEATURES:

This is a compilation of a lot of stuff I struggled with while trying to play the full game so I decided to help any other lost soul and made this torrent.

Basically it helps you install a custumized AC3. This is the torrent for you if:
- You want to install and play the original released game (Reloaded version);
- You want to play on patch 1.05;
- You want to play the Deluxe version of the game;
- You want to play The Tyranny of King George Washington first, second or third DLC;
- ANY COMBINATION OF ANY AND ALL OF THE ABOVE!
