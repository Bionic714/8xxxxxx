THIS IS A REPACKED VERSION OF YESTERDAY'S TORRENT.
This version includes a better launcher, updated FSPort, among other things!

Full Freespace 2 with all popular campaigns. Blue Planet included.
SCP 3.7.0 offers new graphical features, less bugs, and greater stability.

UNPACK WITH WINRAR INTO YOUR GAMES FOLDER.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Open up FS2 wxlauncher. Go to "Basic Settings" and find your Freespace 2 folder. Select "fs2_open_3_7_0_RC2" to play Freespace 2 and other mods, or "fs2_open_3_6_19_SSE2_BP" SPECIFICALLY if you want to play Blue Planet.

2. Go to Mods tab, and select mod 

"3.6.12 Media_VP" to play Freespace 2 with upgraded graphics.
FSPort-MediaVP to play Freespace 1 with upgraded graphics and soundtrack.
FSPort-STR is an expansion to Freespace 1.
Blue Planet/Blue Planet 2 to play the great community created campaign which feels like Freespace 3. 
JAD is another good (parody) mod to play for laughs.

3. Make sure your Video, Audio, and Joystick settings are what you want them to be. You can also customize Text-to-speech settings.

4. Go to Advanced Settings tab. Enable the following...

In Graphics:
Apply Lighting to missiles
Enable 3D Shockwaves
Enable Post Processing
Enable Soft Particles
Enable FXAA

In HUD:
Add another pair of scanning lines
Enable info next to target
Enable 3D Radar
Enable rearm/repair completion timer
Enable analog ballistic ammo gauge

In Gameplay:
Use 3D Models for ship selection
Use 3D Models for weapons selection
Enable 3D Warp
Enable Flash upon warp

In Experimental:
Enable Framebuffer Shockwaves

*disable the framebuffer shockwaves if you're having crash problems

SELECT "BASELINE RECOMMENDED" UNDER LIGHTING PRESETS (on the right side).
This will provide overall improved lighting options.

5. Launch Game. Create a new pilot and type in a callsign.

6.Go to Options ingame, and turn all the graphics to maximum. Turn up the mouse sensitivity to maximum. You can customize your flight controls, as well as your HUD to your liking (recommended).

For controls, I recommend binding these keys:
W for Acceleration
S for Deceleration
A for Bank Left
D for Bank Right
Space for Afterburner
Mouse Right Click for Launch Missles
Mouse Left Click for Primary weapons
Mouse Middle Click for Switch weapons

7. Go to Campaigns and make sure the Campaign you want to play is loaded. For Blue Planet, play Age of Aquarius first, War in Heaven Part 1 as second, and War in Heaven Part 2 last. There are bonus campaigns for some mods. "Kill Everything" campaign can be ignored (it was my own creation).

8. Don't forget to seed this great game!
Thanks! 

ENJOY!
