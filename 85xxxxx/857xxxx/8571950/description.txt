Town with Nicholas Crane Series 2

Sociopolitical Documentary hosted by Nicholas Crane, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Nicholas Crane visits towns across the United Kingdom, revisiting the history of urban life in the British Isles. More intimate than a city, towns are where we first learned to be urban. Harbour towns, market towns, island towns, industrial towns: collectively they bind our land together.


1)  Oban 
Gateway to the spectacular beauty of the Western Isles, the port of Oban is a major rail terminal and ferry port, but is it anything more? Geographer and adventurer Nicholas Crane looks behind the transit-lounge image to find a town with a dramatic past, including a surprising role in the Cold War of the 1960s and a world of adrenalin-fuelled adventure, great seafood, and inspiring scenery.

2)  Saffron Walden 
An attractive market town within easy commuting distance of London, Saffron Walden has some of the best preserved medieval architecture in the country. However its heritage is now under threat. Nicholas Crane discovers what gave this town its unique name and how the UK's housing crisis is affecting its future.

3)  Huddersfield 
A Yorkshire mill town with a history of rugby, rebellion, and high-quality cloth, Huddersfield is a hidden gem.

4)  Enniskillen 
The most westerly town in the UK, Enniskillen is surrounded by beautiful lakes, is busy with independent shops, and attracts forward-thinking entrepreneurs. But its serene way of life is under threat from plans for underground gas exploitation.
