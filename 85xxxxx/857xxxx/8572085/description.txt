ISBN: 0762778563 | 2012 | EPUB

For anyone who craves a meaningful life, A Field Guide To Now is an invitation to begin. Through evocative prose and original illustrations, Christina Rosalie inspires readers to find passion and purpose by attending to the moment at hand.

Every self-help book tells us to ΓÇ£be present,ΓÇ¥ but few succeed in showing us how. With this book, Christina leads readers to discover how the small and seemingly mundane aspects of daily life canΓÇöthrough a shift in focusΓÇöbecome a springboard for the profound. It is an antidote to the perpetual rush we experience daily; and to that feeling that there will never be enough time to begin, to commit to a creative practice, or to become whatever it is we want most to be.

Part adventure guide and part survival guide, A Field Guide To Now is filled with thought starters and creative exercises that will lead you to uncover your own extraordinary life amidst the ordinary moments of every day. It will make you laugh. It will make your heart sing. It will give you a reason to pause. Above all else, this book is call to take action, to live wholly into the present, and to persist in becoming whatever your heart yearns to be.
