An early work interpreting the gospel of Mark through the lens of Girard's mimetic theory.

In six lucid chapters, the author displays a remarkable perspective on the inner workings of the Markan text. Taking the account of the cleansing of the Temple as his starting point, he describes the relation in Mark of the Sacred, violence, the scapegoat, and also the poetics of faith.
