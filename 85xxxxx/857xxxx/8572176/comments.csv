You can ""acquire"" the soundtrack here ( https://www.quaddicted.com/files/music/quake_music.zip ) and you can install the unofficial 3.24 patch ( http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/downloads/quake2-3.24-win32.zip ). After you install the unofficial 3.24 patch, extract quake_music.zip to baseq2/music.
You will need to rename the files like this: track002.ogg becomes track02.ogg, track001.ogg becomes track01.ogg, etc."
