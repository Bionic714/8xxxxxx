Greetings,
this is the official and unchanged Arimaa Program (v2.0) by David Fotland which plays by the handle 'bot_bomb' at the site http://www.arimaa.com

You can download it at http://www.smart-games.com/arimaa.html

It is already virus checked with VirusTotal.
( you can see the last analyse at http://www.virustotal.com/de/file/60c473611b794904b8c3dae62102887221ec66d58dd6907899482f6dfa8b6b52/analysis/ )

To unlock the full version of this great game you have to insert these values ( without the apostrophes ) :
-------------------------------------------------------
Full Name: ""  [empty string]
e-mail Address: ""  [empty string]
Registration Code: "S2lNoKQK"  [the third letter is a lowercase "L"]
-------------------------------------------------------
(just copy&paste the code into the text-box which pops up when you open menu: "File" -&gt; "Register...")

Have fun! (and maybe see you at arimaa.com :)


PS:
as this is just the Reg.code, seeding is only important in the case the developer site takes the download link down, so please do seed and comment if you like it :)

PPS: anyone who is interested in getting his name registered or making a proper keygen for this (i was too lazy :), can ask me here and i give you the adress-location of the output of the true reg.code (for OllyDbg-1.10), but this is only for purists, the program will run fine with just the above credentials
