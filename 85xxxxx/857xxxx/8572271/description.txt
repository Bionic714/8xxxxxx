The Essential Drucker (2001), by Peter Drucker.

Over a career that spanned nearly 60 years before he died in 2005 at age 95, Peter Drucker single-handedly invented the field of management theory. For most of the last half of the 20th century, he was the superstar CEO's go-to guru, counseling everyone from Alfred Sloan to Andy Grove. And not in the fuzzy-headed, inspirational, bromide-spouting guru sense you see today. Drucker had no time for discussing who moved your cheese, and his insights were distinctive for being simultaneously crystalline yet deeply contrarian ΓÇö and, frequently, a generation ahead of their time. Just one example: He was talking about the rise and importance of "knowledge workers" in the 1970s, when the phrase was a good two decades from common parlance. With 30 books to choose from, it's probably best to start with The Essential Drucker, a potent 26-piece collection selected by Drucker himself in 2001 as a comprehensive representation of his life's work. 


Note by uploader: The same book was uploaded by a PB user with username "Qwerty80". That book had non-readable formatting. It was without any headings, paragraphs, bullet points and anchor texts. 

I've spent a whole day just to clean it up and make it readable. I want to thank "Qwerty80" for the availability of this book. It's a must read for anyone interested in Business, Economy, Sociology etc
