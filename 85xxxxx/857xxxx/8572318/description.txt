Info:
Minecraft is about placing blocks to build things and going
on adventures!
Pocket Edition includes randomly generated worlds,
multiplayer over a local Wi-Fi network, and Survival and
Creative modes. You can craft and create with your friends
anywhere in the world so long as you have hands spare and
battery to burn.
Our most recent update added the iconic Creepers.
Theyâ™re big, green, mean and explody. But itâ™s just
one of many. Since Minecraft — Pocket Edition first
appeared, weâ™re continuing to add loads of new
features, including...
- Food! Now you can cook and go hungry
- Swords! Bows! TNT!
- Chests
- Skeletons
- Spiders
- Beds
- Paintings
- Lots more!


Instructions:
Just install the apk file and play the game.
