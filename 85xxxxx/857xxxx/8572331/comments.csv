,dangLz101,2013-06-14T09:40Z,I usually get my Hannibal on from this provider and haven't had any issues this season until this episode. All I'm getting is sound. I'm using vLc media player. Any ideas on what might be happening?

Works fine here, also on VLC. Try to adjust your preferences under the ""Video"" tab.

Thx ettv, you guys are the best, will be seeding for a week or so."
