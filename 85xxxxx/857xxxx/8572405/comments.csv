Any bugs, questions or comments should be directed to him as he created this wonderful work of God! ;)

,XXFawkes,2013-06-15T14:54Z,"Hello, please anyone tell me if You too have only 1 region [Cape Trinity] ?

I've seen that Update 1.4 fixes:
""- Abandon cities & regions is fixed""

I updated to 1.4 and then to 1.5 and I still have only 1 region. How to add more regions?"
,henriax,2013-06-15T16:31Z,"@XXFawkes I also have only 1 region (trinity), even though I updated to 1.5 :/

Also, I have 2 cities and I can't interact with my other city. It just shows as needed simoleons, 0 population, 0 simoleons and can't get any commuters :/ 

Help please."
