.: Plot :.
Secret agent Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) just received a burn notice -- a statement that a spy is unreliable and has been effectively fired -- for unknown reasons. Now, Westen must find out who issued the notice and why they did it without being able to use the resources and contacts he once had at his disposal.

While searching for answers, Weston receives help from Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar), an ex-IRA agent and Michael's ex-girlfriend and Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), a former Navy SEAL skilled in surveillance. And then there's Madeline (Sharon Gless), Westen's overbearing mother who is unaware of her son's profession.

Created and written by Matt Nix, Burn Notice combines a mixture of action and a fresh sense of humor that combined result in a new breed of spy.
