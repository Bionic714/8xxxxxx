Ending with the fall of the capital city to the British Army, the campaign for Philadelphia set in motion a series of events, that led to the defeat of the British and eventual independence for the emerging American nation.

From the landing of Howe's army at the head of the Elk River in Maryland, to his eventual capture of Philadelphia, the campaign included some fascinating battles. The first engagement at Brandywine, the inconclusive battle of the Clouds, the controversial Paoli Massacre, the missed opportunity at Germantown, and the maturing of an army at Valley Forge, are all examined in detail by Justin Clement, with supporting maps, original artwork, and photographs.

Recently discovered information about the battle of Brandywine and analysis of the major personalities involved, completes this comprehensive account of an important episode in the American War of Independence (1775-1783).
