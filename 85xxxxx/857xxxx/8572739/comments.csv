,dawidoos,2013-06-15T19:20Z,"Don't think so, no."
,AlcatrazSVK,2013-06-16T15:32Z,"hax99: Yes, you will be able to play it just fine with HD 7970 as it's on par with GTX680 +/-."
,hax99,2013-06-16T17:08Z,"Just got it and 2 min in I got the Drunken camera, did I launch the game wrong? Also do you have to activate the textures, I don't see that big of a difference between my rig and my ps3... the ps3 actually looks more real, this GTA looks to sharp, objects seem to pop out to much, but great work on the installer, really easy install."
