,tacosnack,2013-06-16T03:35Z,"Totally fake, just like bad216's other torrent of Fashionably Late. Both are the same standard version from the YouTube rip that has been floating around for days. Both torrents download to 85% and stall out, completing the standard version but missing the bonus tracks. Both have the same drop in audio quality during ""Fashionably Late"" and ""Alone"" that is in the YouTube rip as well. Nice title on the remix too. Super cute. Avoid this one."
,bad216,2013-06-16T04:33Z,dude wtf ever ur full of shit
,tacosnack,2013-06-16T15:10Z,The seed:leech ratio speaks for itself.
