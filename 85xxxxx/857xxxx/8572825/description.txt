What you will learn:
Photoshop has long been a pioneer in the realm of 2D image editing. But what happens if we need to incorporate some type of a 3D model into our image?

Well with the help of Photoshop CS6 Extended, we now have the ability to handle this entire pipeline all right inside of Photoshop. From materials to lighting and rendering, this tutorial will teach you how to perform each step inside of Photoshop.

Weâ€™ll get started by learning how to use the Vanishing Point filter to influence our perspective camera. Next we will learn how to import, scale and position all of the geometry for our scene. Next we will break down materials in Photoshop learning how we can quickly assign them to our various pieces of geometry.

To wrap this training up, we will learn about different methods of lighting our scene. First we will learn how to implement image based lighting using a linear workflow. Weâ€™ll then learn how we can manually create and place lights in our scene to help illuminate our objects in a way that makes them look like they are part of the image.

After watching this tutorial, you will be well equipped to begin importing your own geometry into Photoshop and merging it into still images.
