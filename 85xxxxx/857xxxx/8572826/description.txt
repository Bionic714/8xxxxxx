=========================================


I've created this torrent to help share one of my all-time favorite children's movies; the 1984 animated version of the Velveteen Rabbit.

Since this was dubbed onto DVD via my original VHS copy it obviously is not in high-definition. 
However, I can definitely do some post-processing to the audio to help clean up any analog noise if anyone wants me to.
