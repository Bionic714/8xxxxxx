[sigh] you know, I'm torn between whether we're better off if Card's works are pirated so he'll get shafted out of any royalties he demands per book sold, or if he's just cast aside and he and his drivel are forgotten altogether. 

...About the only argument I can make in the case of the former is that ""Mein Kampf"" is still in print even though the little flatulent paperhanger who authored it most certainly isn't making one shiekel to grub with from it, and keeping it in print just helps future generations learn from this particular favorite buggerboy of Satan's example was that sometimes eugenics needs a boost by eliminating authors of crap like ""Mein Kampf"" from the Gene Pool.

...In any case, I guess one could split the difference: download the book and then delete the file, thus claiming a moral victory of sorts over Card and his bigotry. YMMV, natch."
