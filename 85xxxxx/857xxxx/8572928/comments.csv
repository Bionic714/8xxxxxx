,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T00:00Z,There is nothing wrong with this video. Kilroy222 is a nut job and an idiot.
,Garyhall,2013-06-15T00:29Z,Bite me Kilroy222! Your word means nothing. This video is fine.
,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T00:40Z,"And Kilroy222, ""You are the only one who has an issue"" And the avi and mp4 were encoded with 2 different programs to boot. Quit spreading your bullshit and just fix your computer or codec pack."
,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T00:41Z,"And since when does a video buffer while playing on your own computer. LOLOlzzzzz. That would be watching a streaming video online when it would buffer. If your video buffers on your computer in your media player, ""FIX YOUR F_KIN COMPUTER!"""

,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T01:58Z,"Well, ""at least you have it"" until or if an HD version is available. There is a couple other eps on this show that are screen captures, jumpy, out of sync and incorrect aspect ratio because a good one was never uploaded. Sorry it is SD and not HD."
