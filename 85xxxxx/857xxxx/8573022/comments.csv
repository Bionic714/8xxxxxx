,storm2012,2013-06-14T21:27Z,"Thanks for the heads up kilroy222, hopefully one of the trusted U/L's will soon add a better copy.
Not going to D/L"
,chucktuna,2013-06-14T22:47Z,"I don't understand... other than the vid quality being a little low, I had no problem at all with this.  Is it maybe your buffer size is set too low?  I admit I don't have a lot of knowledge about most video files, but it seems like you might be scaring some for no real reason?!?  Please let me know if I'm wrong.  All anon uploads are not bad folks... otherwise it wouldn't be allowed.

,2B4GR8,2013-06-14T23:42Z,What an idiot. Buffering while playing on your own computer. Looks like you need some help on your system and a little knowledge. There is nothing wrong with this video. It is SDTV and good quality. Kilroy222 your a bonehead.
,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T00:03Z,There is nothing wrong with this video. Kilroy222 is a nut job and an idiot.

,Garyhall,2013-06-15T00:28Z,Kilroy222 has always been a complete idiot!
,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T00:34Z,"And Kilroy222, ""You are the only one who has an issue"" And the avi and mp4 were encoded with 2 different programs to boot. quit spreading your bullshit and just fix your computer or codec pack."
,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T00:37Z,"And since when does a video buffer while playing on your own computer. LOLOlzzzzz. That would be watching a streaming video online when it would buffer. If your video buffers on your computer in your media player, ""FIX YOUR F_KIN COMPUTER!"""
,2B4GR8,2013-06-15T01:56Z,"Well, ""at least you have it"" until or if an HD version is available. There is a couple other eps on this show that are screen captures, jumpy, out of sync and incorrect aspect ratio because a good one was never uploaded. Sorry it is SD and not HD."
,Mastodonkey,2013-06-15T02:08Z,"I downloaded this and was just about to jump back on here and rip kilroy but it looks like the justice has already been done..  the quality isn't great but ATLEAST SOMEBODY UPLOADED THE DAMN SHOW, WHATS THE DEAL? WHY CAN'T ANYBODY CONSISTENTLY UPLOAD AMERICAN PICKERS?"
,beechyboy,2013-06-15T15:15Z,"Amen brother! 

Looks like there isn't any consistent cappers for this show. "
,idk420,2013-06-16T04:16Z,*shrugs* didnt work for me
,2B4GR8,2013-06-16T10:50Z,R U serious. I upload lots of videos all done same way and nobody ever has any issues. try downloading the avi file or fix your codec pack or system.
