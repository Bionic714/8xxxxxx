The first part of this book is just a bunch of chess puzzles(some really interesting ones) with annotations authour Gik). Once in a while Karpov throws in some endgame wisdom such as triangulation(losing the tempo) and the rule of the square which might be of interest to the beginner. 
There is a section (letter) about the best games from the World Championships.(from Steinitz until Karpov)There is also a letter on Karpov's best games and a story on how he met his co-author Gik. The book is written as a set of letters and Karpov may want the book to look letter-like. 
There is an outdated section on computer chess. Its rather amusing to read the naive predictions(from the 80s) of how computers will never beat a grandmaster. Now computers are thrashing grandmasters 6 piece endgames perfectly.
