A bit about the album:
This album has been a long time coming, ever since their smash hit "Ode To The Bouncer" I've been following this band's long journey to this debut album and while many tracks I've had around already as they released them to the public, the new ones make this amazing band even more amazing. I highly recommend you check them out :-)




From Last.fm:
Studio Killers. No one knows where they came from; one day they were just here staring back at us through our high definition flat screens. They are however an electronic music collective comprised of Cherry, Goldie Foxx and Dyna Mink - virtually based in East London.

Cherry, the lead vocalist, remains an elusive character, someone her co-members Goldie Foxx and Dyna Mink describe as slightly scary. To our knowledge she seems to have shamelessly flirted the pants off ΓÇÿthe rightΓÇÖ people, (mostly figuratively but we wouldnΓÇÖt put it past her literally) and made her way into pop consciousness with her candy and grit style lyrics and look. The Studio Killers concept seems to be based on visual and aural pleasure and promises much more of such pleasure to come.

Ode To The Bouncer is the first single from Studio Killers. The songΓÇÖs inception came about when the producer/DJ duo Foxx and Mink started hunting a vocal topline for one of their backing tracks and their manager, the heavy weight Bipolar Bear, sent the track off to the illusive songwriter, Cherry. Everyone that came into contact with the resulting song thought it was a smash, and the lead vocals haunted them with the question: ΓÇ£WhoΓÇÖs that girl?ΓÇ¥
