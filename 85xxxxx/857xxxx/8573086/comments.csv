,misha553,2013-06-14T14:07Z,"U dont know winrar? it have ages since the first version xD.

Its a folder or it can be a file, in this case folder (.minecraft) compressed to reduce size with WinRar.
This is the programm http://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0 its free. Happy gaming!"
,misha553,2013-06-14T14:10Z,"It have NEI (Not Enought Items) wich its better than TMI. This includes the feature to read all recipes of any item! To view a recipe type ""R"" while putting the mouse cursor on the item."
,BroDude,2013-06-14T16:01Z,I get it working and everything but just want to know how to install the mods? Do I need MC Patcher? Can I have all the mods installed once I install them?
,misha553,2013-06-15T00:10Z,"The mods are allready installed just launch minecraft from ""minecraft launcher.exe"" i doesnt matter if u put .minecraft in roaming folder, its portable u can execute minecraft from any folder :)

Dont install mc patcher or Optifne it will mess up your mods!! Unfourtunaly when u have minecraft with 30 mods or more this two modifications cause several problems like missing textures or icons not showing in NEI. So... DONT install mc patcher or Optifine if u want to play minecraft with several mods like my pack.

Heres a pick of the menu. 50 mods loaded, 50 mods active http://bayimg.com/JANcOAAEE"
