This rar contains Minecraft 1.5.2 with 50 mods and the texture pack of BDcraft x128 with the correspondient patch of the mods included.

I updated this rar with mayor bugs fixes (basic components now work as intented and icons of the mod in NEI and creative shows correctly) and aditional maps deleted in order to decrease download time. Just one minor bug that is imposible to fix for version 1.5.2 for now (names of the items of basic components shows as "umnamed") but the recipes and all the content works perfect. This will be fixed when the modder of Universal Electricity or "UE" release basic components fully compatible with 1.5.2 or not (xD) i hope so.. 

Dont forget to create a shortcut for the minecraft launcher located in: AppDataRoaming.minecraftminecraft launcher
To change the language go to "opciones" and select "idioma"

If u find some other bugs and have the solution share it with the community :)


Enjoy and seed!!
