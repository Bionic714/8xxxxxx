Steve Reynolds' freshman set "Exile" is a good collection of folk-flavored tracks. His voice most reminds me of Steve Forbert, expressive with just a hint of a rasp to give character. The band gives his songs excellent backing. "Dear Rose" is an excellent track with Reynolds' finger-style guitar starting the track as a folk melody before the band breaks into the Springsteen-like booming chorus, "My load got light, Heroes for a time, Dear Rose for life." "That Old Love" has a lovely melody with Reynolds painting sonically & lyrically, "Could you bring back that old love so I can stay awhile?" "Miner's Lamp" is another strong track with minimal acoustic backing allowing Reynolds' voice to paint a tale of loss, "What lays in the woods is just the memory of a scream, the creek runs on but you're lost in this dream." "Painter & Son" has a simple but beautiful melody with an instrumental build and Reynolds' vocals somewhere between James Blunt and Nick Drake. The CD concludes with the title track, "Nowhere now, this ain't no place I know; Closer now to where it is I want to go." "Exile" is a good solid folk-pop effort by a promising musician. Enjoy!
