PLOT: A vacuous model (Deb) and a top-notch larger-size attorney (Jane) are killed at the same time.  When the model arrives in heaven she remonstrates in the reception area, pushes a 'return' button on a keyboard and is sent back to earth, but into the body of the attorney.  She retains her own personal memories, but gains the legal knowledge of the lawyer, and must now face the world in a new oversized body and with a totally different set of values.

Please see IMDB for episode details.

At the conclusion of season 4, the show's network Lifetime announced it was axing this excellent series.  Following public outcry and some negotiation this decision was overturned, with season 5 commencing on June 23 2013.  This torrent is to help those discovering the show for the first time to catch up on what they've missed.

These files were originally shared with two audio tracks, Russian and English, with Russian as the default.  Removing the Russian track was a large and time-consuming task due to the way the files had originally been formatted.  My thanks though to the original uploader.

I have also included some additional short videos containing interviews with cast members and other snippets from the period between seasons 1 and 2.
