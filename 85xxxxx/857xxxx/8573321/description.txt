Punchy, easy access, high energy pop rock with massive hooks and anthemic choruses that just won’t get out of your head - The Spin has every new crowd singing along before the middle eight, and always leaves them shouting for more.

 


With two successful club tours in Europe and the UK, The Spin are a growing phenomenon, turning heads and establishing themselves as a formidable live act with truly global commercial potential.

 


Hailing from Stockholm, The Spin consist of powerful vocals by Erik

Holmberg, driven brilliantly by Fredrik Askenström's guitar playing

and powered along by the energy-packed duo of Christoffer Ahl on drums and Mattias Ohlsén on bass. Flawless, four-part vocal harmonies carry brilliantly radio friendly songs, finely tuned for maximum clout and minimum ego.
