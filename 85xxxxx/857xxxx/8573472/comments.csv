,radiobbc,2013-06-14T15:11Z,"134. The Story of Salvo

This episode is all about the story of a hardcore punk rock band from London. Listen, and you'll hear an interview with the band members as they talk about how the band started, their influences, and what caused the band to end.

The band is called Salvo. They started in London in 2002 and played gigs in London, Oxford and Manchester before breaking up 4 years later. This interview was done recently. For the first time in years, most of the members of the group were all in the same room at the same time, so I had to take the opportunity to interview them for Luke's English Podcast"
