AAAAA - Editor's AVN's Highest Rating Julie and Steve are one happily married couple. In other words, the dinner banter is more sparkling than the pillow talk. Along comes a provacative book in an interesting little shop, and as fast as you can say "Kama Sutra", their existence is magically transformed into a passionate melange of fantasy and flesh. Turn the page on everything you know. A new chapter is written.
