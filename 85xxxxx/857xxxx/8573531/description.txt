The .ISO download is intended to be burned to a blank DVD-R of 4.4GB. Use the freeware ImgBurn app to burn the DVD. Or any other burner app, such as Nero, will work just as well. Just be sure to set the format to UDF ver2.50 or higher. Then the disc can be played on any external Blu-Ray console connected to a big screen HDTV, with full Dolby 5.1 surround sound. Lately the blank media costs about 20 cents and should last for 20 years. So give it a try. 

However, if just you want to play the video on your PC you can use a freeware virtual DVD emulator utility, like DAEMONToolsLite, to mount the ISO as a temporary drive. You will also need a Blu-Ray compatible Media Play app. Use the freeware DAPlayer or VLC Media Player from VideoLAN to play the video.

If you want the actual video file to re-encode for a different target, just copy it out of the folder structure of the disc. The file name is 00000.m2ts and found at BDMV-&gt;STREAM. To encode for a different machine use the freeware encoder HandBrake for PC or MAC.
