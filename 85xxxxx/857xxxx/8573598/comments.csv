,privateer2day,2013-06-15T18:29Z,"1922 book on electrostatics. A good reference. 

When this book was published in 1922, the peak of electrostatic influence-machine development had already been reached, and this book is probably the most comprehensive ever written on the subject. The book includes descriptions of many electrostatic devices, including Kelvin’s Leyden jar and electrical influence machines designed by Cavallo, Belli, Bleekrode, Bonetti, Ghilarducci, Holtz, Lemström, Pidgeon, Schall, Toepler, Tudsbury, Wimshurst, Wommelsdorf, and many machines built by the author.

The author also includes accounts of his own experiments, as well as a chapter on electrostatic motors such as Crooke’s tube motor and Avery’s electrostatic motor. A true encyclopedia, this volume is an absolute must for anyone interested in static machines."
