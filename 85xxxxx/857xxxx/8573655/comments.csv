if you want to share your uploads then it is fine by us.

If you however are uploading in order to cash in using image hosts with popups/etc then you are not welcome here.

If you want a image host then TPB runs one and it is free:

http://bayimg.com/

another one, clean and free:

http://imgbox.com

If you try to go around blocks you will soon find your account banned with all your torrents removed."
