Excuse me for my English i know its suck :P




Nexus Media Importer allows you to stream and transfer music, video, photos and 

documents from a USB flash drive or card reader connected to your Nexus 7, Nexus 

10, 

Galaxy Nexus, Xoom or other Android 4.0+ devices with USB Host support. See 

technical 

notes for a list of supported file types and file systems. This is the only non-

root 

solution for devices that do not provide native support for external storage.

To use:

If you are using a card reader, put the flash memory card in the reader first.

Attach your USB device to the OTG cable.

Attach the OTG cable to the Nexus or other device.

The application should launch automatically.

Photos can be browsed by selecting from the list then swiping back and forth.

Videos can be streamed with the Play icon.

The Advanced tab can be used to manage and transfer files.

Use the Connect screen to determine the viewed device and the destination device 

for 

the Copy/Move operation
