[V],globeplus,2013-06-14T17:07Z,"Hi nice new movies fans and this is the only cam for the moment for this new movie and the video is acceptable with ocasionally little interferences during the movie with people standing up or just small black screens on the picture , the audio is a spanish dub that sounds acceptable , of course that i hope a better cam soon as possible and probably in english not because is in spanish but because the random insuficiences make the viewer wish for a general better cam shooting respecting anyway the effort from who shoots this cam ... see all of you around and happy movies ..."
,sharaz_ali,2013-06-14T17:21Z,thanks for the effort globeplus....

,tflagger997,2013-06-14T19:32Z,61Zone - @400MB does it really matter?  This is not a movie you want to watch on an iPhone.
,Satafakap,2013-06-14T19:48Z,"For a cam:
A5V5
Can't understand spanish language"
,tflagger997,2013-06-14T19:52Z,"Just checked reviews and this is all CG.  Well, everything not CG tends to suck, so you *really* want a copy that gets close to HD if you want to enjoy it.

Really surprised that they managed to (partially) screw up another Superman movie without putting Michael Bay in charge.  This is directed by Nolan, which is probably why this is Dark Superman, instead of fun, happy-go-lucky Superman.  With the PG rating though, it cannot be too Dark.  Too bad, would have been a nice change."
,vgls38,2013-06-14T20:28Z,"Propably fake...it says 1 hr 36 min 
the real runtime of the movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes."
,Honor07,2013-06-14T21:09Z,"This is a legit copy, I finished downloading it about an hour ago.

Its a bit blurry and pixellated and in dub spanish as the description says.

Heard great things about this movie, should probably wait for a much better cam version or see it in theatres.

Also its about an hour and 40 minutes, but other sources say the actual movie is about two hours and half hours.

Going to watch it now, Peace."
,payaso13,2013-06-14T21:33Z,Glad im Mexican cause im enjoying it  thanks globeplus  Muchas gracias vato loco LOL
,IAMGOD17,2013-06-14T21:41Z,no mames.....pinche mierda guey....estas loco....try again this time in english
,ghostkernel,2013-06-14T21:53Z,"Pelicula no esta completa,le falata un pedazo al ultimo,se ve decente el video pero se mueve demasiado la camara. no les recomiendo k lo descarguen..

Not complete,quality is watchable but camera moves to much and makes it impossible to watch, it is the legit movie but is missing a chunk in the end."
,1di0t,2013-06-14T22:17Z,"I do known it's not easy, but it would be great to have a trusted/VIP piratebay member posting MAN OF STEEL, the full version of it, since this ends almost 1 hour before it should. Runtime : 2h26m 
This torrent runtime : 1h39m .

Thx for getting the movie out here so soon, but try to get a full version of it for all of us that want to see the movie, but can't because it haven't aired yet in my country... "
,notdone23,2013-06-14T22:18Z,"Its watchable of your desperate to see it early. And like some people have already mentioned A rather large chunk at the end is missing. The camera is obscured by something every one in a while, or the guy movies the camera and you see the bottom half or top half of the film. Gonna have to wait for another version to come out that's complete. "
,bobbo_nut,2013-06-14T23:29Z,tflagger appears to be a fucking moron
[V],globeplus,2013-06-14T23:52Z,"Hi and thank you for addicionate to my general comment about the file the possible fact that can be movie time missing to this cam, as i said before i hope a better cam soon as possible ... happy movies to all of you ..."
,marcosrob,2013-06-15T01:55Z,"Not full movie!!!
Just 99 min."
,GpB311,2013-06-15T01:58Z,"Blurry, possibly missing some parts, and theres like 20 min where half the screen is blocked. 

Also, as stated above, its in Spanish."
,Mugglelover,2013-06-15T02:02Z,5 video and 9 audio (but if you don't into Spanish you're SOL). Not the entire movie; seems to be an hour short. Good for a free preview.
,pollitomichu,2013-06-15T02:06Z,"uncomplete movie, 1 HOUR MISSING, STOP SEEDING THIS CRAPP"
,iamlaze,2013-06-15T02:20Z,"@GlobePlus, Fuck the haters, do what you do! If it wasn't for trusted, great uploaders like you, thepiratebay would be total shit! You rock as usual... people should keep in mind, you are an uploader. They forget that sometimes. Keep it going!!!"
,Veganisman,2013-06-15T03:47Z,The Movie is not complete and there is a person blocking the screen. But thanks for who upload it's the only version we have until now! 
,Veganisman,2013-06-15T03:49Z,This one is the True Movie!
,DreamPhreak,2013-06-15T04:09Z,"Oh, Spanish DUB, I don't know why I kept reading that as Sub. Thanks anyways. (I saw the movie today in theatres, its a really great movie that provides a lot of backstory to kick off this man of steel series with, was just looking for this cam to recheck two parts i missed because of people using their phones every 5 minutes, people talking, and one guy's cellphone ringtone that sounded like a submarine/factory alarm going off)"
,Satafakap,2013-06-15T05:16Z,"Update:
V3 watchable, especially the slow motion parts. The fast motion parts are very pixelate. 
A7 but it's so fake when Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner habla espanol"
,scammyguy,2013-06-15T05:20Z,Complete waste of bandwidth
,Satafakap,2013-06-15T05:24Z,... pixelated.
,bonethugnharmony,2013-06-15T06:57Z,"@payaso13, Mexican is not a language. Spanish is a language. The movie is in Spanish not in Mexican. Dumb ass. "
,bonethugnharmony,2013-06-15T07:02Z,"@globeplus, thanks for the effort. I guess the asshole filming this ran out of battery. Obviously the idiot recording this fucking eternal movie ran out of juice.
"
,greenarrow0,2013-06-15T08:13Z,I want it in english and a better quality please someone :(
,pollitomichu,2013-06-15T08:51Z,"STOP SEEDING THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE, THIS MOVIE IS NOT COMPLETE!!!! ITS JUST 1:30 FROM 2:30"
,bonethugnharmony,2013-06-15T09:00Z,"I was so baked of this bomb Mexican weed that I felt like I was in the movie theater. That is some good fucking herb. Great Movie. Watch it high and it kills.


V=4
A=5

Watchable but missing ending......thanks still buddy !!!!!"
,boofnut01,2013-06-15T12:00Z,its legit tho blurry in Spanish and missing a bit! NOT as much as some of the comments say as it IS NOT a 2 hour 20min film but actually 1:48 so its missing almost 9 minutes NOT the whole HOUR as some would lead you to believ1 seed it as its an ok stop gap till the film hits your country!
,boofnut01,2013-06-15T12:04Z,pollitomichu YOU ARE WRONG its missing 9 minutes NOT an hour! the film is 1 hour 48 mins long not well over 2 hours so GET FUCKED YOU TROLL or get your facts right
,Veganisman,2013-06-15T12:48Z,boofnut01 You are wrong it's missing almost 1 hour because the full movie has 148 minutes not 1:48 hour! 148 minutes is = 2:28 hour! ... Remembering 60 minutes = 1 hour / 120 minutes = 2 hours / 148 minutes = 2:28 hours! Check for the info on google!
,boofnut01,2013-06-15T13:42Z,Veganisman seems you are right! cheers I in fact got MY facts wrong and pollitomichu I TOTALLY apologize but still till there's a decent FULL version this is a nice taste ;)
,tflagger997,2013-06-15T13:53Z,"boofnut01 - Wow, overreact much?  Perhaps *you* should have checked your facts, like page 1 of the comments?

So people, all versions of this *are* missing 1 hour, which is almost *half* the movie, not just the end (as our high friends think).  

I have to confess I did not read the duration was only 1h39m, so my previous comment about being a micro release (for iPhone sized display only) was assuming this was the whole movie.  Given the size of the file, and the expected 2h20m, that would have been a very small (or very choppy) encode to fit into 400MB."
,Fabian7,2013-06-15T14:46Z,"This is a decent teaser if you understand Spanish. Fast motion is of course grotesquely pixelated (because of the way compression algorithms work), and, as everyone's saying, it's missing a big chunk of the movie at the end. Plus, the camera lense is half covered for part of it, and for much of the video, the camera is off-center.

I'd recommend waiting half a day or so for something better."
,greenarrow0,2013-06-15T15:43Z,yeah i think its fake people we have to waite a couple of days for the better releases. 
,saint84,2013-06-15T16:56Z,"total crap. pixelated like crazy . move all the time the camera and you can't see half the movie for ever and a big chunk of the movie missing .
total shit and i don't care if it is free"
,boofnut01,2013-06-15T18:41Z,tflagger997 you should perhaps read the comment above yours!
,Ansset82,2013-06-15T23:14Z,"Guys....
This is spanish from South america.... called (LAT)
Other spanis y from Europe, Spain... Called (ES)
This superman are in LAT..."
,irshaadm20,2013-06-16T03:56Z,You guys who are saying the movie is missing 9mins are so stupid...the movie its 148Mins long (not 1hr and 48mins)which equals 2hrs and 28mins. Dont belive me? See for yourself http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Steel_(film). Geez you internet trolls feel you know everything
,Seedicle,2013-06-16T03:58Z,WHYYY!!! I dont speak spanish! :(
,boofnut01,2013-06-16T10:38Z,irshaadm20 you call me stupid but you comment about something without reading only a few comments down where the first comment was subtracted NOW THAT'S STUPID
,scammyguy,2013-06-17T04:02Z,"A: 1
