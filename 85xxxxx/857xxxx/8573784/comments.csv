[V],mirrormaster82,2013-06-14T17:33Z,"BTW,did you read this,is it interesting?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-14T17:48Z,"Nightwing1945, yeah i thought it looked good but no, probably not a good idea to turn ones guts inside out, lol.

for the comics you're seeking, i'm unfortunately exhausted and gotta go to the doctor in a couple of hours... but if you're willing, you might find most of them here:  http://bolt.cd/board/f234/new-comics-releases-2-a-833931/index18.html  i see classic popeye & critter on that page, just skimming over it!

you do have to register for their message board, but then all you have to do is click thanks on a post and follow links to 1 of the various download sites.

sorry i'm not helping out much, but maybe this will assist you in your quest."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-14T17:49Z,"LMAO crap mirrormaster82, i didn't search beforehand... thanks for it, and no i haven't read it yet. my brain is not functioning, i think i shall go back to sleep.  ;-)"
