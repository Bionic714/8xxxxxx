Francis CrickΓÇöthe quiet genius who led a revolution in biology by discovering, quite literally, the secret of lifeΓÇöwill be bracketed with Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein as one of the greatest scientists of all time. In his fascinating biography of the scientific pioneer who uncovered the genetic codeΓÇöthe digital cipher at the heart of heredity that distinguishes living from non-living thingsΓÇöacclaimed bestselling science writer Matt Ridley traces Crick's life from middle-class mediocrity in the English Midlands through a lackluster education and six years designing magnetic mines for the Royal Navy to his leap into biology at the age of thirty-one and its astonishing consequences. In the process, Ridley sheds a brilliant light on the man who forever changed our world and how we understand it.
