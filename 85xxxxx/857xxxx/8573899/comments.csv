Why I was suggesting label them 'podcast' is because others do (mark levin show) and that both of my mp3 players don't resume playback after shutting down unless they are labeled in genre as 'podcast' or 'audio book'."

,grider,2013-06-15T03:28Z,Yup.  That is why I used it as an example.  I just thought others might not really know about resume play on most players unless they are labeled correctly.
