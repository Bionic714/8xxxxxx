The name ΓÇö pronounced EEE-fah, by the way ΓÇö might not be immediately recognizable, but singer/songwriter Aoife OΓÇÖDonovan is no newcomer. She has already spent a decade fronting and releasing five studio albums with the progressive bluegrass band Crooked Still. In her spare time she contributed to the all-female acoustic act Sometymes Why. But she waited until her only choice for producer, Tucker Martine, could work with her to record this stunning solo debut.

Sharp-eyed roots music fans will recognize the opening track, ΓÇ£Lay My Burden Down,ΓÇ¥ from Alison KraussΓÇÖ 2011 cover. OΓÇÖDonovanΓÇÖs version adds a reverbed surf guitar that comes out of nowhere, bringing an edge never hinted at in KraussΓÇÖ more traditional version. As the album progresses, OΓÇÖDonovan slathers her hushed, sexy vocals over a potent combination of folk, pop and country influenced music that simmers with white heat. Her backup musicians bring tensile heft to melodies such as the sultry ΓÇ£Red & White & Blue & GoldΓÇ¥ (watch her perform a gorgeous solo version in the American Songwriter offices here) that seem familiar the first time you hear them. OΓÇÖDonovanΓÇÖs subtle phrasing on the shimmering ΓÇ£Glowing HeartΓÇ¥ is provided a boost when a mournful violin suddenly appears, pushing the tune into an edgy melancholy that will give you chills. A jazz undercurrent throbs under the surface of ΓÇ£IΓÇÖm AloneΓÇ¥ that, along with ominously thumping drums, conveys a slightly uncomfortable vibe.

ItΓÇÖs a terrific and enriching listen, especially with headphones, where the singerΓÇÖs supple voice and imaginative lyrics along with MartineΓÇÖs sympathetic production dovetail with an effortless grace. The 10 songs unfold in a nimble 40 minutes that show OΓÇÖDonovanΓÇÖs years of preparation for this long delayed solo project. ItΓÇÖs an auspicious beginning for what will hopefully be a fertile career where she is no longer cloaked under another bandΓÇÖs banner.
