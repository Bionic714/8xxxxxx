These are a few things that makes a '2-click run' version a better version.

If everybody seeds, you will get higher downloading speeds.

Description:
general compression algorithm is optimized for better
utilization of several processor cores. While some speed gain
is possible even in single processor mode, best results
are achieved in multi-core environment
**********************************************************************************
Speed gain depends on data type and average file size
Several cores are utilized more efficiently when compressing
large files
b) we had to increase memory requirements to achieve higher
compressionGeneral RAR compression algorithm allocates
about 120 MB comparing to 40 MB in WinRAR 4.11;
c) RAR text compression algorithm cannot utilize several CPU cores
efficiently, so its performance in multiprocessor environment
is much lower than for general algorithm. Also its decompression
speed is much lower than in general algorithm regardless of
CPU number. So we decided to disable the text algorithm by default
***********************************************************************************
If you need maximum possible compression ratio for plain text data
regardless of speed, you can enable the text compression
in "Advanced compression parameter" dialog. Press "Compression..."
button on "Advanced" page of archiving dialog to access it
You can also change this option permanently in default compression
profile;
*********************************************************************************
Fastest" (-m1) compression mode also supports several processor
cores now. In 4.11 it could use only a single processor core
RAR general decompression algorithm speed is slightly improved
though not to same extent as RAR compression. RAR decompression
is not able to use several processor cores, so its performance
does not depend on a number of cores
*********************************************************************************
Changes in ZIP compression:
**********************************************************************************
now ZIP compression supports several processor cores resulting
in noticeably higher performance in multi-core environment
Single CPU ZIP compression is also faster than in 4.11;
memory use for ZIP compression is increased to about 15 MB
