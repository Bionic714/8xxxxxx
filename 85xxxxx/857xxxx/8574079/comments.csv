,Extremist,2013-06-15T20:06Z,"@chrys: The files posted 05.June in torrents 'Hitlist week 2013.05.29 Part 1' to 'Part 3' had exactly the same files as posted 30.May in torrents 'Hitlist 2013.05.22 Part 1' to 'Part 5'.
Think these are the files that should've been posted 05.June.

Anyways, more comics for us! Thanks again sj!"
