"'Tubular Bells', an ambitious 50-minute composition, was an immediate hit in Britain. The album consists of short, uncompelling melodies - based on rock, classical and British folk themes - repeated over and over at sluggish tempos, with various instruments (mostly fretted or keyboard) playing the same part. It's simplistic, monotonous and far too long, but fragmented into a 45 and released as the theme song from the film 'The Exorcist', it also became a pop smash in America." **
"The follow-up 'Hergest Ridge', was similar, although it emphasized the folk derivation and offered more colorful and pastoral textures and phrases."
"'Ommadawn' capitalized on it's predecesor's improvements, and added livelier, more forceful playing, as well as more catchy phrases. Still, it lacks sufficient imagination to sustain the composition over an entire LP." **
- Dave Marsh, Rolling Stone

"A musician with the technique and formal imagination of Terry Riley or Philip Glass can create electronic keyboard meditations worthy of hokey adjectives like "mysterious" or "majestic." The best I can come up with here is "pleasant" and "catchy." Oldfield isn't Richard Strauss or even Leonard Cohen--this is a soundtrack because that's the level at which he operates."
