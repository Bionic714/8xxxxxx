,4SK1N,2013-06-14T22:35Z,This album is crap! The auto-tuning is gay. The third song features God. I don't think God would make a shitty album like this.

,spamzer,2013-06-15T19:33Z,"What edgy comments! Album is fine, just be sure to use a VPN or anonymizing service, Def Jam is bound to send RIAA after this album like flies on shit (puns might be intended)."
,arslanistic,2013-06-16T05:37Z,i dont like kanye as a person [i hate him actually] but i love some of his music... and a couple of tracks in this album are amazing. so even if you are a kanye hater do check it out [ also its free] and i am sure you'll find a song you like
,4SK1N,2013-06-16T08:46Z,God u didn't make the top 100 :(
,dzanaj23,2013-06-17T02:49Z,Cant stand hip hop today but J. Coles the only new cat I listen too. Born Sinner KILLS this Shit. Not even CLOSE!!!!! Lyrically Kanye cant even get on COLES level!!! Even though Coles from the South he got that ol school east coast flow.. Coles the Sickest Lyricist in da game!!!
