,lawrencew,2013-06-15T18:46Z,"Chris Hedges: The film ""peddles the state’s contention that WikiLeaks is not a legitimate publisher and that Bradley Manning, who allegedly passed half a million classified Pentagon and State Department documents to WikiLeaks, is not a legitimate whistle-blower. It interprets acts of conscience and heroism by Assange and Manning as misguided or criminal. It holds up the powerful—who are responsible for the plethora of war crimes Manning and Assange exposed—as, by comparison, trustworthy and reasonable. Manning is portrayed as a pitiful, naive and sexually confused young man. Assange ... is presented as a paranoid, vindictive megalomaniac and a sexual deviant...""

""Two of Gibney’s previous films, 'Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room' and 'Taxi to the Dark Side,' were masterful explorations into the black heart of empire. This time, Gibney was commissioned by Universal Studios—owned by Comcast—and paid to make a motion picture on WikiLeaks. He gave his corporate investors what they wanted."""

,village1diot,2013-06-16T17:42Z,"The first clue that this is a pile of rubbish is the title, ""We Steal Secrets"".

Quite obvious what they want you to think.

The only thing I don't get is why Julian would allow them to put his photograph on the cover?"

I assume you're talking about me, since I'm the only person who posted a link. The link I posted was to the annotated transcript of this film, released by Wikileaks, which makes it clear where the filmmaker's allegiances lie.

I am not a troll or spammer; rather, I simply cannot stand the thought of so many well-meaning pirates absorbing the disinformation contained in this documentary instead of the truth. Again, the link, which you may Google to confirm is accurate:

,uheardmebitch,2013-06-17T07:11Z,i can cofirm above link is legitimate
