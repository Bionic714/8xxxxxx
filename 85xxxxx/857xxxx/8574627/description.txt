  Like fellow dubstep producer Burial, Zomby was initially a walking enigma -- no information about his real name was known, nor were there photos of him with his face revealed. But where the former cultivated an anonymous profile common to so many electronic music knob-twiddlers, Zomby was, in a way, dubstep's own version of virtuoso guitarist Buckethead. His first official picture displayed him in ninja clothing, with a cardboard Eye of Providence covering his visage -- an image he joked about procuring from a Google Images search. Nevertheless, his old-school rave-inflected take on dubstep garnered a cult following in electronic music circles, which only increased with the release of his 2008 debut album, Where Were U in 92?. The jittery One Foot Ahead of the Other EP was released the following year. He then signed to 4AD, where he released 2011's melodically rich Dedication.
