Here's the early Hampton Fancher draft of BLADE RUNNER -- one of the greatest Sci-Fi screenplays ever written and one the coolest films every to grace the screen.

Brilliantly written, with a lot of different stuff than the studio release.  A real treat for Blade Runner fans and addicts like myself.
