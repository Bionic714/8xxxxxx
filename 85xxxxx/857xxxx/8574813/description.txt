Healing with herbs has long been a tradition in the martial arts. Most martial artists are aware of this legacy; few are fortunate to study with teachers who understand and can teach the traditional Chinese formulas. The rest of us pick up what we can, whereever we can. This book is for the rest of us. Western Herbs for Martial Artists and Contact Athletes explores herbs that are readily available in the West. Sixty-four herbs common to Europe and North America are considered. Each herb is examined for its effectiveness, safety, and how to specifically use it to enhance martial arts and contact sports training. Readers will be able to choose an herb to meet a specific need, understand how to purchase it, prepare it, and use it safely. This book will be an asset for your library, don't put it on the bottom shelf, because you will refer to it often
