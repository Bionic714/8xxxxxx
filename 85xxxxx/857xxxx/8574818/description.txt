To gaze at the stars is one thing; to capture that gaze in photographs is
something else, a tantalizing scientific art that many attempt and few
master. That rare mastery is on full display in this beautiful volume of
space photography from thirty of the most accomplished astrophotographers
in the world, both professional and amateur. Galaxies, star clusters
nebulae, and other deep-sky treasures fill the pages. Along with the
marvels of the night sky-the Andromeda and Whirlpool galaxies, the
Pleiades and the Praesepe, the Orion and Crab nebulae, and many more-each
section features a profile of the photographer's work, techniques
philosophy, and experiences. Compiled by the world's leading amateur
astrophotographer, with an introduction to the history of space
photography, this spectacular volume is an essential for every
stargazer's bookshelf
