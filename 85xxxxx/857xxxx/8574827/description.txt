
Manic Street Preachers - Forever Delayed (The Greatest Hits) [only1joe] MP3-320 kbps

Forever Delayed is a greatest hits album by the Manic Street Preachers, released in October 2002. The album included three singles which had never appeared on earlier albums ("Motown Junk," "Suicide Is Painless," and "The Masses Against the Classes"), the latter being one of the band's two UK #1 hits, along with "If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next." Several songs were edited for length ("Motorcycle Emptiness," "You Love Us", "Australia," "Everything Must Go," "Little Baby Nothing," and "The Everlasting") so that more tracks could fit onto the CD (though not listed as edits in the liner notes). The album entered the UK Album Chart at No.4.
