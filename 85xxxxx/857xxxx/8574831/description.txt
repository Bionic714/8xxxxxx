The New Yorker offers a signature mix of reporting and commentary on politics, international affairs, and the arts, along with fiction, poetry, humor, and cartoons.

This pdf is full-page full-content sccan (as opposed to my previous torrent where I wanted to upload as fast as possible, thus full-page advertisements and the town-specific "Goings On About Town" section were left out.)
