,dzanaj23,2013-06-17T02:49Z,Cant stand hip hop today but J. Coles the only new cat I listen too. Born Sinner KILLS this Shit. Not even CLOSE!!!!!  Lyrically Kanye cant even get on COLES level!!! Even though Coles from the South he got that ol school east coast flow.. Coles the Sickest Lyricist in da game!!!
