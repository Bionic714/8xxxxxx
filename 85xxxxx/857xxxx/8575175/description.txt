This is a set of PDF files of Blueprints & Floor Plans for the Waverly Hills Sanatorium located in Louisville, Kentucky.

- There are 17 DX Murphy plans from 1924
- There are 5 Luckett & Farly plans from 1962 when it was renovated

You won't find these any where else unless you go to the Louisville Metro Acrhives like I did. These are large, extremely well detailed prints.
