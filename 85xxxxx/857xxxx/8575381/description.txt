Notes:

Arguably one of the best movies ever, based on a true story about Henry Hill's experience with the mob and the subsequent fall-out. Unlike most other 1080p torrents of this movie, this one includes both commentary tracks - both the cast and crew commentary track as well as a commentary track with the real Henry Hill. The cast and crew commentary track is the 2nd audio track and the Henry Hill commentary is the third audio track.

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.
