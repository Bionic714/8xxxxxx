This is the first season of breaking bad converted to MP4 for the purposes of watching on my Vita. After spending an hour or more converting each one, it seemed someone else may appreciate me saving them the time should they opt to watch Breaking Bad on their Vita like I did.

The file size is small, but the show looks great on the Vita. How it may look on a larger screen someone else would have to tell you (if my computer ran well enough to run it,I would not have bothered converting it), but I would imagine it more than watchable.

Expect the rest of the seasons to follow.
