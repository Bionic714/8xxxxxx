With the rerelease of Leather's debut solo album Shock Waves everyone will realize why Leather is considered the preeminent female heavy metal vocalist of the 80s.

She received rave reviews from magazines worldwide and is still mentioned as one of the most powerful voices in female metaldom. 

Originally released in 1989, Shock Waves features some of the biggest names in heavy metal today: John Luc He'bert-Drums (King Diamond, Mercyful Fate, Chastain), Michael Harris-Guitars (Zanister, Arch Rival, solo projects, Surgeon), and David Harbour-Bass (King Diamond, Chastain).
