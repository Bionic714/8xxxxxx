Two novels by Austrian author Hermann Broch (1886-1951):

Hermann Broch - The Death of Virgil, translated from the German by Jean Starr Untermeyer (Vintage, 1995) [reissue].

ISBN: 9780679755487 | 496 pages | EPUB

The Death of Virgil [Der Tod des Vergil] was originally published in 1945. Begun while the author was imprisoned in a German concentration camp, this extraordinary and profound novel is widely regarded as one of the great works of 20th-century modernism; its stream of consciousness and complex literary allusions were influenced by the style of James Joyce.

The narrative depicts the last hours of life of the Roman poet Virgil, author of the Aeneid, in the port of Brundisium, where he accompanies the Roman emperor Augustus; his decision -- frustrated by Augustus -- to burn his Aeneid; and his final reconciliation with his destiny. Virgil's heightened perceptions as he dies recall his life and the age in which he lives, and the squalor and splendor of imperial Rome. The poet is in the interval between life and death, just as his culture hangs between the pagan and Christian eras.

Part historical novel and part prose poem, The Death of Virgil is an intensely musical and immensely evocative meditation on the relation between life and death, the ancient and the modern.
