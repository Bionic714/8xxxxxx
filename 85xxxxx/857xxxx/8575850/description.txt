Dick Dale ΓÇÄΓÇô Calling Up Spirits

Calling Up Spirits album for sale by Dick Dale was released May 21, 1996 on the Beggars Banquet label. The second album released after Dick Dale's post-PULP FICTION career rehabilitation, 1996's CALLING UP SPIRITS takes up where 1994's UNKNOWN TERRITORY had left off, blending elements of world music and R&B into the surf-guitar style that Dale almost single-handedly invented. As the title and cover art suggest, there's a level of spirituality in this music that you don't normally associate with instrumental surf. Calling Up Spirits CD music contains a single disc with 13 songs. 
Recorded and mixed at Prarie Sun Recording, Cotati, CA, January 1996. Mastered at OceanView Digital Mastering, Los Angeles, CA.
