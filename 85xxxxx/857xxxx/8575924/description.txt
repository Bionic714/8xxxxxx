The subtitle of Black Aria II is Lilith, Whore of the Desert, a reference to Lilith, the first wife of Adam and the subject of the album's content. Danzig explained ΓÇ£This one is more Eastern, because it's about Lilith. It still has a lot of the classic elements I like, but many of the sounds come from elsewhere because of this fascinating story, which has its origins in even older myths and legends.ΓÇ¥
Black Aria II is produced, written and - with a couple of exceptions - performed by Danzig. Tommy Victor provides some additional guitar, and Tania Themmen performs female vocals. The music employs various sounds, including organ, strings, percussion, chimes, chants and lamentations. Some of the pieces comprise of up to 40 individual music tracks. "Unclean Sephira" consists entirely of layered vocal tracks.
Discussing the writing and recording process, Danzig stated ΓÇ£I just let the story take me. Each song tells me what it wants. Sometimes I have it all written in my head - every single part. But at other times, I'll be doing the skeleton framework and different parts will come to me. At times, I'll be listening to playback and suddenly I'll hear where another part can go. It tells me what I need to add'
