[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-15T08:33Z,"well done! thanks for these.

just by chance, do you have any of the NotLD comics, published by Fantaco around 1991? i used to have one called NotLD: london that was very amusing. but i've never read the last issue!"

I don't have any of the NotLD from the 90's but someone did upload the London series recently:
