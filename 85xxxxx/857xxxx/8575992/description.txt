Description:

Set in the excess of the late 1970s we follow the world as it has evolved with the zombie threat, a disaster they thought they had under control. When the city is locked down with quarantine, a group of survivors finds out the hard way that even with the undead, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And in this case it means a female punk rock zombie fetishist has to grow up in a hurry when her hedonistic boyfriend is bitten by a real ghoul. No more fun and games - it's time for a horror tale that rips you out of the safe zone with a fast paced violent survival story.
