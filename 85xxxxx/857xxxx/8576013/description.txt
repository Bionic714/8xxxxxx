group notesΓÇª: Dear nuke-net participants, 

we ask you honestly to stop nuking for 
an invalid reason, above all if you do not even know any member of our group to 
prove if itΓÇÖs valid or not. May you feel confused if a grp does not release that 
much most others do. Especially if itΓÇÖs has serveed a couple of sections like we 
did in the past. But now we want to satisfy our needs by figuring the folliwing 
out clearly We did not steal this group name. Sure we did not do much since 2005, 
but we are going to kick start our group again. So thats is not a valid reason to 
ban us from releasing

Thanks a lot for appreciation

Team DEFA

We prohibit any possible 0day releases which could be made by using this one

And weΓÇÖre also saying thanks to a good new friend who made this happen

So finally.. just enjoy it
