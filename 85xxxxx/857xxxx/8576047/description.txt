David is an uninspired artist living in an old European castle. He becomes infaturated with a beautiful image he sees only in his mind. Later he realizes that this ghostly apparition is really the former mistress of the castle almost two centuries ago. Anita Rinaldi- Europe's most daring director- takes you back in time- and backdoor in every scene surrounded by European splendor.
