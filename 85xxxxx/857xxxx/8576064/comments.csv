""Stripping the pretensions of those who claim a spot among the culturally elite, it is the story of Mrs. Aldwinkle and her entourage, who are gathered in an Italian palace to relive the glories of the Renaissance. For all their supposed sophistication, they are nothing but sad and superficial individuals in the final analysis."""

I think I might have come across Those Barren Leaves at a local used bookshop last week. Maybe I'll go back and take a look. Thanks for the suggestion."
