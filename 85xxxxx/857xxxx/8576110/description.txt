Taft Jordan - 1961 - Mood Indigo (1999)

Taft Jordan is someone who should have done a lot more recording as a leader, but regrettably, the swing trumpeter recorded only a handful of albums. One of them was 1961's Mood Indigo, a tribute to Duke Ellington (Jordan's employer from 1943 to1947). With sidemen including guitarist Kenny Burrell, pianist Richard Wyands, bassist Joe Benjamin, and drummer Charlie Persip, the album underscored the fact that Jordan was an expressive, highly accessible soloist who was as swinging as he was melodic. In fact, his lyricism on familiar Ellington pieces like "Sophisticated Lady," "Mood Indigo," "I Didn't Know About You," and "In a Sentimental Mood" is simply gorgeous. [A 1999 Fantasy reissue added six 1960 recordings from the Swingsville All-Stars, a sextet that united Jordan with tenor saxman Al Sears (another Ellington associate), alto saxman Hilton Jefferson, pianist Don Abney, bassist Wendall Marshall, and drummer Gus Johnson.] (AllMusic)
