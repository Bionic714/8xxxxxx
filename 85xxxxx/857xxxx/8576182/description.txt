Kona, Monarch of Monster Isle is a fictional American comic book character who was featured in his own self titled series, published by Dell Comics in the 1960s.
The character was created during a period of transition for Dell Comics. Up until 1962 Dell had been the official comic book publisher for Western Publishing, the licencer for Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. among others. This relationship ended when Western made the decision to start its own comic book publishing company, Gold Key Comics.
Faced with the prospect of losing the rights to all of the series they were publishing, Dell began a large scale campaign in which numerous series and characters were created. This was designed to allow Dell to survive as a company past the point of Gold Key's creation. Of the characters created during this period, Kona was one of Dell's most successful creations.
