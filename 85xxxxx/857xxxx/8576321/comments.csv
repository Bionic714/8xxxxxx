I've got as far as 70% on Home.And.Away.Weekly.2013.04.29 and it's stopped again - no seeders. Could you seed it again, please? The problem is that when it is being seeded, the download speed is only between 1 and 5 kbps, so it's very slow. 

My bit-torrent client is telling me that there are 13 other peers trying to download this torrent, who must all be stuck on 70%, so it's not just me that you would be helping by seeding (until the availability shows as 2.00). 

I will continue to seed after I've fully downloaded.

Thanks for sharing - Teknulpe."
