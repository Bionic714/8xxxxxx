Thriller with sarcastic dark humour directed by Stig Svendsen. 
It follows the struggles and conflicts of nine strangers trapped in a Wall Street elevator 49 floors above Manhattan on the way to a company party. One of the group has a bomb. The film's events follow the group's attempts to escape (with racism, greed and revenge including some bloodbath lol) playing key elements as they all fight to survive.

Bad ratings at imdb are ridiculous. All actors including the little girl perform perfectly well. Sarcastic humor is a mark of higher intelligence so no wonder that majority of folks just didn't get it. Those unsatisfied relying on poorly translated subtitles shouldn't blame the movie but the translators.
Not a second I (and some friends) got bored during the whole movie. Get high before watching lol, it might help. If you're into a "too serious mood" postpone it for "better" times.
