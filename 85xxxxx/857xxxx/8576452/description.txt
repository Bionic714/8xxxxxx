Realizing emptiness or grasping the true nature of reality lies at the heart of the Buddhist path. In this book, Gen Lamrimpa offers practical instruction on Madhyamaka, insight meditation aimed at realizing emptiness. Drawing on his theoretical training as well as his extensive meditative experience, he explains how to use Madhyamaka reasoning to experience the way in which all things exist as dependently related events.

"Written by a genuine Buddhist master, How to Realize Emptiness gives accurate directions to explore the nature of reality and come to the correct view of the Middle Way."
--Ven. Thubten Chodron, author of Buddhism for Beginners

"Not quite emptiness made easy--an impossibility--but it is at least emptiness made comprehensible."
--Dharma Life

"An important commentary clarifying the Madhyamika view and synthesizing venerated scriptural references, enhancing understanding of the view of emptiness. Ven. Gen Lamrimpa's elucidation reflects his remarkable practice and life."
--Tenzin Kacho, resident teacher of Thubten Shedrup Ling and Buddhist Chaplain with the United States Air Force Academy

"The teachings are profound and clearly guide one toward realizing the nature of emptiness.... Each chapter is a gem detailing in clear language the apparent nature of ignorance and its dependence on the individual for its existence."
--Inner Directions

"Gen Lamrimpa has a down-to-earth approach to this difficult subject which is immediately accessible to beginning students, further clarified by B. Alan Wallace's translation.... Gen Lamrimpa's teachings, which combine analysis with practical exercises, are redolent with compassion and insight."
--Mandala Magazine
