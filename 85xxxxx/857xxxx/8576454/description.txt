Rumble Racing combines a few different arcade racing mechanics to deliver an experience where every second counts.

The driving experience is very arcade, with the emphasis on fun rather than realistic. Traction, vehicle stability and acceleration are all akin to movie car chases than real world.

PCSX2 v 1.0 + bios & plugins included. My setup snapshots are included for those who have not used the emulator before (Very easy to use)

I recommend a reasonable rig with a Core 2 duo 2.4GHz cpu or better.

AMD Radeon HD 5 series or better, or, GeForce GT 610 or better.
