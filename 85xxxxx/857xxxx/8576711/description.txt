Book Description

ΓÇ£Joyland is a breathtaking, beautiful, heartbreaking book....Even the most hardboiled readers will find themselves movedΓÇ¥ (Charles Ardai, Edgar- and Shamus Award-winning editor of Hard Case Crime).

Set in a small-town North Carolina amusement park in 1973, Joyland tells the story of the summer in which college student Devin Jones comes to work as a carny and confronts the legacy of a vicious murder, the fate of a dying child, and the ways both will change his life forever. Joyland is a brand-new novel and has never previously been published.

Amazon.com Review
An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2013: What a smart, sweet, spooky, sexy gem of a story. In this one-off for the Hard Case Crime publishing imprint, King has found yet another outlet and format (print only, a280 pages) to suit his considerable talents. All are on full display here in the story of Devon Jones--"a twenty-one-year-old virgin with literary aspirations ΓÇª and a broken heart"--who spends the summer of 1973 at Joyland amusement park in North Carolina. Devon makes new pals, proves himself to the hard-core carny workers, saves a girlΓÇÖs life, befriends a dying boy (who has a secret gift), and falls for the boyΓÇÖs protective, beautiful mother. The first half of the story is sweet and nostalgic, with modest hints of menace to come. (Think: ΓÇ£The Body,ΓÇ¥ KingΓÇÖs novella that became the film Stand By Me.) Devon learns to ΓÇ£sell funΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£wear the furΓÇ¥ (carny-speak for dressing as Howie the Happy Hound, the park mascot), but he also learns about the woman who had been killed in the Funhouse, whose ghost still haunts Joyland. King has fun with the carny lingo--most of it researched and real, some of it invented. (The Ferris wheel, for example, is the chump-hoister.) The second half gets spookier, spinning into a full-on murder mystery--but also a love story, and a coming-of-age-story, with some supernatural fun woven in. More than a trifecta, this is King at his narrative and nostalgic best. A single-session tale to savor some summer afternoon. And then try not to keep thinking back on it. --Neal Thompson --This text refers to the Paperback edition.

For the most part there are no chapter markers on the discs, and thus the tracklist below don't list chapters either.
