,tacosnack,2013-06-15T16:28Z,"It's kind of hard to justify seeding when this is exactly the same as your last torrent. It gets to 85% and stalls out. Looks like you've taken the standard edition and stuck some nonexistent filler tracks on there to make it look like the deluxe edition.

The drop in sound quality in ""Alone"" and ""Fashionably Late"" is exactly the same as the standard YouTube rip. This is a fake torrent."
