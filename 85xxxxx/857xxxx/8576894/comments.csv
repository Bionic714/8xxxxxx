,TheCrowdGoesWild,2013-06-15T12:31Z,Missing about an hour.... why even bother?

,tflagger997,2013-06-15T13:57Z,"Because the groups somehow make money doing this.  That is why they auto-post everything they can find, regardless of the quality.  Half their posts are of equal or lesser quality, than previous ones.  This is true for almost all the groups (and even some individuals) that post cam movies.

I totally agree, this is a waste of time missing nearly 1h19m which is close to half the movie, and is a poor encode for a total action movie (probably more the LQ source's fault though)."
,greenarrow0,2013-06-15T15:44Z, people we have to waite a couple of days for the better releases
,saint84,2013-06-15T16:58Z,"total crap. pixelated like crazy . move all the time the camera and you can't see half the movie for ever and a big chunk of the movie missing .

,Shoobox,2013-06-15T18:20Z,"@paperboy666
obviously you can't do math
the movie is 2hrs and 28 minutes

this is an hour and 39 minutes 

how do you get only missing ten minutes?"

,scammyguy,2013-06-17T04:01Z,Pixelated garbage and missing nearly a hour of the movie.
