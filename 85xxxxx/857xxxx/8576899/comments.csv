,marcosrob,2013-06-15T13:42Z,Full movie????
,tflagger997,2013-06-15T14:16Z,"No.  It is exactly what it appears to be.  A third copy of the same thing that Globeplus uploaded over 12 hours ago.  

The file size is exactly the same, and the credit (everything after the year - so ""AviCAM SpanishDub"") is also exactly the same.

Since that one is missing an hour of the movie, this one is as well.

Since most of this movie is action (and the rest is not worth paying attention to), then this might be one you actually want to see at the theater (on the cheap day).  A cam will have to be pretty impressive (as in HD) to not tear like crazy during the action sequences."
,greenarrow0,2013-06-15T15:45Z,people we have to waite a couple of days for the better releases
,TWEETY2455,2013-06-15T16:40Z,Sorry Drarbg i am a fan but this rip ? Nah -5V -6A
,saint84,2013-06-15T16:59Z,"total crap. pixelated like crazy . move all the time the camera and you can't see half the movie for ever and a big chunk of the movie missing .
total shit and i don't care if it is free"
,VOODOO1000,2013-06-15T17:32Z,Why do these A-holes keep uploading the same fucking thing over and over...>>>>>
,bonethugnharmony,2013-06-15T17:48Z,"Why this asshole drarbg takes a torrent that was already uploaded by SceneTime first as he does all his torrents to try to make them look like they are his, is a fucking mystery. He should call himself DirtBag.

Same fucking torrent from SceneTime
A=4
V=3

Pixelated to shit, camera moves. It´s a cell phone recording and the idiot recording it ran out of memory or batteries on his phone. This fucking movie runs over two hours.  I watched it and it is watchable if you are a fan. The end however is missing. Movie runs less than the real movie. It´s shy about an hour and cuts off at the scene with him and his mom (Diane Lane)."
,bitemi,2013-06-15T19:41Z,wtf Drarbg!
,napaka79,2013-06-15T22:48Z,They'll give skulls to anyone nowadays.....
,PirateHD,2013-06-16T00:30Z,"PROPS TO globeplus!!
@Drarbg. Pathetic to repost someone elses shitty cam. Get a life loser!"
,chrisnangels,2013-06-16T01:36Z,"Get off his back, so what if he copied another torrent, it gives us a choice..So stop whining like a bunch of little girls and get over it..Thank you Drarbg, I follow your downloads because I don't get virus's and that's all that matters to me.."
[V],simon200,2013-06-16T01:49Z,"Eh hello Fools
Most of the loaders here are members of fee paying sites and they ALL load the same copies, some sooner than others, none of them own the torrent they just share them so get off Drarbys back and upload something yourself, then and just then will you be entitled to an opinion
Cheers for the effort dude "
,Spongehammer,2013-06-16T03:42Z,"Spanish subs? It's just a Mexican dude doing the voices over top every character in the movie! And he's doing it in the theatre! Sometimes he just says, ""and so Superman is trying to save the world, ya know."""
,1EdgyGuy,2013-06-16T04:45Z,"Thank You for your effort I am a fan of yours but this is not a good copy I will wait until you have a better copy in a few days ,Thanks Again Drarbg"
,sith_neo,2013-06-16T11:02Z,"thanks Drarbg, all seeds
great job =) brothers"
,maniak79,2013-06-16T13:55Z,wats up wid all the bloody fake uploads..........
,some-young-guy,2013-06-16T17:27Z,"@ Simon200

Do loaders not pay attention to what they share?  Pay or not, every human being with fingers, ears and eyes should possess the ability to prescreen that which they are about to upload to determine if the file is intact or missing 66% of the purported materials.  Unfortunately this is not the case, loaders just blindly share everything as if some sort of bragging right is given for volume of files seeded irregardless of the quality.  So i gotta ask ya, do you pink, blue and green skulls get paid to upload?  Like do you get a higher bonus for sheer volume of incomprehensible materials? If yes, keep overloading TPB's server with completely irrelevant materials. "
,pollitomichu,2013-06-16T21:37Z,guys stop seeding!!!!! this movie is just 1:20 from 2:30. STOP SEEDING THIS CRAP
,scammyguy,2013-06-17T04:00Z,"Blurry pixelated hideous waste of bandwidth.

Also.... a large part of the movie is missing."
,greenarrow0,2013-06-17T07:01Z,getting anxious waiting for this movie in ENGLISH!! come on there are over 8 billion people on this planet and NOBODY has recorded man of steel in english for us pirates:) DAMNIT!!!! lol
,saint84,2013-06-17T12:50Z,"simon200 .  
anybody is entitled to his opinion , wether you like it or not . that is not dictatorship . so put up with it . i agree get off the uploader back . however , you can say it is shit when it is . if not then do not call this site pirate . you did not make the movie or paid for it to put it here 
would be nice if the uploader check their upload one a while "
