Thoola - A Bed of Fallen Autumn Leaves
======================================

Released January 17th, 2013


The new EP Bed of Fallen Autumn Leaves presents the band's work in a completely new light. As opposed to its predecessor, it was carefully crafted and arranged over the long period of time and with the usage of instrumentation unheard at live shows. It features pulsating acoustic rock songs where the driving rhythms and the acoustic guitar/cello interplays occasionally give way to stabs of electric guitar that together with urgent vocals render the whole record a rare listening experience.
