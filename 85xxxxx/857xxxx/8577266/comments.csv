[V],HeroMaster,2013-06-15T14:35Z,Its a Demo version got some Extended Maps and Exclusives so hear you go get the taste of SpinTires level up 2011 :)
,miked2138,2013-06-16T05:07Z," i wouldt waste the time with this demo, the other demo that is like 258mb is 100 times better it has the 4wd, mud and all, this demo is,, ""pick up package..install platform,,, you dont have platform installed, install platform again, you dont have platform installed ,,,repeat ad naudseum. total waste of time"
,miked2138,2013-06-16T05:22Z, it must be someone who wants to see this game fail that leaked  this version because it is so broken or glithced you cant even do the very first task.
,miked2138,2013-06-16T05:32Z,"the screenshots are from the other demo too, i honestly think whoever leaked this demo was trying to kill this games reputation and make it look like crap, , i deleted this after about 5 mins, its so glitched you can do the very first task"
,boragwak,2013-06-17T11:18Z,this is a crap demo....
