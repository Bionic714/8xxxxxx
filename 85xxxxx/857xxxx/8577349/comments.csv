No noob will destroy something they love anyway DoS attacks only really work in grate numbers all targeting one site. ""hopefully for a good reason like Anonymous hacktivists"""

,chop007,2013-06-16T21:57Z,"I wonder how many pc's in unison it would take to bring down nsa's servers.............They might just press that button through complete fear. Oh, what an age of gestapo we live in."

Just be careful what you do, you could get yourself in a lot of trouble with targeting sites like those."

,AaronxxArson,2013-06-17T04:59Z,"This torrent is probably going to get multiple people arrested. The reason these programs aren't available to the public is because they don't know how to use them properly.
Uploading a torrent full of DDOS tools with no instructions about security or VPN's is a really bad idea. 
Not to mention most of these tools are out-dated and LOIC leads right back to your IP, even over VPN or TOR."
