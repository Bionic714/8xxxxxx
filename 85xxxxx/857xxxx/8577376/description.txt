History Documentary hosted by Ian Mortimer, published by BBC in 2013 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Ian Mortimer transports viewers back to Elizabethan England and reveals, in vivid detail, a living, breathing Tudor world. Viewers learn how ordinary Tudor housewives turned plants into medicine, how the middle classes kept themselves clean using linen cloths, how the poor made pottage, how cooks of the rich devised recipes for new ingredients, and how Tudors learned to read and write.


1)  The Common People 
This episode he reveals the life of the common people of the Elizabethan age. Whilst most people have images of courtiers, lavish palaces and fine clothes, the reality is that most of the country is extremely poor. Ian also looks at the religious controversies threatening to pull the county apart, as well as the astoundingly cruel attitudes that were common at the time.

2)  The Rich 
This episode he introduces the world of the Elizabethan rich and privileged. Money alone is not enough to blend in with the Royal Court. A complex code of dress, greetings, behaviour and much more exists and even something as simple as an out of date outfit may result in exile from high society. It is literally a cut-throat world, where spies circle the great and good and one false word could cost everything. The wealthy also had one problem all of their own; the Queen herself - and bearing the cost of a Royal progress.

3)  Brave New World 
Dr Ian Mortimer travels through the world of a new and upwardly mobile section of Elizabethan society - the middle class. In a groundbreaking new way of exploring history, Ian takes viewers on a present-tense journey through this golden age of English history. Along the way he visits Stratford-Upon-Avon and reveals how urbanisation improves ordinary people's lives. He drops in at Shakespeare's school to uncover how education transforms society and explores how this age of discovery helps spur a scientific revolution that creates a new world. Ian also transports viewers to the electrifying world of Elizabethan theatre at Shakespeare's Globe and tells the dramatic story of how English imperial ambitions leads to the Armada and the threat of Spanish invasion.
