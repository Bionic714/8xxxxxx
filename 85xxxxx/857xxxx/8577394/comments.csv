1) Сomplete the download, unzip ""BibliotecaPleyades.zip"" archive and go
to the inside of ""BibliotecaPleyades ---> www.bibliotecapleyades.net"" folder.

Then, right click and open ""default.htm"" file (main page) with a browser, such as
Chrome or SRWare Iron (version of Chrome which is spyware-free and without Flash)

Now, you could use this offline copy just like the full-scale website :-)
Easily navigate between the different pages of website with a simple click.

2) After you completed step 1, at the address bar of browser there should be something like:
file://localhost/YourPathToFolder/BibliotecaPleyades/www.bibliotecapleyades.net/default.htm

When you need to get quickly to remote area, delete everything after the name of website:
file://localhost/YourPathToFolder/BibliotecaPleyades/www.bibliotecapleyades.net/

Your browser would show a full catalogue of website. Could be useful for easy navigation.

3) If the reference is not working, open file://localhost/YourPathToFolder/BibliotecaPleyades
and look through the website which was linked by this reference.
