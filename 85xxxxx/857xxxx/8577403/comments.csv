---------------------------------

Score: 97 (out of 100)


The following properties decreased the score:
•This rip was not done using test and copy, -10 points [10]
•This log was not perfect. However, all tracks were verified by AccurateRip with an average confidence of at least 2, meaning that the tracks were ripped properly. Because it was not ripped with test and copy and/or C2 pointers were used we can only boost the score from 90 to 97."
