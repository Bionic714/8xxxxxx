[ScoreLand] Sha Rizel (Calling Nurse Rizel / 06.14.2013)

Nurse Sha Rizel enters, looking like an angel of mercy in her tight uniform. Nurses don't dress like this anymore. Political correctness, work efficiency and all that, you know. No one wants to give the patients any more shocks. That can wait until they get their bills in the mail.

But in our hooter hospital, they do still dress the old-fashioned way. And the old ways are still the breast.

"Let me listen to your heart," says Nurse Rizel. She puts on her stethoscope and listens to your tom-tom already beating a fast tune at the sight of her. "You need to relax."

Relax? Impossible.

Nurse Rizel has the right prescription. Just sit back and enjoy the treatment. It looks like you're going to get kicked out of your bed so Sha can spread out.

As she will say later, "Now you will feel better."
