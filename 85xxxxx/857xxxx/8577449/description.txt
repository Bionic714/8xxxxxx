Shipping Wars: Season 1 
Each episode of "Shipping Wars" dives into the cutthroat world of heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport the unshippable. The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.


1)  Steel Horse 
The transporters compete for some unique shipments going cross-country as a 4,000 lbs., 22-foot steel horse and an oversized 7-foot-long Venus Flytrap come up for bid. Roy Garber and Jarrett Joyce are the big winners of the transports, respectively, but there's no time to celebrate when they both realize they may have bitten off more than they can chew....
