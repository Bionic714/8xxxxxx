The ArtistΓÇÖs Way for the Matrix Generation: the first- ever book-and-podcast joint production, all about maximizing creative potential

The biggest problem we face in life is that we don't get what we want, and what we don't want we get plenty of. We think we know what kind of partner, job, friends, home and life we want, but rarely does anything manifest the way we expect it to. We keep waiting for that big insight that will show us how to change our lives, but we can't seem to coax it out of the dark.
