Disclosure's debut is not only 2013's best dance record so far, it's also one of the most assured and confident debuts from any genre in recent memory. Dance music's long had a fickle relationship with the album format, but Settle's impeccable sequencing leads to a record that begs to be heard in its entirety. Some of Settle's giddiest highlights are clear 2-step/UK garage callbacks-- "Voices" and "You & Me", especially-- but Disclosure refuse to stick to any single genre. They effortlessly spin through romantic house ("Defeated No More", "F For You"), pitch-screwed bass music ("Second Chance"), and raunchy grime-inflected motifs ("Confess to Me"); nothing is off limits, and Settle is all the better for it.
