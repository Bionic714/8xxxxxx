Best selling author and integrative-medicine pioneer Andrew Weil, M.D., is one of the world's leading and most respected authorities on healthy and conscious living based on a progressive approach to health care encompassing body, mind, and spirit. Beginning with a meditation from Dr. Weil, this disc presents an hour of symphonic sounds guided by the principles of "psychoacoustics," a scientific field exploring the effects of sound on consciousness.
