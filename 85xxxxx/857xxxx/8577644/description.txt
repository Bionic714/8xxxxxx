A minor penalty that is not called until the offending team gains control of the puck. As long as the non-offending team maintains possession, the referee allows play to continue and signals a delayed penalty by raising his arm.

IΓÇÖm Evan Mason, an NHL hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks. I spend my nights roughing up two hundred pound defensemen and, at times, spend more time in the penalty box than I do on the ice.

ThatΓÇÖs my job. 

One night changed everything I thought I once knew about my life on, and off, the ice.

A girl. 

A brutally beaten girl left to die in an alley.
I donΓÇÖt know why or how but something made me stay that night after taking her to the hospital. I didnΓÇÖt know her, nor did I have an obligation to stay but something inside of me rooted me there telling me I should stay. Saving a life is worth something. At least I thought so. And I wouldnΓÇÖt have been me if I just simply left her there. 

Any man who put his heart and soul into a game of hockey couldnΓÇÖt just walk away when someone needed them. She had no one else right now. The same guy who saw determination where there was desire, now saw hope where there was once despair.

I couldnΓÇÖt leave. That wouldnΓÇÖt be me. No, not a man that put all he had into something some called just a game. I couldnΓÇÖt walk away from her holding onto life, weak and powerless to something she had no control over.

So I stayed. In a room full of family members praying for their loved ones to pull through, I prayed for a girl I didnΓÇÖt know and had never met before, to have a beating heart. While othersΓÇÖ sorrows turned to grieving pain, I sat waiting on the words of the unknown.

No bond is stronger than the ones youΓÇÖll bleed for.


Seed and Enjoy!
