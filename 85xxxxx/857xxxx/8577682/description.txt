Sharrie Williams - 2007 - I'm Here To Stay

Born in Saginaw Michigan on Jan 3rd, 1965, raised and influenced by a family of Gospel Singers and Blues Lovers, Sharrie began singing at the age of 12 with The Greater Williams Temple Church Choir of Saginaw. Sharrie became instantly captivated by powerful vocalists that had a dynamic stage presence - Billie Holiday, Tina Turner, Ruth Brown, Etta James and Koko Taylor.
Sharrie began to perform frequently throughout the 1990's with her band and instantly knew that this was what she wanted to do with her life enabling her to perfect her stage act and bringing her to wider audiences in the midwestern United States.
Since 2001, Sharrie has become well known overseas, where she has performed in over 15 countries and has entertained at the very best clubs and prestigious festivals largely in support of her Hard Drivin' Woman CD. Festival Promoters in The United States began to take notice of what Europe had known for quite a while and Sharrie performed at Chicago [2004], Pocono [twice - 2003 & 2005], Mississippi Valley [2005] & North Atlantic [2005] among many other USA & Canadian Performances.
Sharrie has a charismatic and radiant stage presence that takes hold of you and captures your heart and soul, with every note she can make you cry, laugh or dance and the best part is... She's as genuine off the stage as she is on... Sharrie is poised for the next level of stardom and proudly on the Electro-Fi label you are holding in your hands her first North American Record... The Wait Is Over...
I'm Here To Stay isn't just the name of Sharrie's CD; it is a woman's story of a tough, rough, gritty life and the determination to survive and thrive. Sharrie's on a mission - literally. She is compared frequently to many past and current blueswomen. While she is proud of that, her top notch live shows and her gifted songwriting skills position her at the forefront of todays contemporary scene. I'm Here To Stay features 15 songs [all written by Sharrie] and 1 hour of material that is very eclectic from beautiful ballads [Seeking, Will You Still Love Me, It's Getting Late] to Traditional Blues [Jealousy] to several get on the dance floor tunes [I'm Here To Stay, Fire, Power] to the New Orleans Flavored [I Gotta Find Me A Mojo] to The Gospel Drenched Finale [Pocono Praise].
