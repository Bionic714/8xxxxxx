Fly Me Courageous is the fourth studio album by the Hard Rock/Southern Rock band Drivin' N' Cryin', released on January 8, 1991 by Island Records.[1] The album is the band's most commercially successful release, in part due to the title track striking a patriotic chord with the United States during the start of the Persian Gulf War.[2] In 1995, Fly Me Courageous was certified gold. Ripped at 320 from the original CD.
