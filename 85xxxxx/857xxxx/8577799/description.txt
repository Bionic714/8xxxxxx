Back once again with more heavyweight jams, it's the man with the
dodgy name; yes it's Fingerman time again! This time we get the
laconic slouch funk of ""Tootin" which comes complete with possibly
the most chilled out rap of all time! Elsewhere, "Your Love" is
head-nodding 70s wah-wah guitar laden soul and "Phoenix" ends things
on disco diva high.
enjoy!
remember to support artists.

music that makes you groove no matter where you are.. and you
think you can add to this feeling.. then drop us a line d_h@zmail.com
