,mi.tom,2013-06-15T19:31Z,Excellent movie....thanx very much judas...i am a big fan of your work..keep them coming...can we do 3pass encoding too? i didn't know that.
,mi.tom,2013-06-15T19:34Z,Ant word on terminator series?are u still waiting for the special edition?
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-15T19:38Z,"you can do as many passes as you like.... 3 is about the bitter edge of doing the best job before it's entirely a waste of time..

most encoders will claim that 2 pass is a waste... but in some rare cases it isn't... I do 3 pass for EVERYTHING I've done so far, just because I have the time, AND in the situation where it may have an advantage... I've got it."

,Ancient_Alchemist,2013-06-16T01:08Z,"Why is it when I switch from stereo to 5.1, the background music and sound goes low (almost to the point of not being there for me due to hearing loss) but the voices get a nice big boost like I'm in a theater? I have headphones, but they can play up to 7.1. The boost in voices is nice but I don't understand why the background noise and music get so low (for all movies, didn't get this one. Just commenting here since it's the latest up). Not sure if you know about that kind of stuff, but figured I'd asked. Is it simply because I have headphones and need a true set up, or is this something standard?"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-16T08:00Z,"Depends on the headphones and the audio solution implemented on some laptops/desktops and even what external DAC with their own amps are designed to do.

I've personally handled a few stereo and 5.1 as well as 7.1 headphones. Frankly I've been a bit annoyed with many of them as some blurays that output in 5.1 or 7.1 would play kinda.... ""odd"". It was like the proper channels weren't getting the correct volumes.

The thing about my 5.1 encode is that the volumes and channel levels are spot on identical to the original source bluray.

Now the one thing that is problematic is that some blurays have absolutely TERRIBLE audio mastering.... I'd even say that most of them either have voices to high or music/explosions way to damn bloody high. Seems to be this wild fight between the 2. Also considering that most are 5.1-7.1 mastered with NO consideration of stereo AT ALL, a lot of people playing back those through stereo solutions get a totally unpredictable experience.

My Father for example insists on only ever having stereo, he likes it that way, he has custom made solution with a very powerful amplifier that is strictly old school pure stereo. The failure however is the fact that like I said, most everything nowadays is mastered/tuned for 5.1 or better, making the downmix to stereo sometimes very poor or fair most of the time, occasionally there is some material (rare) that comes out very good in stereo.

I play all my encoders through his system for most of all my stereo tests using the 2nd audio track. For him at least, the boosted depth, audio quality and overall clarity usually creates a nice volume increase as well. In the cases in which I found something kind of ""out of place"", I always double check the physical bluray and see if the bluray itself reproduces the same ""issue"".... and every time, it's just something that people did with the audio at their end, and isn't due to the encode.

Sorry, not likely the answer you are looking for... Not sure it was of any help either."
,buenio,2013-06-16T08:30Z,MR. JUDAS please upload all MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and Bourne Movies thanks.
,eroticburps,2013-06-16T10:16Z,"hey friend.. i do understand the schedule you keep along with other commitments you have to prioritise but pls do something about Judgment Day. sorry if i am pushy. i dont have a blu ray player.. and ppl like you are my only hope to keep beautiful memories like T2 alive. peace mate :)

,joser116,2013-06-16T19:20Z,"Judas, please, Rise of the Guardians :("
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-17T08:31Z,"guys I understand the desire.. I want all these movies as much as you guys do...

but lack of funds..... and real life doesn't always deal you in a good position to do such things..

I have the skynet version of terminator on back order.... when I know I can afford it.. it'll be on it's way.. along with the rise of the guardians..

not to mention numerous others such as Narnia.. underworlds, harry potter and quite a few others.

Still many other movies to get up that have been encoded....

appreciate the compliments and comments and overwhelming desire .... but then again I am just one person..."
,buenio,2013-06-17T14:12Z,@dhjudasx we understand :D take your time to upload movies but when do you relase you expendables 1? coz I saw it in your list of your next upload
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-17T17:57Z,I could upload it soon.... but it's not the extended version.... I was hoping to get my hands on the extended for upload.
,kito67,2013-06-18T09:59Z,"dhjudas, I think it would be an idea to make a tutorial and post a link where it can be seen how to realise a good rip or encode, so many can learn to do these things without asking you daily about what movies they want.Maibe it's time for some of us to do this things alone not to wait and begging for them,not to mention to bad comments"
