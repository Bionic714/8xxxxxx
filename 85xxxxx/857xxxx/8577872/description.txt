           
           The Rolling Stones ΓÇô Hampton Coliseum (Live 1981) (2012) [FLAC]




This performance took place on Keith RichardsΓÇÖ 38th birthday (December 18th 1981) in Hampton Roads, Virginia at the final show of The Rolling StonesΓÇÖ 1981 North American trek supporting their chart-topping Tattoo You album. Long bootlegged, its original recording engineer Bob Clearmountain has gone back to the multi-track tape reels to remix and remaster it especially for official release on http://stonesarchivestore.com this day of February 1st 2012.

Parts of this concert were released in excerpts on the 1982 LP Still Life (American Concert 1981); in particular ΓÇö the blistering take on ΓÇ£ShatteredΓÇ¥, a fun run-through of early Stones favourite ΓÇ£Time Is on My SideΓÇ¥ (their first top-ten hit in the USA, which when re-released in this ΓÇÖ81 incarnation reached number sixty-two on the UK singles chart) and the performance of ΓÇ£LetΓÇÖs Spend the Night TogetherΓÇ¥ where Mick alludes to the Pay-Per-View audience watching at home. That television broadcast infamously showed a fan rushing onto the stage during ΓÇ£SatisfactionΓÇ¥ only to be unceremoniously dispatched by a blow from the backside of Keith RichardsΓÇÖ Telecaster
