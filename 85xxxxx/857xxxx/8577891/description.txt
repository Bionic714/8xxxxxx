Hard rock pioneers Deep Purple bring their power face to face with the London Symphony Orchestra in a concert recorded at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1999.

Joined by such rock luminaries as Ronnie James Dio, Sam Brown and The Steve Morse Band, Deep Purple plays many of their best-loved heavy metal songs, including the rock anthem "Smoke on the Water."

Also highlighted is Deep Purple composer and keyboardist Jon Lord's "Concerto for Group and Orchestra," from the band's very first record, recomposed just for this monumental concert performance.
