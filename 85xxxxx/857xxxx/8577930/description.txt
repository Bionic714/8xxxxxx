Diamonds Are Forever is the soundtrack by John Barry for the seventh James Bond film of the same name.

"Diamonds Are Forever", the title song with lyrics by Don Black, was the second Bond theme to be performed by Shirley Bassey, after "Goldfinger". The song was also recorded in Italian by Bassey as "Una Cascata di Diamanti (Vivo Di Diamanti)"; this version was only issued on 7-inch single in Italy, and is included in a 3-CD box set titled Shirley released in 2012.[2]

Producer Harry Saltzman hated the song and it only made the film due to co-producer Albert Broccoli. One of Saltzman's major objections was to the innuendo in the lyrics.[citation needed] Bassey would later return for a third performance for 1979's Moonraker.
