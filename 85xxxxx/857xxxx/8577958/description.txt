Safety Love by David Drew (CD, Jan-1988, MCA (USA))

"
The album is a a AOR gem with melodic guitars and that 80's feeling.Not sure if all of you have heard it so I decided to share it here...
The album reminds me some of Steve Jones (without the dirty guitars)
and a bit of Billy Idol moments and a little of Giuffria's Silk and Steel touches!!!"
