David Lapham's CALIGULA is a sleek and sexy version of 'Spartacus meets The Exorcist!'

Laurentius survived the Heart of Rome and now Felix's betrayal stands clear in his mind. It was Felix as the Caligula demon that killed Julia and has been manipulating him from the start. But can even a man as noble as Laurentius focus his anger on destroying the demon or will he take out his fury upon the man that willingly slaughtered his wife?
