Natasha and Walter are crew members on a charter flight for a soccer team destined for South America.  The flight is also carrying a secret cargo of two crates of gold.  A team of thugs will impersonate the soccer players and make it look like the plane crashed to divert the plane and take possession of the cargo.

After a missed landing in the Amazon rainforest, Natasha is separated from the rest of the group and falls into the hands of Indian guyapos, the dreaded head-hunters.

Walter will escape and join Natasha who managed to coax the tribe of the guyapos to join her. They use the natives to thwart the plans of the bandits, free the rest of the crew, and recover the gold.
