Shipping Wars: Season 1 
Each episode of "Shipping Wars" dives into the cutthroat world of heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport the unshippable. The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.




2)  Double Down and Bean Town 
When shipments hit the auction block, the Bawcoms score a shipment for a 35 foot freshwater boat while Roy gets stuck transporting an old English phone booth after he tries to teach Jarrett a lesson. But when the Bawcoms try to double their earnings by taking on a second large boat, they may sink the entire shipment.
