ReleaseNotes:

The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, again produced by Nick Raskulinecz, who did Black Gives Way to Blue, finds Alice in Chains digging in the dirt on songs like the methodical title track, "Lab Monkey," and "Stone."

"There's some real filth in there. That's intentional, and that's also just how we
sound together," Cantrell says of the record's deep, gritty sound. "We're trying to
make a record that we dig and we're trying to keep the bar high for ourselves and see if we can get past it, and I think that we did again. And of course you want people to dig it too and to respond to it, and to have that start happening is satisfying."

It's started happening with the lead single and opening track, "Hollow," which hit
Number One on the rock radio charts. Despite the fact that Alice in Chains' forays
into the murky waters have consistently proven to lead to both commercial and radio
success, Cantrell was still pleasantly surprised by the song's immediate acceptance.

"The initial response to 'Hollow' has been fucking incredible, totally not what we
intended, and that's fucking awesome," he says. "We just put that song out there for the fans and then it ended up turning into a number one single, a six-minute sludgy metal tune. That's always fun, to see something like that happen."

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic.
HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist.
We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
