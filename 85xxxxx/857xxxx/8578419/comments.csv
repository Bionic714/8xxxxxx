,frostyon420,2013-06-16T05:53Z,How did u get a green patch with only 1 page of torrents
,frostyon420,2013-06-16T08:31Z,fuck u dick i dump my crunchyroll stream with rtmpdump. and decode the xml file to dump subs using a python script. i don't need to steal content from horriblesubs i understand how to do shit myself.  kinda messed up that u accused me of that before knowing the facts. all i did was ask a question
,frostyon420,2013-06-16T08:37Z,Also check my torrent i uploaded todays episode after the crunchyroll simulcast....right afterwards. before horriblesubs upload im sure
,frostyon420,2013-06-16T08:40Z,all i wanted to know is how u got the patch so soon before u attacked my torrent. thats all
,frostyon420,2013-06-16T08:50Z,in fact now that i read ur description u dont even rip ur own shows and u attack me????????

,bawbzor,2013-06-16T09:18Z,What a boring episode
[V],QborT,2013-06-16T16:42Z,"bawbzor, they can't all be filled with blood and thunder.  This episode was a tension builder with a HUGE cliffhanger at the end... Personally I thought it was pretty cool how they ended the episode, it's all about anticipation and story."
