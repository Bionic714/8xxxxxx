Grojband - Season 1 - Episode 5 (WEB-DL - 480p)
-----------------------------------------------

Twelve year old Corey (Core) Riffen starts a garage band with his three best friends
and quickly realizes that their band sucks - like a lot. ItΓÇÖs not their music or
ever-changing image that's the problem. It's Corey's lack of lyrics. He just can't
think of anything cool to write about, until... he finds his older sister Trina's
diary. "Hey! This thing is full of teen angst and junk." Core and the band
'secretly' use her latest diary entry for lyrics to their new tune - and what do
you know? It sounds like pure awesomeness and the gigs are lining up! Problem solved
right? Not exactly. Trina's a total witch and can't stand the thought of her little
brother's garbage band becoming more popular than her. She'll stop at nothing to
crush their dreams. But that's cool. Core can read his sister, well... like a book.
And he always knows just what to do to make her go diary and give them the one thing
they're missing... words! Follow Corey and his GROJBAND as they reach for the top.
Gasp at the things they'll do to his sister's fragile teenage world to get there.

The only way the band is gonna eat the tallest wedding cake in town
is by becoming a wedding band! Trina sells them out, saying Corey
has never been in love and could never sing about it!

Grojband is set to play the Swiss Alpine Horn and Chocowatch Expo...
too bad Corey's voice is cracking! Worried, Corey puts on an
auto-tuning helmet, which Trina promptly sets to "evil".
