[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-16T20:50Z,"let me know what you think BruceWayneJr! i'm not a huge fan of this series (particularly the art) but it has its loyal fans...

MemberJLA, sorry but i don't have any of those. the captain universe reprint special is one of those that are often passed over by the scanners... however, much of its material was reprinted in the trade Captain Universe Power Unimaginable several years ago, and you can grab that trade in one of my old torrents:  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8277358/"
