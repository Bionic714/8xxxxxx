Shipping Wars: Season 1 
Each episode of "Shipping Wars" dives into the cutthroat world of heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport the unshippable. The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.




3)  Cash for Tanks 
After Marc battles it our with the other transporters, he wins a load of two Military tanks headed across the country and Roy lands a mint condition Model A being shipped from one collector to another. After Marc quickly loads up the tanks, he's got to find his way through a maze of round-a-bouts in a small Pennsylvania town before he even makes it to the highway. Roy has to make this delivery and get back home in time for his son's graduation, but when he's caught up in one of the worst storms in history, will he damage the load and find himself out of pocket for this priceless antique?
