If youΓÇÖve ever dieted, youΓÇÖve undoubtedly worked very hard to achieve results--only to experience the disappointment of having the pounds creep back on. But now wellness expert Kathy Freston lets readers in on her secret: losing weight doesnΓÇÖt have to be difficult, and it can last.

With this book she shares the powerful concept of The Lean--a radically effective approach to positive change--with a practical 30-day plan to transform your health and jump-start weight loss in the most gentle, easy, and automatic way possible.

ΓÇ£Leaning inΓÇ¥ is about setting an intention for what you want, weight- and health-wise, and then nudging yourself ever so gently in that direction, even if getting there seems impossible. ItΓÇÖs about choosing to eat foods that are delicious, filling, and supportive of your goals.
