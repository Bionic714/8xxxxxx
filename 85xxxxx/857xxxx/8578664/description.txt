Don Camillo is the main character created by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi (1908ΓÇô68), and is based on the historical Roman Catholic priest, WW II partisan and detainee of the concentration camps of Dachau and Mauthausen, Don Camillo Valota. 
Don Camillo is one of two protagonists, the other being the communist mayor of the town, known to everyone as Peppone. 
The stories are set in what Guareschi refers to as a "small world" and are an excellent representation of what rural Italy was like after the second world war. 
 
A series of black-and-white films were made between 1952 and 1965. 
These were French-Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. 
Don Camillo was played by French actor Fernandel, Peppone by the Italian actor Gino Cervi. 
The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors.
