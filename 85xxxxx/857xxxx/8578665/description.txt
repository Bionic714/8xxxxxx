Information
------------------------------

In the heart of the Pacific, Clipperton is the most isolated atoll on earth and remains a scientific enigma. How did life manage to take root on this tiny French territory off the coast of Mexico and how did it survive in this unique ecosystem? Over a four month expedition led by Doctor Jean-Louis Etienne, researchers from all fields have gathered a living inventory of the island, an absolute necessity in order to understand and set up measures to protect biodiversity on a global scale. This unique oasis draws a large number of sharks, millions of scarlet crabs, rats and thousands of birds...all voraciously struggling to survive turning the island into an hostile and fragile environment The hope is to continue the exploratory mission on a long-term scale to make Clipperton a permanent observatory of evolution in a sea environment.
