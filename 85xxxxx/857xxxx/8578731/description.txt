Uploader's note:
These DVDs alone will not be complete without the textbooks, flashcards, workbooks, and other printed materials. So, I would suggest you to buy all these in the company's website. They occasionally provide 50% discount (esp. in summers). It is definitely one of the best preschool materials out there. It's worth every penny. See this link for the ultimate pack:
