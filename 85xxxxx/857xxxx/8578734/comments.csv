,OregonWest,2013-06-17T05:35Z,Suck it. Rifftrax rules. You are an asshole that doesnt understand that and No One is forcing you to watch it shit for brains. Go complain about not wanting free shit somewhere else until you figure out what Rifftrax is you retarded cunt.
,Boogurz,2013-06-17T08:50Z,"Yes, Rifftrax rules, but riffs not done my Mike/Kevin/Bill suck donkey ass!

People doing a search for new Rifftrax get this dogshit cluttering up their search results."
,anoyed12,2013-06-17T09:41Z,@Boogurz This is riffed by Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy you dolt.
,Boogurz,2013-06-17T15:16Z,"But no Mike.

Gotta be all 3 or gtfo, imo."
,OregonWest,2013-06-17T20:52Z,"Boogurz- I owe you an apology. I did not understand that your opinion outweighed the the facts and that even though listed on the Rifftrax website and includes the performers, your opinion means more than every one else's facts. I cant imagine what went wrong in your life to make your ego so inflated that you are incapable of feeling that shame you deserve. Your opinion means nothing to the rest of us. Good thing you never heard of MST3K, they had a guy named Joel before Mike, who started it all and Bill came many years later which in your ignorant means GTFO. ( I am so astounded by your stupidity and narcissism)."
