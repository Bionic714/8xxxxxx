Bates Motel is an American drama television series developed for television by Carlton Cuse, Kerry Ehrin and Anthony Cipriano, produced by Universal Television for A&E.


The series, being a "contemporary prequel"to the 1960 film Psycho (based on Robert Bloch's novel of the same name), depicts the life of Norman Bates and his mother Norma prior to the events portrayed in Hitchcock's film, albeit in a different fictional town ("White Pine Bay, Oregon," as opposed to the film's "Fairvale, California") and in a modern, 21st-century setting. The series begins after the death of Norma's husband, when she purchases a motel located in a coastal Oregon town so she and Norman can start a new life.

The series was filmed in Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada and premiered on March 18, 2013, at 10 pm ET/PT. A&E chose to skip a pilot of the series, opting to go straight-to-series by ordering a 10-episode first season.

On April 8, 2013, A&E renewed Bates Motel for a second season, following favourable reviews and strong ratings. It is set to air in 2014 and filming will begin in the summer (July/August) of 2013.
