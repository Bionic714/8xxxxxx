The Complete Fantastic Four by Mark Millar is a new digital collection of Millar's complete 16-issue run on Fantastic Four in one easy-to-read volume.

This is a completely new digital collection, and even though the resolution is not as high as some existing scans might be, the colors are more true.

This unique digital omnibus collects the entire run in 370 pages, comprised of Fantastic Four #554-569 as well as some interesting articles including 2 Mark Millar interviews and a Bryan Hitch interview which preceded the series.

This collection is essential reading before "The Complete Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman" 2-book collection as it introduces several characters and concepts core to that run.
