The Complete Fantastic Four by Jonathan Hickman is a new digital collection of Hickman's complete run on Fantastic Four and FF in two easy-to-read volumes.

The pages of these volumes are comprised of both existing scans and all-new new digital pages (for cases where the available scans were of lower quality -- even though the resolution is not as high as some existing scans might be, the colors are more true). Many thanks to the original scanners for their excellent work.

These unique digital omnibuses collect the Hickman Fantastic Four and FF runs in 1280 pages split into two volumes, including:

Fantastic Four #570-587, #600-611, & #605.1
FF #1-23
...presented in the proper reading order as noted by Hickman himself.

Also included are several articles on the series - including a great interview with Jonathan Hickman - and tons of bonus artwork including full-page cover art and a complete showcase of the Fantastic Four 600 Hero Initiative variants (100+ covers!).
