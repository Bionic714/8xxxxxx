TypeTool

TypeTool is our basic font editor for Mac OS and for Windows. For students, hobby typographers and creative professionals who occasionally need to create or customize fonts.

includes support for OpenType fonts with up to 65,000 glyphs, Unicode 5.0 support, new bitmap Background and outline Mask layers, improved BÃ©zier drawing with open contours and tangent points, multi-line metrics and kerning editing, superb screen quality autohinting, better printouts, and much more.

Create new fonts or modify existing fonts, open any fonts installed on your system (improved in version 3).

Open and generate PostScript Type 1 and TrueType fonts.

Open and generate PostScript-flavored (CFF/.otf) and TrueType-flavored (.ttf) OpenType fonts (new in version 3). Note: The ability to edit the advanced typographic OpenType Layout features is not included in TypeTool, so other tools such as FontLab Studio, Microsoft VOLT or Adobe FDK for OpenType need to be used.
