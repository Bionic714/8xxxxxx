With so many thousands upon thousands of people, you'd think I'd get more than $3 in donations for the best rips online. So before anyone asks, no, no main card from me this time. Maybe next time if people want to help put in the money. There's always next time though. Just be sure if you want UFC events you keep tabs on my Twitter @Secludedly or my site Secludedly.Wordpress.Com"

And here i was selfishly downloading every single release of you without even thinking about it. I will be donating in the future man, thanks so much for your hard work"
,Ghettoescu,2013-06-16T23:47Z,"WoW! I didn't even watch the card, because i thought you will upload the whole thing. I didn't even knew that you are relying on donations for the PPV. I will try to help next time. You have the greatest releases ever. I'm saving all the content on my hdd, your content... and when i see 30fps releases from the other guys, i start punching the monitor. 60fps has the greatest fluidity for me. Thanks again and i regret that i don't have your release.."
