Debbie Gibson never recorded anything as sexy as Britney Spears's white-funk smoker "...Baby One More Time." Unfortunately, neither does the 17-year-old Spears's debut album contain anything else that remotely approaches that instant hit single. A few of the disc's cuts are pleasantly catchy, but too much of its space is given over to icky ballads ("E-Mail My Heart"?) and other unconvincing moves such as the dancehall-lite "Soda Pop." --Rickey Wright.
