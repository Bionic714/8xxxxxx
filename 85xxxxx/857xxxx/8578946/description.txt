Big Brother's Prying Eyes-PBS Moyers & Company-061413-mp4.PTC

Whatever your take on the recent revelations about government spying on our phone calls and Internet activity, thereΓÇÖs no denying that Big Brother is bigger and less brotherly than we thought. WhatΓÇÖs the resulting cost to our privacy ΓÇö and more so, our democracy? Lawrence Lessig, professor of law and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University and founder of Stanford Law SchoolΓÇÖs Center for Internet and Society, discusses the implications of our governmentΓÇÖs actions, Edward SnowdenΓÇÖs role in leaking the information, and steps we must take to better protect our privacy.

ΓÇ£Snowden describes agents having the authority to pick and choose who theyΓÇÖre going to be following on the basis of their hunch about what makes sense and what doesnΓÇÖt make sense. This is the worst of both worlds. We have a technology now that gives them access to everything, but a culture if again itΓÇÖs true that encourages them to be as wide ranging as they can,ΓÇ¥ Lessig tells Bill. ΓÇ£The question is ΓÇö are there protections or controls or counter technologies to make sure that when the government gets access to this information they canΓÇÖt misuse it in all the ways that, you know, anybody who remembers Nixon believes and fears governments might use?ΓÇ¥

Few are as knowledgeable about the impact of the Internet on our public and private lives as Lessig, who argues that government needs to protect American rights with the same determination and technological sophistication it uses to invade our privacy and root out terrorists.

ΓÇ£If we donΓÇÖt have technical measures in place to protect against misuse, this is just a trove of potential misuseΓÇªWeΓÇÖve got to think about the technology as a protector of liberty too. And the government should be implementing technologies to protect our liberties,ΓÇ¥ Lessig says. ΓÇ£Because if they donΓÇÖt, we donΓÇÖt figure out how to build that protection into the technology, it wonΓÇÖt be there.ΓÇ¥

ΓÇ£We should recognize in a world of terrorism the governmentΓÇÖs going to be out there trying to protect us. But letΓÇÖs make sure that theyΓÇÖre using tools or technology that also protects the privacy side of what they should be protecting.ΓÇ¥

A former conservative whoΓÇÖs now a liberal, Lessig also knows that the caustic impact of money is another weapon capable of mortally wounding democracy. His recent book, Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress ΓÇö and a Plan to Stop It, decries a pervasive ΓÇ£dependence corruptionΓÇ¥ in our government and politics that should sound a desperate alarm for both the Left and the Right. Here, Lessig outlines a radical approach to the problem that uses big money itself to reform big money-powered corruption.
