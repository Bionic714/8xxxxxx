  "Born in the hour of India's freedom.        
   Handcuffed to history."                     
   At the stroke of midnight on August 15,     
   1947, as India proclaims independence       
   from Great Britain, two newborn babies      
   are switched by a nurse in a Bombay         
   hospital. Saleem Sinai, the illegitimate    
   son of a poor woman, and Shiva, the         
   offspring of a wealthy couple, are fated    
   to live the destiny meant for each other.   
   Their lives become mysteriously             
   intertwined and are inextricably linked     
   to India's whirlwind journey of triumphs    
   and disasters.
