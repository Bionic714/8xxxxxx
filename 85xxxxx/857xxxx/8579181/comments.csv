,Rizzano,2013-06-17T02:06Z,Mods aren't working.  I clicked launch and it updated.  Thought this was already 1.5.2?  When I launched it originally it said 1.4.
,Jetlized,2013-06-17T02:34Z,"@Ahrimann Is the server cracked? If not, that is your problem. :)"
,misha553,2013-06-17T08:27Z,"@Rizzano You are executing YOUR antique minecraft version.. If u have another minecraft installed in appdata/roaming/.minecraft and u click the minecraft launcher.exe of other .minecraft folder like mine u will execute the minecraft from the .minecraft in romaing folder.. You can do two things... unistalls your old minecraft of cut and put in on other folder and put my .minecraft. 
This torrent dont have any problem u can join any private server and if u didnt see on the menu the 50 mods loaded 50 mods active u did something wrong.. xD"
,Rizzano,2013-06-17T08:42Z,"@misha553: Never had Minecraft installed on this laptop before, so how is it updating an old one?"
,Rizzano,2013-06-17T08:57Z,"@misha553: It's working now. You should be more CLEAR with your instructions. In step 2 it says put the .minecraft folder ANY PLACE YOU WANT.  I kept putting it on my desktop, so when I launched it, it would check my appdata/roaming for the .minecraft folder and when it didn't find one, it would create a new default one and download it and run THAT one without the mods.  Next time be more clear in saying that you NEED to put the .minecraft folder in the AppData/Roaming folder."
,misha553,2013-06-17T09:23Z,"@Rizzano Not all computer are the same i used the two ways and worked for me. Anyway.. is a rare issue but easly fixed.. I spend several days in making my minecraft the most free bug posible with the best 50 mods i found, and that texture pack that i think is the best there, and i decided to share it with my friend and all other users. And u complain for a 2 minutes fix? come on think about it. Im not getting angry but i dont like ungrateful ppl."
,SkrillexFX,2013-06-17T19:05Z,What the fuck? is 1.5.2 or 1.4 ??
