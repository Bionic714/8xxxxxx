 Suraj starts his career by doing              
 odd jobs. He soon realizes that the           
 film world looks good and glamorous           
 from the outside but has its fair share       
 of struggle. He also realizes that his one    
 decision of rejecting a well-paid job to      
 follow his dream has cost his family dearly.
