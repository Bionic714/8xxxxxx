Many thanks to Konashine for uploading the entire season, and, of course, to the rippers CTU, IMMERSE and ORENJI.

I had some aac problems while compressing, so some of the files have aac, but some have Ogg Vorbis.

I recommend using VLC for playing these files.

I might upload the second season if you guys want.


SEED AND ENJOY!!
