Notes ....: This Extended version was released for the first time
            this month. We didn't see any indication afore hand that
            this one is going to be different from our earlier release.
            There are numerous reasons why it's so worthy of another rip
            just 2 months after the theatrical one.

           1) Extended - ~7mins longer
           2) Picture quality - leaps and bounds superior
              pq on this new disc (see Proof dir for comparison)
              Crisp, sharp and compressed a lot better too
              Note that it's been formatted to 1:1.78 for this release
           3) Audio - DTS 1509 5.1 vs 2.0 with lower bitrate on
              previous source

            Source didn't have english subs (there are no foreign parts
            anyway), but we ocr'd an .srt off a retail DVD anyway.
