Electrodynamics is a Minecraft mod which adds some very unique game mechanics that will both challenge the player as well as immerse them in a whole new world of ore processing. Our todo list for the public beta release alone is several pages long, and we expect the beta to be much longer.

In order to ensure players can thoroughly enjoy Electrodynamics the way we intended them to, I have been putting together a website that will contain all the info you need; recipes, ore and world gen, multiblocks, armor and much more. There will be no lack of documentation, I can assure you.

The site is currently being updated so feel free to keep an eye on it for a sneak peak at upcoming features. For those of you who didn't know we had a website, I tried to make it a little more clear...
