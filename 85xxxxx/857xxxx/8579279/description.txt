User Reviews

Being a huge fan of the original movie, The Emperor's New Groove, I was thrilled to find that a sequel had been made. I bought the movie thinking that, at its worst, it would have some familiar characters and a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. However, I was delighted to find that it was as good as it could be without being the original classic. For those who weren't fans of the first movie, this may be such a good choice as there are many 'in jokes' and nods to the original. Also the plot is quite complicated for a cartoon, effectively covering three stories in the one film. However, the music is fantastic, opening with a very original and funky tune 'You Should Be True To Your Groove' and continuing with a fabulous jazz piece sung by the talented Eartha Kitt and a classic track by Earth Wind and Fire. This is a movie that works on different levels, so that parents will not be bored when watching it with their children. There are a couple of cringe-worthy moments, perhaps aiming for a young teen market but these can be easily overlooked. Overall a really great movie with some brilliant and original moments.
