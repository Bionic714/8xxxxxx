,Freakando,2013-06-17T16:42Z,"Hey! 

I have a 10.8.4 and it doesn't work well. 

It starts and all, but there's a glitch in the texture that makes the game unplayable...

Any solution? 

thanks!"
[T],failzone,2013-06-18T04:07Z,"@albert358 since you have nvidia, you should install phys  x on the port. you can do this by 

app-> package contents-> click wineskin.app -> advanced -> 2nd tab -> winetricks -> search ""phys x"" -> check the box -> click run -> when dialog box comes up (do you wish to run ...) click ok -> wait -> when done, launch again"
,albert358,2013-06-18T11:45Z,"@failzone Thanks for the help, but the error isn't clear. I was install Phys X and launch the game then but i haven't got sound...."

Any ideas?"
[T],failzone,2013-06-19T06:05Z,"you do not have to benchmark, although the settings might be gray, you can still change them"
[T],failzone,2013-06-19T06:10Z,it may not work on ati video cards
[T],failzone,2013-06-19T06:21Z,"if you have graphic problems, try turning off dedicated video cards and play with only integrated video such as intel hd 4000 as it works the best in intel hd drivers.
