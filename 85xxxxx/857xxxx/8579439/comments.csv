99.8% for me too, guys.   But that should be 
enough for you to watch all of it. I know I was 
certainly able to!

But that's all I have.  That's t. You can go home now!"
,BrezNJ,2013-06-17T02:11Z,"Agreed it's stuck @ 99.8%. It is amazing to see the zaniness of these 2 actors. The show was a lot of fun until 30.20 when the audio dropped out (just as Martin finished his 2nd song), but I watched the rest for the heck of it. Thanks again for the post."
[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-17T04:19Z,"The audio dropped out a half-hour in??  Not for me.

That not quite making it to 100% never happened 
with one of my torrents before.  Maybe the poor 
video quality of the source material had something to do with this one."
,chrys56,2013-06-17T13:43Z,"Ditto to audio dropping out...happened as BrezNJ said, right after Martin finishes the second song.  Any chance of a repair and re-post? Thx."

[V],TheExecutive,2013-06-17T15:47Z,"Thanks for doing that easy Google-investigating, chrys56 !   I've said many times that these Colgate
 shows are all in the public domain, and that You 
Tube is the place to get them from. That's how I got
 them including this one, with an app that downloads You Tube videoes."
