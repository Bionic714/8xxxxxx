After Eddie Cantor hosted the premiere show a week earlier,
the second episode of The Colgate Comedy Hour is also the 
first-ever for Dean & Jerry! This aired on September 17, 1950.

Dean's uncle comedian Leonard Barr does an odd dance after his nephew's
second song, which is really out of place and seems pointless!

The closing monolog (if any) and the end theme are missing.
