Information
------------------------------

Breathing new life into the traditional civics lesson, Peter Sagal, host of NPR's "Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me," travels across the country on a Harley Davidson to find out where the U.S. Constitution lives, how it works and how it doesn't ... how it unites us as a nation and how it has nearly torn us apart. Sagal introduces some major constitutional debates today and talks with ordinary Americans and leading constitutional experts about what the Constitution actually says and what it means, the dramatic historical events and crises that have defined it, and why all this matters.


1)  A More Perfect Union 
In A More Perfect Union, Peter Sagal explores the Constitution's most striking and innovative feature: its resilient brand of federalism. The framers created a strong national government while at the same time preserving much of the power and independence of the states. This delicate balance of power, seemingly hard-wired for disagreement and conflict, has served America well for more than two centuries. Let's take a closer look at how it has also led to tensions throughout American history and still sparks controversy today over medical marijuana, gun control, and Obamacare.

2)  It's a Free Country 
Ask Americans what the Constitution's most important feature is, and most will say it's the guarantees of liberty enshrined in the Bill of Rights. In this episode, Peter Sagal explores the history of the Bill of Rights, and also takes on several stories ripped from the headlines, involving freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and right to privacy. Let's take a closer look and see how freedom is defined for "We the People" as well as you the citizen.

3)  Created Equal 
In this episode of CONSTITUTION USA, Peter Sagal explores the high ideals of the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal," endowed with "unalienable rights," that didn't make it into the Constitution in 1787. It took three-quarters of a century, and a bloody civil war, before the Fourteenth Amendment of 1868 made equality a constitutional right, and gave the federal government the power to enforce it. The far-reaching changes created by that amendment established new notions of citizenship, equal protection, due process, and personal liberty and today those notions are being used to fight for same sex marriage, voting rights, affirmative action, and immigration reform. Let's take a closer look and see how equality is defined in this episode.

4)  Built to Last? 
In this last episode, Peter Sagal travels to Iceland where a few years after the country's economic collapse, leaders decided to create a new constitution, turning to the U.S. Constitution for inspiration. This prompts Peter to consider why our own founding document has been able to last for more than 225 years. He looks at the systems that have kept the Constitution healthy--amendments, judicial interpretation, checks and balances -and also at the political forces that threaten to undermine the framers' vision: excessive partisanship leading to gridlock, money in politics, and gerrymandering. Does our Constitution stand up to the 21st Century? Have we lost the art of democratic deliberation? How are you represented - and does your voice get heard?
