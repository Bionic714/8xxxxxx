The only true multi-lingual keyboard - type in up to three
languages simultaneously

“Shockingly accurate, making for a creepy-fast typing
experience.” - TIME Magazine

“I canâ™t recommend SwiftKey highly enough.” - CNET

SwiftKey replaces the touchscreen keyboard on your phone
with one that understands how words work together, giving
the worldâ™s most accurate autocorrect - and predicting
your next word before you press a key.

The keyboard learns as you use it to make corrections and
predictions based on the way that you write. It can learn from
your Gmail, Facebook, Twitter or blog to make its insights
even more personalized. You can also enable up to three
languages simultaneously, for true multi-lingual typing.

Switch seamlessly between tapping and gesture typing with
our new SwiftKey Flow feature. It combines the mind-reading
capabilities of SwiftKey with the speed of gliding your fingers
across the screen. With ‘Flow Through Spaceâ™, you can
also enter entire phrases without lifting your finger from the
screen, simply by sliding to the space bar between words.
