,zdera,2013-06-16T15:58Z,will this one work on 32bit win7?
,gxrylgx,2013-06-16T16:23Z,"Same issue, just stops responding. Even went as far as manually removing the ""Read-Only"" flag for every file, and unblocking each file. This only managed to get tunnel to run when ZZEE started up but then it goes right to (Not Responding)

Also using Win7 64-Bit"

,AtraxS16,2013-06-16T20:04Z,"Thank you for the upload.
I must ask before I download, is this the same as the original release from vulpeszedra v1.2?
Because that one is beta with limited regions, features, no regional trade or sharing, and so on... 

Or is this the full game with regional features working?"
,AtraxS16,2013-06-16T21:08Z,"Yup, it's the same BETA, no point in playing this. Once you expand too much and your resources are gone, you are either doomed or going in circles, because you can't trade with your other cities in the region.
Waiting for the full game release.
Thnx for the upload anyways."

,milkover,2013-06-18T10:46Z,"The game works. After hours of playing though, there seems to be a bug that auto quit to the main menu (about 40-50 minutes of playing time), and if you try to resume playing,  it will show an error: ""Unable to load city at this time. Please try again later."" The problem might be related to offline save function. If anyone knows a fix, please help, thank you. This DRMless masterpiece is quite close to perfect. "
