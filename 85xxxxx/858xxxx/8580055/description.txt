Mammoth Mystery
Scientists have long debated one of the greatest mysteries of science. What caused the mass extinction of mammoths around 13,000 years ago? A look at science in the making, National Geographic follows a team of investigators as they assemble one theory for what might have happened to the mammoths, which reigned over the landscapes of North America for more than 1 million years. Could the clues point to the biggest cosmic impact humans have ever witnessed?
In 1962, paleontologists uncovered the rarest of Ice Age fossils in the Nebraska badlands: two complete male mammoths locked in a death grip by their 12-foot-long tusks. What made them fight? And why did they die together? Following forensic clues, paleontologists determine the sex and age of the mammoths, the time of year of their deadly battle, and how their violent clash doomed them.
