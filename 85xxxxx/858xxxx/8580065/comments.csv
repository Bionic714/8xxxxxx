,Killher,2013-06-16T18:02Z,"SHUT THE FUCK UP GULISA. It's a BRAND NEW torrent. You are fucking blessed to even lay your eyes on this torrent. The reason it won't download is because of people like you. Complaining about d/l speeds when YOU'RE NOT SEEDING EITHER. So set this shit to d/l, and find something else to do with your life faggot."
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-06-16T18:04Z,"@gulisa: Stop spamming, its seeding and there is much seeders right know including my servers.

Any Ideas?"
[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-06-16T19:35Z,"If you get server cant start ect, make sure you right click on SIMCITY folder and properties then in the window UN-CHECK Read-only.

@shakatrok: Try that i wrote above and then run start.exe and make sure all 3 ports are green and start server.

For ""Dummy certificate is not installed"" error, try Install Certificate again, step 4."

,AtraxS16,2013-06-16T20:08Z,"Thank you for the upload.
I must ask before I download, is this the same as the original release from vulpeszedra v1.2?
Because that one is beta with limited regions, features, no regional trade or sharing, and so on... 

Or is this the full game with regional features working?"
,moeburn1,2013-06-16T20:09Z,"Is the included Origin installer cracked/different in any way, or can I just use the Origin I already have installed on my PC?  Does it need internet access, or can I use my existing user/pass offline?"

,TheTorrentter,2013-06-16T20:12Z,vmware workstation privent the server from working because it uses the port 443 you should disable VM or uninstall it
[T],Roobb,2013-06-16T20:26Z,Thanks for this. Works great!
,AtraxS16,2013-06-16T20:31Z,"@Roobb  Can you confirm if this is the beta version or the full version of the game?
Thank you."
,AtraxS16,2013-06-16T21:10Z,"Yup, it's the same BETA, no point in playing this. Once you expand too much and your resources are gone, you are wither doomed or going in circles, because you can't trade with your other cities in the region. Also, you have no use of tourism, gambling or things like that.
Waiting for the full game release.
Thnx for the upload anyways."
,ravupadh,2013-06-16T21:14Z,Is this torrent more updated and better than this one: http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8558755/SIMCITY_2013_DRMLESS_CRACKED-VULPESZEDRA

,grasakk,2013-06-16T21:33Z,"ALL is OK,if u a having problems whit origin,yust reinstal origin and log in and you can download game.
If u wanna back ur original origin games,yust delete hosts file in C:WindowsSystem32Driversetc
and u will have ur original origin games back,when u wanna play simcity yust again repleace hosts fine in C:WindowsSystem32Driversetc whit one provided in Extras folder."
,hgepotato,2013-06-16T21:47Z,"I downloaded and I confirm it works but hell it was lot of struggle to make it work. Restarting, deleting origin, game, reinstalling. Damn I don't even know what exactly I did to make it work. Propably clicking  Activate button made it work because before I couldn't start, it gave me an error. Thank you for release Stif. Anyway, this game is huge dissapointment for me, I say after playing tutorial. What's more, without online this game is pretty much crap."
,AtraxS16,2013-06-16T21:58Z,"@ravupadh Nope, it still remains the beta, because allot of the features are missing, not just regions.
Full retail game has arround 4GB.

Don't get me wrong, this is OK to play, it works, it's fine, but after a few hours you reach limitations of one city, and then you should expand to other cities in the region and trade amongs them, but that just doesn't work.
In my opinion, this is great for someone who wan'ts to try before buying, just to see how things work.
I will buy it, it's a cool game, but not nearly as difficult as SimCity 4. It's much more simplified, but still fun, specially playing with friends."
,D0gmeat,2013-06-16T22:06Z,"Remember even if you got this thing to work, bear in mind the retail game still is rife with bugs and unresolved game issues. If and when a new patch is released, you will need to redo all of this to get the game updated."

,andsur,2013-06-16T22:10Z,"System requirements can be found here : http://checkrequirements.com/game/simcity-2013-pc
Thx stif !"
,ravupadh,2013-06-16T23:10Z,@AtraxS16 How is it beta though if it's 1.5? And also I think region play requires online connectivity which has to do with the pirate game being played offline.
,AtraxS16,2013-06-17T00:30Z,"@ravupadh It is a 1.5 version of the CRACK. The original game is currently at 4.0.1 version.
Yes, in original game you have to be connected whatever you play, but if this version of the game was a full release, you would be able to use regional features IF you choose private server, so not with friends, just your region and your cities in that region. That doesn't require connection, because it is all on your local server, virtual in this case.
Look, try it out, and you'll see.
There are 3 torrents so far on tpb for this version of the game, all the same and all pretty much misslabeled.
The original uploader of this version labeled it correctly, he said it was beta, but everyone else who uploaded it later on actually write in notes that it is a full game.
I don't care, but it is missleading. And since none of the uploaders answered to my question if this is the beta, I'll assume it is.
If you start to download the game, you'll see in the list of files in utorrent that the zipped files are labeled as BETA.
Cheers."
,Timbo6669,2013-06-17T03:07Z,"Atrax - What are you? the title/label police?? who cares how exact the title is...its free, cracked yet still complain...yes, this has many features disabled because of the online play is disabled...not hard to figure out..and its small, so download and see for yourself instead of being a tool.."
,Timbo6669,2013-06-17T03:08Z,not once does it say its the 1.5 version of 'the game'...its how you read and comprehend it...it CLEARLY says Cracked.1.5-.blabla..not - Simcity v1.5...idiot..

,ravupadh,2013-06-17T05:24Z,So this is still just the beta version of the game? What a piece of shit. Might as well go and buy the game by myself.

[V],Mr.Stifmeister,2013-06-17T08:39Z,"This is the full game, but the server emu is beta, so some stuff may not work.
And if you get errors like server cant start, make sure the filepath to start.exe dont have any spaces.
So i recommend placing the SIMCITY folder directly inside your HDD, so the filepatch becomes C:SIMCITY .

But as Timbo6669 says, its totolly playable and enjoyable :D"

,AtraxS16,2013-06-17T14:12Z,"@Timbo6669  Chill, dude. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that it doesn't say anywhere that this is limited release.
I did try the game back when it was 1.2 when the original cracker uploaded it, and yes it works, nor did I ever say it DOESN'T WORK! 
Idiot, read my posts, and then say what you need to say, dumbass.
It's still barely playable version of the game.
I'm not a ""label"" police, but I think EVERYONE would benefit if there were correct and precise descriptions and labels, that's the wholew point.
Upload a torrent that is misslabeled, an you'll get allot of crap from allot of people. Not everyone has unlimited bandwith and data plans, people would like to know what they are downloading, and that's the only reason I wrote what I wrote."

,OuTSiDeRs,2013-06-17T18:43Z,"Hello everybody we are new here and willing to help :D...
First off:
1.Make sure you followed the instructions exactly as its says
2.Make your ""SIMCITY"" folder placed in local drive(example: ""c://"")
3.Uncheck read-only of SIMCITY folder and override it
4.Make sure that you have installed given Origin and not other version(IMPORTANT!)
5.And most important of all before starting server be sure to click on ""ACTIVATE""
and then on start server.
6.Optional: turn Origin in offline mode
7.Optional: turn off show Origin in Game option in Origin itself
8.Optional: Run Origin and Server as Admin
TIP: Reinstall Certificate anytime you feel like needing to

Please try again later."" The problem might be related to offline save function. If anyone knows a fix, please help, thank you. This DRMless masterpiece is quite close to perfect. "

also got that error message. i have managed to solve that problem by making the simcity folder located at C:Program FilesOrigin GamesSimCity not read only. after you start the server, try to run the game again. if the problem still persist, press the activate button from start.exe"
,tomix16,2013-06-18T12:41Z,"Une fois le tout télécharger, on procède comme ceci !!

- Installez le fichier SimCity 5 à la racine de votre disque dur, en générale c'est C:
- Renomez le dossier en SimCity
- Allez dans le dossier SimCity que vous venez de renommez et continuez dans Extra, double clic sur le fichier Electronic Arts, Inc CA.crt (dossier Extra )et certifier le fichier , faire Placer les certificats dans le magasin suivant , et sélectionne Autorité de certification racines de confiance.
- Toujours dans le dossier Extra, on trouve un fichier Host, ouvrez le avec notepad ou bloc note et copié ce qui il a dedans, on peux très bien faire un copié de ce fichier et ecrasez l'autre mais pour ceux qui ont déjà inscrit des adresses dedans cela permet de les conserver !! donc allez ensuite ICI C:Windows, System32, Drivers, Etc et ouvrez toujours le fichier host avec notepad ou bloc note et copiez les adresses à la suite des autres !!
- Pour ceux qui ont skype, on peux desactiver les ports 80 et 443 en allant tout simplement dans Outils, Options, Avancées, Connexion et là on décoche et on relance son skype !!
- Copiez les fichiers que vous avez téléchargé sur le patch 1.5 et coller les dans le dossier SimCity.
- Faites un clic droit sur le dossier SimCity et faites propriété et décocher lecture seul, il va vous demander si vous voulez l'appliquer aux dossiers et fichiers de ce dossiers faites oui, faites le également pour le dossier Origin Games qui se trouve dans C: Programmes ou Program Files, Origin Games. 
- Ensuite retourner dans le dossier SimCity et lancez le start.exe, logiquement sa devrait fonctionner, au cas ou, faire stop et relancer le start server.
- Dans le dossier SimCity, allez dans le dossier Extra et lancez l'installation de OriginSetup_9.1.15.109.exe
- Entrez dans origin et identifiez-vous avec l'ID : 3dmgame@3dmgame.com    .....      Mot de passe : 3dmgame
- Si tout va bien une page pour nom de SimCity DRMLESS server beta devrait apparaitre.
- Entrez dans boutique,Mes jeux pour voir simcity et faites télécharger en sélectionnant pour langue le français.
- Laissez le jeu se télécharger et jouer.
* Au cas si vous avez l'erreur Tampered, cliquez sur activate dans le start server et relancez le jeu !!! *"

,DizizG,2013-06-18T15:01Z,"""This worked for me!

TO SOLVE THE DUMMY CERTIFICATE ERROR:
1-First make sure your Simcity Folder is Not Read Only
2- Then Start start.exe Then Start Server and it will give you that Error
3-After it does DONT﻿ DO ANYTHING Don't Click Stop server and DON'T close start.exe
4-Go to﻿ Extra folder install Certificate then back to start.exe and click Check﻿ Components
Then it will say everything sounds﻿ good i really hope this helps!"" -Gerden

Worked for me also but when unchecking the read-only box for the sim city folder leave the properties window open!!!!!!! or windows 8 will restore it to read-only"
,Adnerian,2013-06-18T16:11Z,"Hey, guys. I am stucked at the non-valid licence Tampered(0x000A) error.

 I have read-only box unclicked (or so I think. I removed the tick on every file and gift all permision to all my computer users. But I can't clean the black square on folders).
And yes, I am using this windows 8  &%##&!!

 Please, can someone help this dummy user?"
,Adnerian,2013-06-18T16:21Z,"Ok, I am retarded. Just forgot to restart Origin and Server after unclicking read-only... -.-'

Works fine, for now. 
Ty much for the torrent, Mr.Stifmeister :D"

,linasbj,2013-06-18T18:43Z,"When I try to launch the game, it says ""We are unable to connect to EA servers to activate SimCity on this computer using your account. Please try again later"". Obviously, I have to activate the game, so I click the button in the Start.exe application, but there it says ""You need to run the game at least one time while the server is running to be able to activate it"". So I'm stuck in a rut. Any ideas? Everything else up to this point went pretty well."
,MISTAH1N1,2013-06-18T20:48Z,"Guys, what do you do about the Origin update? When I install Origin, it auto goes to updating it. Thats the problem no one mentioned here. When I disconnect my net, it gives error that net needs to be connected.

When I press activate server, I﻿ get error saying hostnames do not point at the private server"
,MISTAH1N1,2013-06-18T21:39Z,Ok solved my problem. The hosts file messed up somehow. I replaced it and everything works.

It's a pity we can't setup our own proper servers for this tho, now that would be great..."

,JocaDASA,2013-06-19T01:46Z,"Ok guys gonna answer some questions and add some things to the installation :
VERY IMPORTANT 1.!!!! 
1.When you copy the host file you must either restart you're computer or use Command Prompt :
ipconfig /flushdns
This is important because in order for the server to ""talk"" to origin the DNS must be changed
2.Some people asked is this gonna be multiplayer?
Well i think that there is a way..And that is to have one pirated server(that would ""imitate"" origin) that all other player would connect to.
3.Will this be able to play on Hamachi,Evolve etc.
That would present a problem...But tehnicly i think that there are 2 ways...One is to stay connected all the time in order for the save games to be preserved but that's not very good... :P ...The other way is when you connect, one server is the hosts and automatically sends sends data to everyone else,and when you end the ""multiplayer"" game the other cities will be the same until you connect again...But that way is very very unstable and can present many problems.
Hope this helped.. :)
You can send any problems with the game or questions to my mail joca.dasa@yahoo.com :)"
,LukeBongwater,2013-06-19T02:54Z,"Ok... I know how to get this working and all... I have since the first night it was released, but I deleted it because of many bugs in the 1.2 and 1.3 version. No cheats... Missing items..... invisible menus.... cant delete regions and etc... But I would like to know if these bugs are worked out now with this 1.5 version? I absolutly refuse to buy this game and support EA games! Seeing the stiff man release this makes me wanna believe this is not a bullshit version! Are the kinks worked out... can anyone verify????"
,ifhy,2013-06-19T03:48Z,"This torrent DOES work. Just follow the instructions clearly. 
Bugs: 

No cheats in sandbox.
Can't delete regions.
I don't know if it's just me but local regions don't seem to share anything, hard to say though.


It should take legit less than 10 minutes to set it up and get going.. Just start the server, (But don't close it) and you're good too go!"

,Tremmert,2013-06-19T04:16Z,"The game works fine, just follow the instructions LeXX (sorry if I mispelled your name here, didn't check back) provided, on page 3 or 4 I guess.

I've got 2 questions:
1 - Is it possible in any way to play this on a virtual server? Hamachi/Tunngle
2 - Is it me, or is there only 1 region to choose? I've got only 1 region, which fits 3 cities. Did I do something wrong on the install or it's just like that?

Thanks."

It's too bad there is no demo for this game, after reading the shitty reviews about EA and the DRM i've been contemplating if its even worth the time. Whats your opinion guys? buy it or trash it?"
