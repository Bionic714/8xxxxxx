The LabVIEW 2012 SP1 32-bit f2 patch is available at: 
http://ftp.ni.com/support/softlib/labview/labview_development_system/2012%20SP1/2012%20SP1%20f2%20Patch/LV2012SP1_f2Patch.exe


If the evaluation period is too short, this should not be a problem for too long after you complete the download ;)


Each of the three applications is in a 7zip compressed file, so you need an application similar to WinRar, PeaZip or 7Zip to decompress them and then use them.


It's getting uploaded using a slow line, so patience is needed :(
