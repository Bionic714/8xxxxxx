ok?"
,giggedyguy,2013-06-19T00:15Z,"Only if the HBO broadcast can't be found. Plus I'm willing to wait until next week when HBO does a replay of the broaddcast (I don't have TV). Maybe then someone will rip a nice copy. 

I'm shocked I haven't been able to find it. Sweetboxing changed their site so much since I last visited I can't find anything LOL Really appreciate what you can bring."
