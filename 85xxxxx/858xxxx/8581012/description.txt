Files are named via TheTVDB.com for my XBMC if you don't like it rename them.

My upload speed is slow so give it some time, be patient, and SEED!

Be sure to not limit your upload speed during initial seeding so I don't have to seed much more than 100% to get the torrent self sustaining. It would help me and you out a lot. What happens and how fast the torrent is after I finish seeding is YOUR responsibility.
