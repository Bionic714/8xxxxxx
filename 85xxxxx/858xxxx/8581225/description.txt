JetFighter 2: combat flight sim (DOS)
JetFighter II puts you at the cockpit of an F-23 Black Widow, F-14 Tomcat, F-16 Falcon or F-18 Hornet. Still the fastest flight simulator ever with 256 color VGA, advanced weaponry, and the best carrier landing simulation ever! This was so hot that PC Magazine called it "the best flight simulator on a desktop computer, period!" and industry guru John C. Dvorak raved, "this just might be the ultimate flight simulator!"

Spectre drops you into a brave new cyberworld featuring advanced simulation technology matched with superhot gameplay that will have you drenched in adrenaline! Go after the smart robots or take on your friends head to head over a network. Computer Gaming World said, "The action is pure and uncluttered... it's cyber-riffic!" and Strategy Plus raved... "The perfect computer game!"

Oh No! More Lemmings: 2D puzzle game (DOS, Win3.x)
