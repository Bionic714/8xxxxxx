Synopsis:
----------
Edwin Boyd: Citizen Gangster is based on the true story of a veteran of the Second World War and family man turned bank robber. Frustrated and disappointed by the circumstances of war, Edwin Boyd is a man torn between the need to support his young family and an unfulfilled dream to head to Hollywood to become a star. When he discovers a way to satisfy all your needs (rob banks "Hollywood style"), her dream for stardom leads him down an unexpected path of gangsterism, danger and tragedy.
A dramatic thriller format with excellent cinematography and a script apparently quite worked, despite the simplicity of the proposal. Without doubt, the greatest asset is its basis in fact, which brings realism to the plot.
