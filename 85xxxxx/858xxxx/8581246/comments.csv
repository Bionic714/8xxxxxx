,frobknob,2013-06-17T01:20Z,"Wow, as a long time reader of the Journal - thanks!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-17T02:17Z,"Hey! Y'all are most welcome. Glad there's an audience for these ""out there"". I'll keep filling in the holes and uploading whenever I have a reasonable amount (which could be a while)."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-17T02:56Z,"you continue to amaze me with the quality of your scans and with the depth and variety of your collection. you are, no offense, one magnificent bastard."
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-17T03:47Z,"STFmaryville, hey thanks. High praise coming from someone who does so much for the comic sharing community. No offense taken, I assure you.

I always want to keep everything out on the table and on the up and up, though, so let me do a bit of 'splainin'. 

I don't scan most of my uploads. I have scanned a small percentage of them, probably around five percent, and I will continue to do so in the future. The majority of my uploads come from places around the web (a lot of them) and/or software (a bunch of that, too) that is used to download already scanned books. Although this is going to sound the wrong way (I'm sure), I think my uploads appear the way they do because they represent what I'm out there looking for, as well as the fact that I know exactly what that is. I go to great lengths to research, check and re-check a huge list of what a certain type of artists and writers have done, what publishers have published, and what has or has not previously been uploaded around teh interwebs. 

So, anyway, this is probably much too long-winded (which is just kind of how I roll), but I wanted to make sure to not take credit for ALL of the scans. I appreciate all the hard work all the scanners have done in the past and are currently doing in every corner of comic book fandom around the world. 

That being said, I do spend an inordinate amount of time and energy putting together as many of the lesser known, weird, hard to find and more esoteric books I can locate. So thanks again for the kind words."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-17T06:55Z,"in a way, as this digital era progresses, a person like you is the new iteration of the comic collector who would go to a hundred shops to put together a near-mint run of a great series. like a collector with high standards, who didn't necessarily buy them when they were first printed, you put together the best sets available.

also, you explain yourself gooder than me do."
