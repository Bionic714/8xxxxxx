Kenny Barron - 2013 - Kenny Barron & The Brazilian Knights

Jazz pianist Kenny Barron celebrates the music of Brazil on his 2013 studio album, Kenny Barron & the Brazilian Knights. Here, Barron performs a variety of songs from the late Johnny Alf, as well as composer/harmonica player Mauricio Einhorn, who also joins Barron on the album. Also joining Barron are such luminaries as trumpeter Claudio Roditi, saxophonist Idriss Boudrioua, drummer Rafael Barata, guitarist Lula Galvao, bassist Sergio Barrozo, and keyboardist Alberto Chimelli. This is highly engaging Brazilian jazz. (AllMusic)
