Bob Dylan - Bootleg Series Vols.1-3 1961-1991 [CD-01] [only1joe] MP3-320 kbps

The Bootleg Series Volumes 1ΓÇô3 is a compilation box set by Bob Dylan, issued on Columbia Records, catalogue C3K 86572. It is the first installment in the Dylan bootleg series, comprising material spanning the first three decades of his career, from 1961 to 1989. It has been certified with a gold record by the RIAA as of August 1997, and peaked at #49 on the Billboard 200 and #32 in the UK
Of the 58 total tracks, 46 are session outtakes from the recording sessions for studio albums. The remaining dozen tracks are with one exception live recordings and demo records, three of latter being later duplicated on Volume 9 of the series.  Released in 1991 to satisfy enormous demand for Dylan's much-bootlegged unissued material, it contains rarities and unreleased works from the sessions for 1962's eponymous debut Bob Dylan to 1989's Oh Mercy. Unlike subsequent editions, which to date have all been double-disc packages, each volume in this set is a single compact disc, and the three volumes are not available separately..
