In January of 2010, while everyone was complaining about how difficult online poker had become, Pawel "Verneer" Nazarewicz wanted to prove to the poker world that, with the right approach, building a bankroll from scratch could still be done at the online tables. So starting at the micro stakes, he worked his way up the poker ladder turning $100 into $10,000 in 120 days. He accomplished the same feat a year later in 2011 in 100 days. In this book, Pawel shares the building blocks necessary for achieving long-term success at online poker. These teachings focus on seven fundamental concepts:
* Accept Variance
* Manage Your Bankroll
* Develop Reads
* Play Solid
* Stay on Your A-Game
* Put in the Hours
* Remain a Student
