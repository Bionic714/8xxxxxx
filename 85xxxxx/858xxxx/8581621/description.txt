OK, so, once upon a time, I restored and uploaded issues 1-4 of this series. Afterwards, somebody was kind enough to supply me with issues five, so I headed on over to the SuprBay to ask the mods to remove the original upload, intending to re-up it with all five issues. However, after they'd removed it I decided I wasn't particularly happy with the restoration on those books (they have an original look that was hard to make adjustments on), so I put it to the side, waiting (hoping) I'd come across a better batch of scans, or eventually I'd scan it myself. Thankfully, I found some MUCH better scans, so here they are.

I'm still hunting for issues 6-8 (actually titled Overbite, Underbelly and Bent), but they were formatted completely different (not comic size hard back books) and don't seem to be readily available
