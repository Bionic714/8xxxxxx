,uneedabiscuit,2013-06-17T20:45Z,I can't download these files.. no one will seed.. I even try to download one episode at a time.. I REALLY want to watch these.. This is frustrating
,djpaulywood,2013-06-18T00:07Z,Sorry they won't seed - but I will keep it uploaded for a long time for ya!

,olddroid,2013-06-18T21:40Z,I doubt we will see these torrents 100 % done...
