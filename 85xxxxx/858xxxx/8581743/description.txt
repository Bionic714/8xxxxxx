Natasha is a famous european comic book series by Francois Walthery, about the air hostess Natasha, and her adventures.

Here is the first book, from Alice. She MIGHT do more, she is not sure, depend on how this is received, so if you like this, PLEASE comment, so I can talk her into doing more :).


Natasha and Walter are crew members on a charter flight for a soccer team destined for South America. The flight is also carrying a secret cargo of two crates of gold. A team of thugs impersonates the soccer players and makes it look like the plane crashed to divert the plane and take possession of the cargo.

After a missed landing in the Amazon rainforest, Natasha is separated from the rest of the group and falls into the hands of Indian guyapos, the dreaded head-hunters.
