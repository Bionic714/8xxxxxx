You are a gun for hire, trapped in a war-torn African state, stricken with

malaria and forced to make deals with corrupt warlords on both sides of

the conflict in order to make this country your home.

You must identify and exploit your enemies' weaknesses, neutralizing their

superior numbers and firepower with surprise, subversion, cunning and of

course brute force.
