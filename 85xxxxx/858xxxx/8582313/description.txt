Grab your friends and family for a game of Chompy Chomp Chomp. Compete with up to four players in a local multiplayer battle and play solo or with a friend in a co-operative arcade challenge.

Check out the brand new single player / co-op arcade mode. Blobbidees have infested our garden. Ugh! TheyΓÇÖre gross! Help us out by chomping as many as you can. Switch your target colour around and watch out for the Queen Blobbidee! Beat the high scores and tally up your blobbidee count. Share a keyboard or grab a couple of controllers and play with a friend to see if you can get even further!

The battle mode of Chompy Chomp Chomp is a maze-based free-for-all where you chase each other around trying to eat the correctly coloured opponent. Under your feet is the target colour of the chompy that you need to eat. Throughout the round the target changes colour, turning the hunted into the hunter and vice versa. Chomp your way through rich and varied arena environments and battle each other using frenzied power-ups. Play with up to four players and scream out loud!
