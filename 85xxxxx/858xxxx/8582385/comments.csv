,xgoxdiexxx,2013-06-17T07:58Z,thanks.  wife will love this one.
,OGDragzz,2013-06-17T10:44Z,"Hope the quality is as good as it looks, thanks man!"
,FreeGameFreak77,2013-06-17T11:48Z,DL cuz my boy scene4all UL it....nuff said..
,bartaz,2013-06-17T11:59Z,is it better than previous TS versions?
,KevinCostner,2013-06-17T12:11Z,It is the best copy available so far.  Vidro looks nice however there are several audio issues.  Sound is very distorted and compressed.  There will be gun fire and explosions happening in the movie which you don't hear.  Hopefully someone with the skills can take this copy and clean it up.  V-8 A-6
[V],simon200,2013-06-17T12:25Z,"Cheers dude
A 8
V 7 for a cam
it's the best out by far, a bit too dark in the night time scenes but definitely watchable for cam watchers  "
,kingbmw,2013-06-17T12:57Z,thanks for this 
,SomeBoyFromVillage,2013-06-17T13:12Z,thnx!
,bartaz,2013-06-17T13:49Z,"finally good quailty, thx scene4all"
,everx7,2013-06-17T16:08Z,"yep great copy, A6 V8, i mean the audios clear but if theres something like explosion, gunshot or something similar what makes a big bang or boom or whatever is very distorted, but other then its ok, mean talking, engine sound and everything except what i just wrote, video is absolutely great for TS or CAM ye agree wheres dark its quite very dark, but u can adjust brightness and gamma in VLC so no problem for me, recommend this if u dont want to wait for a dvdrip or brip :)"
,Bazinga,2013-06-17T16:25Z,Man Of Steel? D:
,Sharpy408,2013-06-17T23:08Z,Quality still sucks cack. 
,swine666,2013-06-18T00:11Z,"I cant believe there are pirates wasting available time and resources and risking trouble with the law for such abominable franchises. Why dont they get busy trying to offer something much better like ""now you see me'? Id rather be seen taking a dump in a public place than walking into a theater that is showing any fast and furious film, it would be less embarassing!"
,ragesugar,2013-06-18T06:34Z,Nice! Very watchable
,dsoumelr,2013-06-18T07:42Z,thnx fr the upload

,notgaym82,2013-06-18T12:33Z,last screen SPOILER!!!!!
,repsolfireblade05,2013-06-18T16:29Z,"@swine666  only one word i can think of for you ,,fucktard.."
,swine666,2013-06-18T18:16Z,@repsolfireblade05 the only fucktard here is you. Even your name tells me you like japanese inline 4cylinder motorcycles which like the fast and furious films are also abominations. If you had some decent taste youd be riding a ducatti or any other v-twin racing bike like anybody with some decent taste does.
,azoze11,2013-06-18T20:25Z,"thank you
