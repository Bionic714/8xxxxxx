Review
ΓÇ£The timing of Robert WhitakerΓÇÖs ΓÇ£Anatomy of an Epidemic,ΓÇ¥ a comprehensive and highly readable history of psychiatry in the United States, couldnΓÇÖt be better.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöSalon.com

ΓÇ£Anatomy of an Epidemic offers some answers, charting controversial ground with mystery-novel pacing.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöTIME.com

ΓÇ£Lucid, pointed and important, Anatomy of an Epidemic should be required reading for anyone considering extended use of psychiatric medicine. Whitaker is at the height of his powers.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöGreg Critser, author of Generation Rx

ΓÇ£Why are so many more people disabled by mental illness than ever before?  Why are those so diagnosed dying 10-25 years earlier than others?  In Anatomy of an Epidemic investigative reporter Robert Whitaker cuts through flawed science, greed and outright lies to reveal that the drugs hailed as the cure for mental disorders instead worsen them over the long term.  But WhitakerΓÇÖs investigation also offers hope for the future: solid science backs natureΓÇÖs way of healing our mental ills through time and human relationships.  Whitaker tenderly interviews children and adults who bear witness to the ravages of mental illness, and testify to their newly found ΓÇ£alivenessΓÇ¥ when freed from the prison of mind-numbing drugs.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöDaniel Dorman, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, UCLA School of Medicine and author of DanteΓÇÖs Cure: A Journey Out of Madness
 
ΓÇ£This is the most alarming book IΓÇÖve read in years.  The approach is neither polemical nor ideologically slanted. Relying on medical evidence and historical documentation, Whitaker builds his case like a prosecuting attorney.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöCarl Elliott, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Center for Bioethics, University of Minnesota and author of Better than Well: American Medicine Meets the American Dream
 
ΓÇ£Anatomy of an Epidemic investigates a profoundly troubling question: do psychiatric medications increase the likelihood that people taking them, far from being helped, are more likely to become chronically ill? In making a compelling case that our current psychotropic drugs are causing as muchΓÇöif not moreΓÇöharm than good, Robert Whitaker reviews the scientific literature thoroughly, demonstrating how much of the evidence is on his side. There is nothing unorthodox hereΓÇöthis case is solid and evidence-backed. If psychiatry wants to retain its credibility with the public, it will now have to engage with the scientific argument at the core of this cogently and elegantly written book.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöDavid Healy, M.D., Professor of Psychiatry, Cardiff University and author of The Antidepressant Era and Let Them Eat Prozac
 

ΓÇ£Every so often a book comes along that exposes a vast deceit. Robert Whitaker has written that sort of book. Drawing on a prodigious quantity of psychiatric literature as well as heart-rending stories of individual patients, he exposes a deeply disturbing fraud perpetrated by the drug industry and much of modern psychiatryΓÇöat horrendous human and financial cost to patients, their families, and society as a whole. Scrupulously reported and written in compelling but unemotional style, this book shreds the myth woven around todayΓÇÖs psychiatric drugs.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇöNils Bruzelius, former science editor for the Boston Globe and the Washington Post
 
ΓÇ£A devastating critique. . . . One day, we will look back at the way we think about and treat mental illness and wonder if we were all mad. Anatomy of an Epidemic should be required reading for both patients and physicians.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇöShannon Brownlee, senior research fellow, New America Foundation and author of Overtreated
