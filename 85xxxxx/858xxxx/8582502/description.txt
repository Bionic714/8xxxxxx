Show description from theweb site :: On today's LIVE Sunday, June 16 worldwide broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down how modern slavery is being re-instituted by passing laws that criminalize normal behavior ΓÇô like wearing an NRA t-shirt or owning a pipe. Alex also lays siege to the NSA's Orwellian Panopticon surveillance grid as new revelations surface from a secret Congressional briefing. Alex continues with unrelenting force to lay out the scandals obliterating Obama's second term with, as the surveillance and police states pull out all the stops to suppress opposition. We'll also look at the ramp up to an invasion of Syria by arming and funding Al Qaeda affiliated rebel forces there, and the Turkish protests going into their third week as the world hurdles towards more and more intensified tyranny.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
