Review

This new edition is helpful to the average reader because it situates Lawrence within the historical context of his times. But its greatest benefit for such readers is that it provides them with a fresh, readable translation of a classic of Christian literature. --Wendy M. Wright, Weavings

This faithfully translated new edition is the most complete and comprehensive text on Brother Lawrence available. --Gerald E. May, M.D., from the Foreword
