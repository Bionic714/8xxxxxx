          1 Extract archives, burn or mount the .iso

          2 Run Setup (make sure you have dot.net, direct-x, and the usual crap
             installed also)

          3 Click on the neat new icon that is placed on your desktop

          4 Play and have a fun!      (like = buy!)

          The new update of Eleusis is finally here. Unlike in previous updates,
          version 1.2 introduces all-new gameplay elements to enhance the overall
          gaming experience. Venturing through the forest is now most unsettling due
          to new hazards. The player acquires the ability to throw items to defend
          himself. He can use stealth tactics and agility to survive.

          So many new stuff/gameplay changes (plus bugfixxes). An update wouldnt do
          the trick. so here is a FULL release of version 1.2 of this awesome indie
          horror title!
