First, Thank you for everything you do for the community! Youre awesome! I am looking for Ms. Marvel Vol. 2 Issues #48-50. I've searched high and low and cant come up with anything but the Espanol versions! If you have them, please upload them at your earliest convenience! Either way, you are awesome and thanks!"

i'm 99% sure that over on h33t dot com you can find a marvel chronology torrent with those missing issues. if you have the cover dates it makes it easier. sorry, i know it's not much help."
