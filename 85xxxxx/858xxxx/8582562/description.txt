Meanwhile, an out-of-work Hawkeye takes a security job and clashes with the vicious alien princess Deathbird!

Plus: The Avengers are called before Congress, battle the stone-faced Grey Gargoyle, face the new Inferno and deal with the meddling machinations of government liaison Henry Peter Gyrich! But when the team investigates a cry for help from a mental hospital, they discover a deadly new foe: Who is the terrible Taskmaster? And how can the Avengers hope to stop him when he can match every single fighting move they have to offer? Time to get creative!
