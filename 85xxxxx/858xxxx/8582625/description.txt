Beachbody's P90X Ultimate and P90X2 Ultimate x264 MP4 DVDrip

I have now combined all P90X and P90X2 workouts in one complete package all in High Quality x264 in MP4 container for maximum compatibility. I didn't care for the quality of the other x264 P90X torrents so I created one that was very good quality with low space requirements. This package includes P90X, P90X+ and P90X2.

P90X

P90X2
Train off-balance to build the body of an athlete.
P90X revolutionized fitness. Now, P90X2 will change the way you work outΓÇªforever. P90X2 delivers the kind of results pro athletes insist on. Not by making you work harderΓÇªbut by helping you work smarter. With a breakthrough in applied sports science called Muscle Integration. YouΓÇÖll engage all of your muscles with every move, delivering the same kind of training pro-athletes pay thousands of dollars for.
So whatΓÇÖs the key? Instability. Instead of working one muscle group at a time, with P90X2, youΓÇÖll do resistance moves on one foot, a ball, or some other unstable platform. Because your body is forced to maintain stability as you lift, more muscles are engaged with each movement. YouΓÇÖll fire your abs, glutes, hamstrings ΓÇô and an entire chain of muscles you may not even know how to pronounce. This is how you work your entire body in one move. As one unit. This is how you become an efficient, calorie-burning, ripping machine.
