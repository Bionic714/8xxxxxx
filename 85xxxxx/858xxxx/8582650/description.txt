Photographic imagery has come a long way from the pinhole cameras of the
nineteenth century. Digital imagery, and its applications, develops in tandem
with contemporary society's sophisticated literacy of this subtle medium. This
book examines the ways in which digital images have become ever more ubiquitous
as legal and medical evidence, just as they have become our primary source of
news and have replaced paper-based financial documentation.
Crucially, the contributions also analyze the very profound problems which have
arisen alongside the digital image, issues of veracity and progeny that demand
systematic and detailed response: It looks real, but is it? What camera
captured it? Has it been doctored or subtly altered? Attempting to provide
answers to these slippery issues, the book covers how digital images are
created, processed and stored before moving on to set out the latest techniques
for forensically examining images, and finally addressing practical issues
such as courtroom admissibility. In an environment where even novice users can
alter digital media, this authoritative publication will do much so stabilize
public trust in these real, yet vastly flexible, images of the world around us.
