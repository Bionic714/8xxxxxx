Description

Prove your code is working every step of the way using a formalized test-driven development (TDD) process. TDD can be done in every modern programming environment, and for desktop, mobile, or web apps. In this course, Simon Allardice teaches you exactly how to get started with TDD: what makes a good test, why we're more interested in failure than success, and how to measure and repeatedly run tests.

The course explores the jargon of TDDΓÇötest suites, test harness, mock and stub objects, and moreΓÇöand covers how TDD is used in the most common programming languages and environments. Plus learn to create, run, and manage the tests and move to a test-first mindset.
Topics include:

* What is test-driven development?
* Using unit testing frameworks
* Creating tests
* Using assertions
* Creating multiple test methods
* Naming unit tests and test methods
* Testing return values
* Setting up and tearing down
* Introducing mock objects
* Measuring code coverage
