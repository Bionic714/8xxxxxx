Thanks for upload again. 

Btw, your Awakening upload seems to be incomplete. It only goes up to #3. "

No problem, and I just noticed that today when another site uploaded it. The website where I get alot of my comics from only listed that there were 3 comics, and another site that I also go to to check for information about comics and how many issues they have also listed the comic with only 3 issues. 

I assure you though most of what I upload are complete series! Also I try not to upload just one specific genre either!"
,Calel1234,2013-06-17T18:24Z,"Yeah. I've downloaded a lot from you recently and they're all complete.  :)

But can you reupload Awakening? At least the last two issues."
,Calel1234,2013-06-17T22:31Z,"Nevermind, found it.  :)"
,RobbieDee,2013-06-18T01:08Z,"@Cale1234

I plan on uploading the entire series, but a little more reasearch will be done on it just to make sure everything's there!"
