Description:

SOMETIMES ALL YOU CAN DO IS GO OUT WITH GUNS BLAZING...

In the noir tradition of Chandler and Spillane comes SUNSET, a two-fisted tale of revenge and redemption. On the surface, Nick Bellamy looks like any other veteran retiree left behind by a modern world. In reality, Nick is a former enforcer, who stole a fortune and years of freedom from his former mob boss. Now, in the twilight of his life, Nick will lose everything he cares about except two things: revenge... and the chance to die with his guns blazing.
