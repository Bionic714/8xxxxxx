Already enjoying a rebirth in its homeland, Colombian cumbia is receiving a further make-over in Buenos Aires, where its skittering rhythms and wheezing accordion come mixed with electronica. The flamboyant La Yegros has emerged as queen of the scene, helped by the writing and production of her husband, Gaby Kerpel (aka King Coya). Her vocal style can be piercing – the title track, a huge hit across South America, is a case in point – but she's agile and raps with bravado on Iluminada. The backings mutate inventively, dropping into reggae on Vagar and entering warp space on El Bendito. A blast.
