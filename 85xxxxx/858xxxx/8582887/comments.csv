PLEASE re-seed The Terrible Pope, it is a comic uploaded by you. I particularly enjoyed Borgia and this is by the same author. Thank you"

Looking forward to more batman comics from your side :)"

,soletar,2013-06-17T23:34Z,"Black canary... i noticed! thanks for the prompt response!. i really appreciate it. Still hasnt finished but am waiting. It humbles me when Green Skulls like you still care about US. I noticed people like you, Downtown, stfmaryville , mirrormaster etc still take your time to reply. THANKS for everything"
