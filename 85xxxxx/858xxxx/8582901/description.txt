Directed by Otto Preminger, it stars a whole lot of famous actors.
Jackie Gleason and Carol Channing are married, and he doesn't want to work any longer for "God" (played by Groucho Marx), the very high-up mafia-esque guy who lives on a boat, at sea, and makes his orders known to everybody. 

So god wants a certain guy (Mickey Rooney,) who is in prison, to be dead...and he makes Jackie Gleason (Tony Banks) go into prison on trumped-up charges to do the deed.

While in prison, he (Gleason) accidentally ingests LSD. Hilarity ensues. Later, they turn everyone in prison on to LSD. Finally, after Carol Channing and lots of hippies get onto the former-secret yacht and find Groucho Marx, it ends with Groucho smoking a joint in a smaller boat, and everyone is OK. 

Other actors in it include: Frankie Avalon, Frank Gorshin, Peter Lawford, Burgess Meredith, George Raft, Cesar Romero...wow, that's a lot of famous actors.

And...it is in color.
