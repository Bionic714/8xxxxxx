when available.

*MULTIMEDIA: Send Video, Images, and Voice notes to
your friends and contacts.

*GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group conversations with your
contacts.
*NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: Just like there is no
added cost to send an international email, there is no cost to
send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your
friends all over the world as long as they have WhatsApp
Messenger installed and avoid those pesky international SMS
costs.

*SAY NO TO PINS AND USERNAMES: Why even bother
having to remember yet another PIN or username? WhatsApp
works with your phone number, just like SMS would, and
integrates flawlessly with your existing phone address book.

getting logged off from another computer or device. With
push notifications WhatsApp is ALWAYS ON and ALWAYS
CONNECTED.

to automatically connect you with your contacts. Your
contacts who already have WhatsApp Messenger will be
automatically displayed.

notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your
messages offline until you retrieve them during the next
application use.

*AND MUCH MORE: Share location, Exchange contacts,
