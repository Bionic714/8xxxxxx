In "Millions Like Us" Virginia Nicholson tells the story of the women's Second World War, through a host of individual women's experiences. We tend to see the Second World War as a man's war, featuring Spitfire crews and brave deeds on the Normandy beaches. But in conditions of "Total War" millions of women - in the Services and on the Home Front - demonstrated that they were cleverer, more broad-minded and altogether more complex than anyone had ever guessed. "Millions Like Us" tells the story of how these women loved, suffered, laughed, grieved and dared; how they re-made their world in peacetime. And how they would never be the same again..."Vividly entertaining, uplifting and humbling, "Millions Like Us" deserves to be a bestseller". (Bel Mooney, "The Daily Mail"). "Passionate, fascinating, profoundly sympathetic". (Artemis Cooper, "Evening Standard"). Virginia Nicholson was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and grew up in Yorkshire and Sussex. She studied at Cambridge University and lived abroad in France and Italy, then worked as a documentary researcher for BBC Television. Her books include the acclaimed social history "Among the Bohemians - Experiments in Living 1900-1939", and "Singled Out - How Two Million Women Survived Without Men after the First World War", both published by Penguin in 2002 and 2007. She is married to a writer, has three children and lives in Sussex.
