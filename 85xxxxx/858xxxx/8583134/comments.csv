i have a question murphy, what would be the difference between the different installation indexes?"
[V],murphy78,2013-06-17T20:56Z,"1) non-activated (for people who want to use other activation methods)
2) activated with winloader default settings
3) branding + winloader if not activated with branding. See the mdl project for info on that."
,leadspectre,2013-06-18T05:43Z,Hey murphy do I really need that OEM-Activated Installation Index with that branding and what not? I mean are you going to released this package without that? I just feel like its just makes the thing bigger than it needs to be no? sorry to trouble you I'm a newb & thanks for everything!
[V],murphy78,2013-06-18T11:08Z,"No. If anything I'll drop the Net45 stuff to save room for it; should the disc approach the limit of dvdr single layer size 4.37gib.

I have had more requests for the branding than you can imagine. Yes it does increase the size something like 150megs."
,leadspectre,2013-06-18T21:14Z,"I have an old Dell Dimension 8400 should I do OEM-Install or just dazloader pre-activated?
again I'm not an expert so I apologize for asking so many questions thanks for your help!"
,neto960,2013-06-18T22:01Z,"Oh, ok ok, but, what installation index do you consider better when talking about getting windows activated forever without problems?"
