Been using your previous versions of Windows 8 and 7 which has been more easy to setup then other versions."

[V],murphy78,2013-06-18T11:07Z,"salam, that update is the wat update, and should not run all the time. If you are having a problem with it installed, just uninstall it through the control panel."
,TWEETY2455,2013-06-18T15:35Z,I fuck hope this worthy 22 hours and still only 75%ready.
,joeuser,2013-06-18T16:52Z,"@murphy78,

Your releases are the best. I am skipping this release as I don't care much about windows 7 ultimate (don't need the bitlocker and extra languages support junk). I will be looking out for something that contains Windows 7 professional (probably the AIO release). 
Moving Net45 Installation outside is the biggest plus. 
Please let me know if you intend to incorporate a Windows 7 + MS Office installation into 1 in the near future. 

Thanks,
Joe"
