Rachel and Ben. Ben and Rachel. It was them against the

years melt away.

TheyΓÇÖd been partners in crime and the best of friends. But

split second, Rachel feels the old friendship return. And
along with it, the broken heart sheΓÇÖs never been able to
mend.

Hilarious, heartbreaking and everything in between, youΓÇÖll be
hooked from their first ΓÇÿhelloΓÇÖ.

Mhairi was born in Scotland in 1976 and has been explaining
how to pronounce her name ever since. (With a ΓÇÿVΓÇÖ, not an
ΓÇÿMΓÇÖ. Yes, thatΓÇÖs us crazy Celts for you).
She is based in Nottingham where she used to be a local
journalist and now sheΓÇÖs a freelance writer and sometime-
blogger, which we all know is code for messing about on
Twitter.
