Oslo Skishow is an annual roller ski race for national and international ski stars with start and finish at Aker Brygge. It is arranged by the Norwegian Cross-Country national team in cooperation with its main sponsor Aker and the clubs in Oslo ski district.

The athletes decided that all profits from Oslo Skishow should go the foundation Aktiv mot kreft/ Active against cancer and their projects for children suffering from cancer. Profits from last year's race were given to St. Olavs hospital in Trondheim.
