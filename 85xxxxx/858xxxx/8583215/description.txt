NOTES     
       
 We have a very watchable German source from PsO. I've put in a few
 special filters on the video to dynamically brighten it where
 needed. Colors have also been slightly adjusted and hue has been
 shifted a bit to the blue end. A sharpen filter was also used as
 well as an unsharp mask to bring out some of the edges. As for the
 audio, its the same one as the KingStoner and DiRTYMARY release,
 which means it has high end distortion. There really isn't 
 much that can be done about it but I tried my best to make the 
 audio a bit clearer. The video is also the same source as DiRTYMARY 
 but I've not hardcoded any subs into the video. Realistically you 
 don't lose any of the story for the Spanish parts. Finally I will say 
 this - for the first few minutes of the movie, the audio distortion
 is at its highest, so it only gets better from there. The audio 
 goes a tad out of sync here and there but it comes back into place. 
 I'm not the best at it so I did what I could but its there. Also the 
 camera at the start moves a few bits but settles in and from there 
 only a few minor movements and blurs. So overall I'd say its pretty 
 watchable for what we have to work with. And yes, the post scene is 
 included.
