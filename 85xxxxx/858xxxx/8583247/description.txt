Hey there, thanks for you interest.
It's Wyv and Keep: The Temple of the Lost Idol!
A co-op 2D puzzle platformer best played with a partner.

You'll need the .NET framework 4.0, XNA 4.0, and Windows Media Player.
Google should help you find all these, but feel free to ask us for help.

We decided uploading our own game to TPB was the right thing to do,
so please download & seed away - we're totally cool with you pirating our game!


There's screenshots and trailers and stuff right over here:

If you share this with your friends,
and vote for us on Steam Greenlight,
then you can consider your copy of Wyv and Keep paid for in our eyes :)
