The setting for "The Shadow Box" is three cottages on the grounds of a large hospital. Here, three tales unfold. Each tale features a person who is dying. Each person is surrounded by loved ones. All are trying to face and make sense of death.
 
The first family we meet is the most conventional. Joe (James Broderick), a working class husband and father, is joined at the cottage by his wife Maggie (Valerie Harper), who, in denial of JoeΓÇÖs impending death is afraid to enter the cottage. Their son, Steve, age 14, has not yet been told of his fatherΓÇÖs terminal condition. The second family consists of Brian (Christopher Plummer), who is brutally forthright about his demise, Mark (Ben Masters), his doting lover and Beverly (Joanne Woodward), BrianΓÇÖs free-spirited ex-wife who comes to visit them. The third family is a feisty, wheelchair-bound mother, Felicity (Sylvia Sydney), and her dutiful daughter, Agnes (Melinda Dillon).
 
Based on The Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning play by Michael Cristofer, this 1980 Tv Movie adaptation was directed by Paul Newman and was the winner of the Golden Globe Award for "Best Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV" that year as well as several Emmy nominations.
