Description:
George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series has
become, in many ways, the gold standard for modern epic
fantasy. Martin--dubbed the "American Tolkien" by Time
magazine--has created a world that is as rich and vital as
any piece of historical fiction, set in an age of knights and
chivalry and filled with a plethora of fascinating,
multidimensional characters that you love, hate to love, or
love to hate as they struggle for control of a divided kingdom.
It is this very vitality that has led it to be adapted as the HBO
miniseries "Game of Thrones."

This set includes the following novels:
A Game of Thrones
A Clash of Kings
A Storm of Swords
A Feast for Crows
A Dance with Dragons
