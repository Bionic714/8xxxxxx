Checkbook For Excel v6.0b with Key - [MUMBAI]


Version 6 is a major upgrade of Checkbook for Excel and provides a plethora of new features and enhancements, many of which were suggested by our loyal users. It includes full support for Excel 2007 through 2013 and beyond. We believe the Office Ribbon user interface available in Excel 2007, 2010 and 2013 provides a richer end user experience, especially for our custom Excel applications. If you are still using Excel 97-2003 versions, you can still download Version 5, which is fully compatible with those versions of Excel.

Checkbook for Excel retains the same intuitive yet powerful interface from the earlier versions and provides all the necessary features for managing your financial accounts and accounting ledgers without all the excess baggage and gratuitous advertising associated with the popular personal finance packages. This makes it faster and easier to use.  Checkbook for Excel provides exactly what you need; a simple, powerful, easy way to track, maintain and balance your bank accounts, credit cards and other business and personal expenses.

Version 6.0b provided the following enhancements and fixes to version 6.0a.
-Fixed a problem with addresses not printing on checks.
-Fixed a problem with the zip code not transferring from the recurring 
 transactions list to the ledger when entering transactions.
-Fixed a problem with some QIF files not importing.
