It says 15 days trial after install and copying over the dll from crack folder on Win7 x64.
So... Is it a working crack or it will end up after 15 days?"
,gyurci73,2013-06-17T18:04Z,"Ok. I tried it.
I changed the date of my computer some days forward and run the app. It says 2 days left from my trial period... Then I changed back the date to current and run again. It says my trial period is over!!!!!

So the crack doesn't work!"

-Install Wondershare MobileGo for Android
-After installation it will show 15 days trial
-click on exit an select direct exit (do not minimize)
-simply copy paste the file from crack folder to C:Program Files (x86)WondershareMobileGo for Android and done.
-just confirm with step 3."

I didn't run the app after installation.
After installation I copied/pasted and overwrited the required file in the corresponding directory.
Then I run the app and got the trial thing."
