ThereΓÇÖs nothing quite like a hot, soothing bowl of soup. ItΓÇÖs a leisurely mealΓÇöa purposeful one that offers pause for reflection between every savory spoonful. What if you approached every meal as if it were that delicious bowl of soup?

In Reinventing the Meal, youΓÇÖll learn how to reconnect with your body, mind, and world with a three-course approach to mindful eating. Inside, youΓÇÖll find mindfulness exercises to help you slow down and enjoy your food, pattern-interruption meditations to infuse presence into your eating life, and unique stress management tips to prevent emotional overeating. In addition, youΓÇÖll discover a wealth of philosophical perspectives that will inspire you to focus on the quality of your eating experience, rather than on the quantity of what you eat. Designed to help you embrace the ritual of eating (and discover the power of mindful meditation in the process), this book will ultimately change the way you view your mealsΓÇöas not only sustenance for the body, but for the soul as well.
