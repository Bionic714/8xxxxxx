Description: Is there a doctor in da house?! Introducing Doctor P, the sonic surgeon known across the globe for dissecting Dubstep and pumping it full of his own unique formula! This skull-cracking instalment in the Prime Loops Artist Series comes to you in collaboration with Circus Records and explores this doctor's mad Frankenstein sound - a freakishly dope fusion of Dubstep, Complextro and Drumstep!
Making a name for himself under several aliases (including Sounds Destructive, Slum Dogz and DJ Picto), Doctor P has emitted several frenzy-inducing frequencies in the form of the bass-heavy, synth screeching releases' Superbad ',' Sweetshop 'and' Tetris' as well as celebrated productions for some major playas including Example, Plan B and Eva Simons! Also, keep you ears peeled for Doctor P's forthcoming monster track "The Pit" - featuring no one less than Method Man!
