 and even if he plays the key role          
 of Raavan in the popular stage play        
 ΓÇÿRaavan LeelaΓÇÖ, his values echo those      
 of Ram. He is always ready to help         
 people in need, often at the cost of       
 his own comfort. One night as RP is        
 on his way to meet his long term           
 girlfriend Chitra, he comes across         
 Mandar Lele, who is distraught and         
 lonely.
