Review
"Ashall is a fresh voice in popular science writing. In a book directed at those with little knowledge of the scientific world and its major figures, he covers 18 topics, most in life sciences...Ashall is an able expository writer who doesn't spare the reader the language of experiments, giving this anthology an air of immediacy and authenticity."
