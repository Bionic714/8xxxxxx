Marc Hauser, "Moral Minds: The Nature of Right and Wrong"
ISBN: 006078072X | 2007 | EPUB

In his groundbreaking book, Marc Hauser puts forth a revolutionary new theory: that humans have evolved a universal moral instinct, unconsciously propelling us to deliver judgments of right and wrong independent of gender, education, and religion. Combining his cutting-edge research with the latest findings in cognitive psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, economics, and anthropology, Hauser explores the startling implications of his provocative theory vis-a-vis contemporary bioethics, religion, the law, and our everyday lives.
