description:

The life, ideas, and selected writings of one of the greatest mystical philosophers of all time. St. Bonaventure (1221-1274) is known as the Seraphic Doctor in honor of one of the basic qualities of his teaching--the purest love. He left us with a treasury of class writings of philosophical mysticism that explored the ascent of our minds and souls to God.
