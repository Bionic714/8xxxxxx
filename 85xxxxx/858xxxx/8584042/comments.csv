,fallenraven86,2013-06-17T21:10Z,Needs a rooted device to we can install modified google play store (by celphus) that prevents license verification of final fantasy IV.
,coleix,2013-06-17T22:33Z,"oh okay, so it needs the cracked store."
,romeo2539,2013-06-18T04:57Z,"can tyou just get a firewall and block it from accessing your 4g, 3g, or wifi??"
,fallenraven86,2013-06-18T15:45Z,The game wont run without verification. The modified play store removes the verification process. Sucks i know.
