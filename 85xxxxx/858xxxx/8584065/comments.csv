[H],shirepirate,2013-06-17T20:57Z,"why did I choose to upload this album with all the existing torrents? good question. First of all, I make a concerted effort to tag things perfectly. Second, I don't do shit transcodes or inferior quality. i don't lie to downloaders either.

here's a spectrogram of track 8 of this torrent, keep it open for reference:

at this time,
the top seeded torrent of this album is 192kbps mp3... that needs no explanation
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8470565/

the next top seeded is fake upconverted 320kbps mp3, transcoded itunes
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8503613/
here is proof of that:

the next top seeded is also fake upconverted 320kbps mp3, from who knows where
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8480718/
and here is proof of that:

getting the picture yet?

here's the next top seeded, yet ANOTHER fake upconverted 320kbps mp3
https://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8471487/
and here is proof of that:

I don't think I need to go on. check your downloads with Audacity spectrogram before you believe you have found real 320kbps mp3, or simply download from me or another uploader who checks their shit.

enjoy the album :)"
