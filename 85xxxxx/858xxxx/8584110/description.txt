Bonaventure (George Boas, translator) - The Mind's Road to God (first published by Macmillan, 1953).

This translation of Bonaventure's great work has apparently fallen into the public domain and is widely available on the internet. For this version I've made various improvements to the plain text version:

--Corrected errors, including restoring several missing footnotes
--Changed the spelling of the author's name from Bonaventura to the now-standard Bonaventure
--Restored all missing italics
--Formatted the text so that it matches the print edition as closely as possible
--Formatted footnotes with standard hyperlinks
--Added a cover image

The Mind's Road to God is available in another translation (as "The Soul's Journey into God") in one of my previous uploads.

The book, in Latin called Itinerarium Mentis in Deum, is one of the great mystical works of the middle ages, but some background is needed to understand it.
