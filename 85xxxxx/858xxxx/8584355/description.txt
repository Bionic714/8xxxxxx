Body weight training exercises may be trained progressively by adjusting leverage, range of motion, and positioning. With these in mind, body mechanics, and movement, one may use progressive calisthenics to achieve very high levels of functional, full body strength and coordination. This is primarily because calisthenics use natural movements that act on multiple joints, and force many stabilizer muscles to be used. Lastly, calisthenics help to improve posture, as well as build supple strength and tension in the tendons, ligaments, and joints. If you would like to learn more, please visit -
