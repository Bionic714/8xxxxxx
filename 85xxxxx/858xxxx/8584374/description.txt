Do you like running?  How about gunning?  What if special abilities are
thrown into the mix?  Upgradable weapons?  Lets say therere dozens of
on-screen enemies to unleash this firepower on, and as your reward for
dispatching them you get experience and gold to collect that can be used for
character customization and new equipment--all the while playing alongside
friends in 4-player cooperative play!  If you like the sound of all this,
then youll love God Mode.

Retro shooter action and RPG elements are combined in this new downloadable
third-person shooter. God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic
shooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, a fully functional online coop mode,
and features visuals and gameplay that rival that of a full-priced boxed
title. Matches rarely--if ever--play out the same, as dozens of in-game
modifiers can significantly alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are
fully customizable, both in appearance and equipment, which continually
evolve. Gold and experience are constantly accrued and used to unlock new and
satisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of which can be
further upgraded.
