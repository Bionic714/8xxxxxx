,JarjarTwink,2013-06-18T01:48Z,No sample ? =(
,Veganisman,2013-06-18T04:59Z,Is the movie full? because on the information is 2h 12mn! And the full movie has 2h 28!
,Ugleh,2013-06-18T05:44Z,"For about the first 10 minutes there is a noticeable black annoyance at the top left, it goes away.

It is watchable, very hard though at the dark scenes to understand small details.

I have never rated quality so I did not feel fit to. The audio is audible. Never missed a word."
,mrknowitawl,2013-06-18T05:47Z,This should not be here as a cam movie. There was reason it made over a 100 million dollars at the box office....it was fucking good!  Dont waste time downloading this cam version. Either see at the movies or wait for a decent upload. To the asshole who uploaded it....FUCK YOU

Certainly not the superman that I was expecting but at least we still have the classics."
,mvcomputers,2013-06-18T08:12Z,I do agree with foxlap. Any effort by a cammer is a good effort. If anyone wants to complain about quality then go buy a movie ticket. Thanks BONE!
,cjay2334,2013-06-18T08:49Z,compared this to original copy that was out and slightly better both audio and visual in my opinion.  Thank you for taking YOUR TIME to upload.  Sorry there are ungrateful pricks that use this site

,bawbzor,2013-06-18T19:47Z,Is this the same source as the 20 other versions that were uploaded yesterday?
,SirenianPrime,2013-06-18T20:08Z,"To those wondering, the whole movie makes it on there, but please, for the love of god and sega genesis, do not watch this if you have not seen it in theaters! It does not do it justice."
