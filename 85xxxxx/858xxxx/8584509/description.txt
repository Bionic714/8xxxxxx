This volume does much more than survey modern advanced color processing.
Starting with a historical perspective on ways we have classified color, it
sets out the latest numerical techniques for analyzing and processing colors,
the leading edge in our search to accurately record and print what we see. The
human eye perceives only a fraction of available light wavelengths, yet we
live in a multicolor world of myriad shining hues. Colors rich in metaphorical
associations make us "purple with rage" or "green with envy" and cause us to
"see red." Defining colors has been the work of centuries, culminating in
today's complex mathematical coding that nonetheless remains a work in
progress: only recently have we possessed the computing capacity to process
the algebraic matrices that reproduce color more accurately. With chapters
on dihedral color and image spectrometers, this book provides technicians and
researchers with the knowledge they need to grasp the intricacies of today's
color imaging.
