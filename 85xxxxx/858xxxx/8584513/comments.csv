,darkrats,2013-06-17T22:23Z,"Not sure why anyone would take the time to download a 2.7 GB rar file, with no details of its contents, from a non-rated poster. If you really want to share then maybe post the books a few at a time. I see you're not seeding at this time. Just as well. That 2.7 GB could be anything."
,notuboo,2013-06-18T02:05Z,"List of book titles or even just author names would be wonderful. Can do without cool reader or calibre as an added bonus.

This is like being a kid at Christmas with a huge box all wrapped up nice with a bow. It could hold many, wonderful toys. But then you open it and it is full of socks.  Thanx for the gift, but I already have enough socks."

,bhosea,2013-06-18T05:05Z,"darkrats, notuboo.....I see that neither of you have ever uploaded a torrent before. At least I try. If the problem is you can't read then it's best to stick to the videos."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-18T07:10Z,"...Sorry kids, it's one thing to download 400 books by and for MUFON Morons, but for all of them to be in one huge file, with no list of contents, well, sounds to me like someone's pushing trojans a la reticulan today, all you can eat."
,PHDIKOULAS,2013-06-18T08:20Z,THIS LEGIT OR NOT NIGGERS
,Frankenchrist,2013-06-18T16:35Z,What kind of CIA/NSA operation is this?
,bhosea,2013-06-18T17:31Z,It's FBI scumbag!
,bhosea,2013-06-18T17:34Z,Somewhere along the line somebody got the idea I give a shit if you download this or not. I don't care. In fact it easier on my bandwith if you don't. PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!
