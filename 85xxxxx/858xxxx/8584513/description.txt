This is a culmination of over 400 ebooks from my own collection and from ebooks I have downloaded over the years. 

I have also included a free, multi-format, open source ebook reader called CoolReader and a multi-format file conversion utility & ebook reader named Calibre (in both 32 & 64 bit versions) for your convenience.

I have scanned these files with ESET Smart Security and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and they came up clean.
