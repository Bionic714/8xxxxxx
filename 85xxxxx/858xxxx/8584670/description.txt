Information
------------------------------

Liz Bonnin joins a team of scientists and cameramen in Russia who are studying one of the world's rarest animals, the Siberian tiger. 
Part 1.
The Siberian tiger is one of Earth's rarest and most elusive animals, with as few as 300 remaining. It is so rare, more scientists have been to space than have seen one in the wild. In this series, Liz Bonnin, a former tiger biologist herself, travels to the frozen forests of the Russian Far East to help a team of scientists studying these big cats. Their goal is to uncover the hidden world of this mysterious predator, determine why they are declining and what can be done to save them. When three orphaned cubs are discovered, the team launch a desperate rescue mission. Cameraman Max Hug Williams joins rangers in the race against time to find the cubs as a blizzard approaches - capturing remarkable footage in the process.
Part 2.
Liz Bonnin and the team return to the Russian Far East to track endangered Siberian tigers. The Siberian tiger is one of Earth's rarest and most elusive animals. As Liz Bonnin and cameraman Max Hug-Williams return to the snowy Russian forests they uncover a problem: only a few hundred 'snow tigers' remain in the wild and breeding females are in particularly short supply. Max is following a female tiger called Varvarra to see if she has new cubs, while Liz searches for a female called Princess who has gone missing. The team rescue an orphaned tiger cub, but have they found him in time?
