
Porcupine Tree - Stars Die (The Delerium Years 91-97) [only1joe] MP3-320 kbps

U.K. art rock outfit Porcupine Tree devotes an entire box set to their early- to mid-'90s downtempo/prog rock period. Stars Die: The Delerium Years '91-97, narrows its focus to the group's psychedelic, pre-ambient Pink Floyd era that relied heavily on guitarist/founder Steve Wilson's more pop-oriented -- but still epic -- compositions. The two discs pack 21 assorted rarities, previously unreleased tracks, and new mixes into an elegant box featuring a deluxe 40-page booklet that's worth the price of the collection itself. Listeners looking for an entry point into this Porcupine Tree period would do well giving this anthology a shot, while fans of acts like Ozric Tentacles, Tangerine Dream, and Flying Saucer Attack, who have remained in the dark about the group, will likely find them to be a new and wonderful addiction..
