'Salmon Doubts'

Alternative Comics, 2004, 128 pages

Written and Illustrated by Adam Sacks

Beautifully illustrated and deeply imaginative, the cast of conversing fish in Salmon Doubts philosophize about the meaning of life as they make their ultimate journey upstream to spawn. With lushly-rendered artwork, uproarious humor, intricately imagined settings, and striking, inventive page layouts, Adam Sacks envelops readers with his genius. The characters in Salmon Doubts fall outside the conventions of the "funny animal" or "anthropomorphic" comics genres - they look like animals, and do not wear little waistcoats or drive little automobiles. But saddled with the full weight of consciousness and speech, they testify just as much to the Human Condition as to Natural Selection.
