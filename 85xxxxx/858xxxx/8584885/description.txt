I was trying to find a torrent that wasn't dead for this movie to no avail.
I was able to find it in a nauseatingly ad infested direct download file sharing site with a download speed of less than 100 kB/s and frequent time outs.

Now that the file is free, I felt it was my duty to liberate it to the more civilized protocol.

It's worth seeing.

I left the file name untouched as is to give the author credit where credit is due.

Synopsis 

A young Pennsylvania man moves to Los Angeles to begin work for an ambulance service. There he is teamed with a supremely confident vet who seemingly has gone through a large number of partners. Initially the novice is awed by the more experienced man's capabilities to deal with the high pressure situations they encounter. However, gradually he discovers that all is not as it seems. While the vet is ice on the surface, he actually gets through the ordeals by heavy drug use and avoids commitments. Soon the younger man finds himself pulled into the same world and has to decide what direction he wants to take.
