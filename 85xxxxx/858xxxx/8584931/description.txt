The art is amazing, at once completely nonrepresentational and realistic to the last detail. The plot reveals the origin of Waldo: he is Judas Iscariot, reincarnated as a demon who looks like a cat. Waldo liberates Jesus from the cross while visiting the detox ward of a hospital ("So, you finally came back, huh?" Waldo asks), while an orderly discovers the Turin-like shroud of the title, with Waldo's image on it. The orderly is in fact a man who condemned Jesus at Gethsemane, and who has wandered immortal ever since; Waldo/Judas has been reincarnated to help redeem the orderly.
