Later in his career, Glanzman used his experiences with the U.S.S. Stevens for several short stories in Marvel's 'Savage Tales', titled 'Of War and Peace: Tales by MAS' (1986), while also drawing for Marvel's 'Semper Fi' comic book. Even more explicitly autobiographical work appeared in the two graphic novels 'A Sailor's Story (Marvel, 1987) and 'A Sailor's Story 2: Winds, Dreams and Dragons' (Marvel, 1989), and a 10-page story published by DC in 1992. Glanzman remained active until the mid 1990s, doing inking chores for DC's 'Jonah Hex', Acclaim's 'Turok Dinosaur Hunter' and Topps' 'Zorro'. His final published comic stories were his contributions to the anthologies 'Streetwise' (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2000) and '9-11: The World's Finest Comic Book Writers & Artists Tell Stories to Remember' (2002). After that, Glanzman focused on webcomics, creating the historical adventure series 'Apple Jack' and 'The Eagle', the latter in cooperation with Will Franz.
