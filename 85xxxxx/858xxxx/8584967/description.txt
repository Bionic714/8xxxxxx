"...deftly weaves together the spiritual and the mundane, truth and rumour, into what is ultimately a human story about one of the most ambitious people ever to live. A work to savour and return to." From the foreword by Richard Kaczynski Author of "Perdurabo: The Life of Aleister Crowley".

Know then the life and times of England's most infamous son. Occultist, artist, poet, prophet, record-setting mountaineer, drug and free-love pioneer, spy, scholar, and legendary bad-egg. Summoner of demons and loser of friends. An explorer of many realms who conversed with gods and angels but ended his days labelled "The Wickedest Man in the World." Aleister Crowley. A foolish genius. A much maligned history. A wanderer of the waste.
