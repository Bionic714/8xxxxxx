Your so called shaven era has just begun. Then in the future we will probably completely loose our hair, then pubic hairs may be in someways more sought after... Until we drop our skins. and take on some new more fitting form for our species. Then we certainly won't go around fucking these hairy creatures.
But as things are looking today.. You'd just have to stick around for the end of mankind. Can't be that far of."
