Thanks for the ul, LeonardTSpock!

These once a month excursions of yours is far, far to infrequent.

You have so much to share, and so little time in which to ul!"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-18T01:18Z,"Thanks again for the kind words, binderguy1. Man, you have no idea. I could upload nonstop, 24 hour a day for the next two weeks and I might get through half of what I already have ready to upload. But I kind of like it this way. It gives people a chance to absorb some of the books they download instead of just constantly stockpiling. Also, it makes what I do upload more of a random experience. I've got so much ready to go that I often forget what I was planning on uploading and then rediscover it the next time. "
