Ok heres our take on the man of steel ....
Video we were kindly given some vobs of this but have to say they wasn't the
best.
The video had some major pixel break ups aswell as being dark,along with other
issues.
Anyway made a script for the video and then dropped that into vdub ....used null
to crop and then resized  and then had to use the HQ smoother on really high
settings,alot higher than i would normally like :(
Also then tweaked brightness,contrast,rgb colours etc.....and 19hrs later,still
looks poo.
Ok not too bad but better than nothing i guess....have viewed on a small 21" tv
and looks better.

Audio ...stripped the old and in with the new.
Audio is was better but was too loud and powerful,well as having some background
noise so dropped in adobe and gave it some lovin before syncing to our encode.
Sync is 95% in i would say but due to some dark scenes and fast action where the
video is poo it was hard to check.

If i'm honest and you want HQ then please wait this WILL not be for you !!
V6 A6 tops in IMHO.
