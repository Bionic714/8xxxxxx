Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Monday, June 17 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex analyzes the accelerating trend towards transhumanism, or the merging of man with machine, as a Russian multimillionaire announces he's quite serious immortality can be achieved by 2035. 

We'll also continue discussing the subversion of the Constitution, as one student's First Amendment rights are trampled upon for wearing a shirt supporting the Second, up to and including being accused of making "terroristic threats." 

On today's show, Alex welcomes television broadcaster and economic analyst Max Keiser to break down the fallout from Bilderberg 2013 coverage and the collapse of the current bankster regime, as well as the goal of G8 protests in Belfast. 

Alex will also touch on other important news items like Obama's plunging approval rating, the controversial amnesty bill, and news that IRS targeting of Conservative groups was further widespread than previously reported.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
