This is NOT a demo.

It's the Alpha and is invite only and WILL NOT work
because only those who have access to the BF4 Battlelog page can use it.... no invite, no access.... useless file."

This is not a demo

This is the BF4 Alpha [Already uploaded by 3DM BTW].

Unless you have an BF4 Alpha invite account
then you will not be able to use this.
