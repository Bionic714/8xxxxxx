This torrent contains Episodes 2x04 to 3x07 (11 episodes) of Robotica, originally on TLC between 2002-2003.  That's all but the first three of season 2, and the entirety of season 3.

They're recorded at 640-480 as mkvs, which was taken from personal VHS recordings I had hidden for years.

I won't list the entirety of the match lineups, but this does include the fabled match between Ultraviolence and Tiger Woods.  Best use of a wooden robot ever.


If you have any more of the episodes available, upload them and post a link in the comments.  This series has become to hard to find for how amusing it was compared to the rest of the robot wars-style series.

Enjoy the rantings of Ahmet Zappa!
