Ripped and scanned from my own collection. Cue files edited by hand, and should work like a playlist if your media player supports cuesheets. Includes an .iso rip from The Bill Murray EP included DVD, I didn't convert because I wanted downloaders to have the option to convert it to whatever video format they wish. Scans were mostly done in 300x300 ppi. Enjoy, and if you like their music please buy their albums off of urbnet or their site.
