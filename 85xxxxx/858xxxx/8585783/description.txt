Hello!
This is a realm of the mad god client that I've put together for you guys today. using it is as simple as extracting the contents to wherever you like and then running the "realm.exe". once you do that it will load up the regular realm of the mad god client, no hacks or anything (yet). you can go online to find a few clients for yourself. but I've already included a few to get you started. to add a custom client just download any .swf client from the internet and add it to the "clients" folder in the files you extracted

to run your own client, or one of the ones I've included. all you have to do is press the menu button at the bottom right of the client, then on the right side pane that opens up, select the dropdown menu and choose a client. I've also added an item spawner(IN BETA). don't expect it to work 100% of the time. 

DISCLAIMER: THE ITEM SPAWNER WILL SHOW AS A FALSE POSITIVE, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
