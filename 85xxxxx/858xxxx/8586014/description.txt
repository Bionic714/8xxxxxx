Minette Walters became famous for her creepy version of detactive stories, notably The Ice House. This is her very first effort on screen; it's not as good as The Ice House, but still very moving. The story is a bit ragged, but the atmosphere more than makes up for it.

My upload of The Ice House was ripped from tape, this is ripped from DVD using a superior programme, Enjoy!
