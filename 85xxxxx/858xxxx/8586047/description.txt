Author Scott Calhoun has visited the gardens of top designers from coast to coast and selected more than 100 stunning plant combinations, each using no more than six plants, to include in this photographic guide. Riots of complementary colors, masses of grasses, foliage spectacles in extraordinary shades of green and purple, and height variations as arresting as city skylines are all featured in these exciting gardens, each one an intimate glimpse of a larger garden. A favorite pairing can be the beginning of a larger garden design, or a five-plant grouping might be all you need to fill a small urban garden. The possibilities are as varied as your imagination!
