This is the social contract of TPB. But this show has forced me to rebel. Imagine an elephant with huge sweaty balls. Now, imagine a pseudo celebrity (perhaps Kim Kardashian) sucking on the aforementioned balls of said mammal. While being raped in the anuss with a cactus. Watching that would be more enjoyable than this show. In fact I'm going to IMDB in order to make a scalding post about it right now! Also - eztv - stop with the spam trackers. I don't care how many people are potentially seeding; I only care how many actual seeders there are. Apart from that - great job, eztv!
Now I must go and eat unleavened bread and rub ashes into my hair in order to purge my soul after watching the first episode of this ""TV show"""
,darklordvyper,2013-06-19T08:43Z,"@svonka, I'm sorry you don't like the show. You must be one of those people who enjoy watching True Blood, or shows with no original storyline. Defiance has an original setting, characters, and a unique plot, which is more than can be said about 90% of shows being broadcast presently. Go ahead and whine on IMDB. No one cares."
