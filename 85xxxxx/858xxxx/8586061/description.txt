Johnny Stecchino (Toothpick Johnny) is a funny movie, where Roberto Benigni plays, opposite his wife (who is also his wife in real life,) as a mafia guy who "grassed" (told) on his mafia friends while in New York (it happened b4 the movie started.) 

He went back to Palermo, and now the mafia wants to kill him. So his wife (Nicoletta Braschi) comes up with a plan to find a guy who looks like Toothpick Johnny, so the gangsters will kill him instead.

Hilarity ensues. I hardcoded it with English subtitles, all in one file, an .avi file. Enjoy. And, as always, don't forget to seeeeeed. Roberto Benigni gets so many awards for the films he writes/directs, mostly comedies.
