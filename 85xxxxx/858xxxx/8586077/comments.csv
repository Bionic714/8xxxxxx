Also, does anyone either have the third disc to the recent Wings Over the World reissue with the live at The Cow Palace bonus tracks? If so, please post it or post a link to someone who does here in these comments. I've found one going around but it's a fake password protected rar file that is just trying to get people to take some survey."
,lastjedi,2013-06-18T06:58Z,sad thing is now it says 65 leechers and this was just put up today.so people who downloaded this couldnt even seed it for 1 day.it says this will finish downloading in 38 weeks and 4 days and it goes from that to infinity symbol.downloading at 0.1kb.so  i'm not getting anything.
,NCC86,2013-06-18T09:07Z,I'm getting 120-150kbps at the moment and I'm at 6% after three hours or so downloading non-stop. I think I'll have it wrapped up before the day is out.
,lastjedi,2013-06-18T10:14Z,great after seeing it say 37 leechers now it says 146 leechers and i have been trying to download for hours now still at 0.1kb.says it will be done in 6 years and 6 weeks.
