Man's landing on the moon was our greatest technological
achievement. The Apollo 11 mission was truly the stuff of
dreams. For the first time, our species walked on another
celestial body. Even more remarkable was their ability to make
it back. This is the story of the July 20, 1969, Apollo 11
moon landing. Drama with digitally remastered original footage

Fun fact:

When this movie first aired on the History Channel (US), the
moment when the character of Neil Armstrong puts his foot on
the moon was timed to within a minute of the 40th anniversary
of Armstrong actually stepping on the moon.
