'Romancing Saga Artbook - Time Weaver'

Gashuu Tokioribhito did at least some of the art. Not sure if he did all of it because I don't read Japanese.

I don't know what this is. I gather that 'Romancing Saga' is a video game that has existed across multiple platforms in Japan and is imported to the States (at least that's what it looks like on Amazon). It may or may not have something to do with Final Fantasy (honestly, I never played that one - I do my role-playing on paper). I DO know that this art is pretty cool, so I decided to go ahead and share this one.
