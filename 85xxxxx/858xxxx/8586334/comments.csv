Having the book in hard form I can confirm that the scan is complete (pictures and text). The difference in the page numbers is due to the fact that some pictures are spread over 2 pages but are counted as one by the comic book viewer;a few blank pages were left out too (as you already said).
All in all a great book about a fantastic artist.
