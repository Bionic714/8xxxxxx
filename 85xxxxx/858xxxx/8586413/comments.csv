Seriously, Xenu in DC-8 ships? Earth was called ""Teegeeack"" and populated by over 100 billion sentient creatures, yet there is absolutely ZERO evidence of it. Anywhere. Even the slightest bit.

At least the dumbshit christians based their stories on their narrow-minded and uneducated interpretations of actual events."
