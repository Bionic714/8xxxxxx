[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T14:59Z,"and yeah my friend, underwhelmed is right."
,Ahlat,2013-06-18T15:31Z," So much for the unguessable ending, we already knew of time being messed up and of Angela, only the Galactus thing I wasn't aware of. The fact that he will be in the Ultimate Universe that is, I knew there would be a Galactus story spinning out of Age of Ultron. 

Anyways you're welcome STFmaryville and them not plugging their leak is good for us."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T15:59Z,"very true!

y'know, they already did a version of galactus for ultimate marvel, and warren ellis wrote a very good -- and very different -- plot for that.

ultimate sales are low, so my guess is that they're going to have galactus actually eat the ultimates' earth. did you see the pictures of the upcoming mighty avengers relaunch? could be miles morales in that spider-man suit?"
,Keeeeevin,2013-06-18T17:25Z,"Guys NO SPOILERS!!! :) pls? Let's not make it worse... if u choose to dl n read early thats cool just pls dont spoil anything, thanks :)"
,Keeeeevin,2013-06-18T17:27Z,"Also this MUST BE a MARVEL Employee... has to be an inside job. Older ""ScanBro"" scans were a hint but a polybagged final issue? Yea... Marvel's got a rat on the inside"
,Ahlat,2013-06-18T18:04Z,"I'm sorry Keeeeevin, forgot I was spoiling the comic. >_<

Yeah STFmaryville I think they're ending the Ultimate universe too. What issues did Warren Ellis write in Ultimates? Also the upcoming Mighty Avengers has SpOck in it, that's just his new costume he's getting soon. Also Bendis says that the pages are out of order and that some are missing. You think he's talking about the ads?"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T18:26Z,"sorry everyone, i shoulda done a spoiler notice!

having said that, if you're downloading a comic and want to read it 1st, never read the comments until you read it!

i don't think it has to be a marvel employee. i honestly think it's someone who gets print copies on monday. could even be someone working at the printers, that's been my theory since the amazing spider-man 700 leak...

and who said anything 'bout scanbro? scanbro died!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T18:35Z,"Ahlat, Warren Ellis wrote ""the Ultimate Galactus trilogy"" of miniseries. they are: Ultimate Nightmare #1-5 (with Trevor Hairsine and Steve Epting, 2004–2005), Ultimate Secret #1-4 (with Steve McNiven and Tom Raney, 2005), and Ultimate Extinction #1-5 (with Brandon Peterson, 2006).

unrelated, but he also wrote ultimate fantastic four #7-18, and later, 2 other miniseries: ultimate human and ultimate armor wars."
,Ahlat,2013-06-18T18:59Z,"Thanks STFmaryville, I'll definitely check them out."
,George0208,2013-06-19T04:11Z,"Big TY Ahlat, good story and better ending.They were reminded about the time line and their abuses of it."
,George0208,2013-06-19T04:13Z,"BIG TY Ahlat ,good story and better ending,I thought that was gonna happen because they were warned about theit abuses of the time-line"
,X-STORM,2013-06-19T04:41Z,What's with the quality? :(
