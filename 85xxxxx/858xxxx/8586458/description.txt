DESCRIPTION:
He woke up in a research lab and now can not remember anything except his own name. All the people he meets along the way, to fear him or want to kill. A mysterious organization is hunting for him as a dangerous animal, wanting to get alive or dead. But John Vattik, maimed and deprived of memory, not so defenseless as it may seem at first glance. Monstrous experiments turned John into a powerful telepath whose capabilities can control inanimate objects as well as living people! With such weapons, John becomes a formidable opponent for anyone who tries to stand in his way, and the desire to know the truth and punish those responsible for making it even more dangerous.
