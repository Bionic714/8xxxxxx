Yoshitaka Amano has done an incredible amount of work over the course of his life. And trust me, even if you don't recognize his name, you have seen his work. A small selection of his projects includes Speed Race, Vampire Hunter D, Final Fantasy and Sandman: The Dream Hunters. You can read more about the man and his work right here...

I am a huge fan of this mans work. I own his Complete Prints book and it's likely one of the things I would grab on my way out the door if the house was on fire. Colorful, dense but not cluttered, wispy dreamlike lines and page layouts. To my eyes, this man creates some truly beautiful art.
