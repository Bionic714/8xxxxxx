This is a recording I did as a kid back on Sept. 24th 1987. The station was KNX 1070 news radio out of Los Angeles and they would play "old time radio shows" also known as "OTR". Show would run 1 hour from 9pm to 10pm and repeat at 2am seven days a week. These were recorded on a huge Goldstar boombox at my home in Long Beach California.
I have a couple more tapes of the drama hour to upload also so check back.
