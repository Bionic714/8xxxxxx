Why use Growl?
It works out of the box.
When you start up a Growl-enabled application, it will just work. There's no complicated setup; just install Growl once and your apps can start displaying notifications right away.
Everything in one place.
Growl centralizes all your notification preferences into its preferences - you can control them all from one place, and you know exactly how they are going to behave.
Know what happened while you were away.
Keeps working even when you are not. Come back to your mac and review what happened while you were gone with Rollup.
