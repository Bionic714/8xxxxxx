Storyline:  
This all takes place in the forgotten back-allies of San Francisco's Chinatown in the mid- '80s:
When trucker Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) agreed to take his friend Wang Chi (Dennis Dun) to pick up his fiancée at the airport, he never expected to get involved in a supernatural battle between good and evil. Wang's fiancée has emerald green eyes, which make her a perfect target for an immortal sorcerer named Lo Pan (James Hong) and his three invincible cronies. Lo Pan must marry a girl with green eyes so he can regain his physical form. Now, Jack must save Wang's fiancée from Lo Pan and his henchmen, and win back his stolen truck. But how can he defeat an enemy who has no body?

Compatibility: 
Works on my Sammie 46" 7100 Series 3D 1080p LED HDTV. I can hook my WD Passport {or even a memory stick}  hard drive up to the USB connection {on the input panel} and it works. I personally run it through my Sammie Blu Ray player {through the front USB port} so I can use my Onyko TX-SR875 Audio/Video Processor for better sound and picture. Plug and Play no conversion necessary!

Plays With: WMP {11}, PowerDVD, Nero Kwik Media, QuickTime, and played it on my Droid Maxx as is. Haven't tried any others but doesn't seem to have any problems playing on whatever I open it with it's .MP4 should play on most anything.
