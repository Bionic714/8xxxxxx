Shipping Wars: Season 1 
Each episode of "Shipping Wars" dives into the cutthroat world of heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport the unshippable. The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.




7)  Tavern on the Greenbacks 
Roy heads back in to New York City when he outbids the other transporters for a job moving a catering food truck from the city's famous restaurant, Tavern On the Green. When he arrives and finds the truck in non-operational condition, Roy quickly becomes a mechanic and machine shop worker, but tensions rise when the buyer isn't willing to pay him for his extra work. Jarrett picks up a 400-lb wooden African sculpture that should make for easy money, but when he's forced to repair his not-so-trusty cargo van, he must find additional loads to stay in the black

8)  Jennifers Arch 
Jennifer may have taken her livestock specialty too far when she tops the transporters in an auction to ship a number of small animals. Between the smell, the constant feedings, and the never-ending squeals, it may be the last run Jennifer makes with so many critters. Jarrett outbids Marc in the competition to haul a go-kart in the shape of a miniature semi-tractor trailer. Moving it up the coast, he must deliver the tiny automobile in time for a local Shriner event, which will feature an entire fleet of mini semis turned go-karts. But when his van breaks down once again, it may be the last straw for this rookie's unreliable transportation

9)  Baja or Bust 
Marc is headed to Mexico when he wins an auction to ship a $100,000 Baja 1000 Trophy Truck. Leaving from Colorado, Marc must protect his precious cargo, and make sure it arrives without delay in time for the start of the famous race. But when he gets lost on the small back roads in Tijuana, Marc must get resourceful or risk putting the race team, and his career, in last place. Scott and Susie take their boat hauling knowledge to a whole new level when they transport a wooden pirate ship across the southwest. But as they put the miles behind them, the fragile pirate ship gets more and more difficult to keep tied down.

10)  May the Ship be with You 
Roy lands the shipment of his dreams when he gets to haul some large one-of-a-kind props from his favourite sci-fi movie. But when he is cut-off by another trucker on the highway, he's afraid it may have damaged these priceless movie artifacts. Jennifer outbids fellow rookie, Jarrett, for a shipment of 20 peacocks headed to Arizona. With the exotic birds confined to small boxes for transport, she must cover nearly two thousand miles in three days, otherwise Jennifer risks killing the fowl from the stress of travelling.
