The Class 50 for Train Simulator, developed by Meshtools, is available in a variety of BR and privatised liveries, including BR Blue (TOPS and Pre-TOPS), Great Western Railway Green and BR Dual Green, Network South East Blue (original and revised) and BR Large Logo. Features of the model include independently operated screen wipers, four position reverser, two-tone horn, opening cab windows, operating sun visors and configurable locomotive running numbers and names.

The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the Class 50 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included are scenarios specifically for the Settle to Carlisle route (available separately and required to play these scenarios).
