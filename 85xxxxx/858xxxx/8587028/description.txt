A little lie can change the course of everything. . .

Like every other eighteen-year-old in love, Olivia has dreams of spending forever with the love of her life. Luke is all sheΓÇÖs ever wanted ΓÇô until she overhears something she was never meant to. In a matter of seconds, OliviaΓÇÖs heart is shattered. Olivia handles it the only way she knows how - she runs- leaving behind her family, friends and the boy she loves. 

Seeking comfort and an escape, Olivia finds it in resident bad boy Deacon. HeΓÇÖs everything Luke isnΓÇÖt ΓÇô and thatΓÇÖs fine with Olivia.

Now, seven years later, Olivia is older, wiser and headed back to Chicago looking forward to a fresh start and reconnecting with her best friend Pyper. What she doesnΓÇÖt expect, is to come face to face with the boy she left behind and discover that even though she may have left, her feelings for him didnΓÇÖt. 

Can Olivia put aside the pain in her heart and trust Luke? Will the ties to her past ever let her go, or will she continue to let her life be affected by pretty little lies?
