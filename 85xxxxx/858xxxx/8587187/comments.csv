,NisariK,2013-06-18T18:11Z,"Wow, I was doubting if I should bother with this game, but those screenshots changed my mind!
Jokes aside, thanks for uploading, I have the older version on android and it's disappointing aftera  while, if this is any good I might buy it."

,Silvak,2013-06-19T02:07Z,Possibility of getting Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara?
,nulldome,2013-06-19T08:07Z,"I don't get this, all the players act on their own. How do I get to control them? All they do is auto-attack shit."
,nulldome,2013-06-19T08:17Z,This game makes no sense. All the players are acting automatically. I can't select any skills and they just autoattack.
