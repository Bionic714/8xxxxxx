  Set out on a grand adventure in this turn-based, retro style, pixel-art
  RPG, inspired by the great titles of the 90's. Take on the roles of
  in-game players taking on the roles of their characters in a traditional
  pen and paper RPG session in the ultimate meta roleplaying experience.

  As both the playing characters AND the game master, players can choose
  which battles to fight. Put together a bunch of monsters to make for a
  challenging fight and your efforts will be equally rewarded!

  Choose from multiple classes, such as knights and mages, pick your
  characters to control those classes, like grandma or kid brother, and take
  on the loads of quests, monsters, items and equipment littered throughout
  Knights of Pen & Paper +1 Edition. Blacksmiths, enchanters, mining,
  gathering, hidden treasures and a whole lot more await, giving players a
  lot of room to personalize their gameplay experience.

  Don't wait any longer, the Pen & Paper world needs you!
