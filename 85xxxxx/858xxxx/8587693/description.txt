*** Announcement ***

This is the last episode of BBC HARDtalk that will be uploaded by
"HardTalk". This is for two reasons:
1) Technical issues which cause a new DVD must be used every single
   episode. This is too expensive in the long run.
2) A lack of willingness of most downloaders to seed up to a normal
   ratio.

The obvious and already mentioned consequence is that that there will
be no more new releases of BBC HARDtalk, not by "HardTalk" anyway.
A less obvious consequence is that all currently seeded torrents of
BBC HARDtalk will be taken offline today and many of them will proba-
bly die immediately or pretty soon.

The row between the EU and China over solar panels has put the focus on China's overproduction in many areas of industry. Europe says China is dumping solar panels at a price that is lower than the cost of production. Overcapacity is a big problem for China in many sectors. Zeinab Badawi talks to Zhu Min, former deputy at People's Bank of China, now deputy managing director at the IMF. Is the Chinese business model in danger of collapse?
