THE FILM


An extraordinary journey to the top of the world, the documentary adventure “To The Arctic” tells the ultimate tale of survival. Narrated by Oscar winner Meryl Streep, the film takes audiences on a never-before-experienced journey into the lives of a mother polar bear and her twin seven-month-old cubs as they navigate the changing Arctic wilderness they call home.
Captivating, adventurous and intimate footage brings moviegoers up close and personal with this family’s struggle to survive in a frigid environment of melting ice, immense glaciers, spectacular waterfalls, and majestic snow-bound peaks.
Warner Bros. Pictures and IMAX® Filmed Entertainment present a MacGillivray Freeman Film, “To The Arctic,” a One World One Ocean presentation, directed by two-time Academy Award®-nominated filmmaker Greg MacGillivray (“The Living Sea,” “Dolphins”).
