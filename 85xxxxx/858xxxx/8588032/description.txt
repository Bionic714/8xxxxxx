Hello PirateBay

This is my first torrent, a collection of Asatru books and webpages I have found over the past few months.

Asatru is a pagan religion, with belief in the Gods/Goddesses of the Vikings. I figured if anyone wanted to learn more about it they would come here (which I did when I needed to find books and had no money), so I thank whomever I got the books from (I can't remember your name but THANK YOU!). 

I apologize for the slow seeding, my internet connection is rather bad. Once I organize the rest of my music into one folder, I'll probably upload that as well.

Thanks,

Asatruer
