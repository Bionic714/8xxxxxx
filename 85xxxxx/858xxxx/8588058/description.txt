Big Bill Morganfield - 2001 - Ramblin' Mind

Due to some sly humor, a few jazz-oriented numbers (including "Mellow Chick Swing"), and the consistently strong material, this blues set is also recommended to fans of straight-ahead jazz. Ranging from a couple swinging pieces and some lowdown Muddy Waters-type blues to two strong appearances by Taj Mahal, this is a release that never lets up. Mr. B's piano solos are a major joy, the harmonica playing (by Bill Lupkin, Billy Branch, and Paul Oscher) is excellent, Morganfield's expressive vocals always hit their mark, and the music is quite enjoyable. Highly recommended. (AllMusic)
