This is the story of Doogal, an adorable candy-loving mutt
who goes on a mission to save the world. Doogal must prevent
the evil sorcerer Zeebad from freezing the earth forever with
the power of the three mysterious legendary diamonds. Joining
Doogal on his big quest are pals Dylan, a guitar-playing
rabbit, Ermintrude, an opera-singing cow, and Brian, a
bashful snail. Hopping on a magic train, they travel over
ice-capped mountains, navigate fiery pits of lava, and sail
across vast oceans on the perilous journey of a lifetime.
Along the way, they learn that the most powerful weapon of
all is their friendship - which even Zeebad's magic cannot
destroy!
