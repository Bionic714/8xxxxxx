T.O.D. Johnston's Bible study lessons are thoroughly researched and written from a layman's perspective. The Holy Bible commentaries are based on Bible study lessons that T.O.D. taught at Paran Baptist Church (located at 1603 Johnsonville Highway, Lake City, South Carolina). T.O.D.'s "Bible Study Lessons on Various Subjects" is primarily based on a series of lessons he taught at Paran Baptist Church.
