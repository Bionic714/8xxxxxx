ΓÇ£An outstanding general study of the Roman military system. . . . The best one-volume treatment of the subject now in existence.ΓÇ¥ΓÇöHistorian
The Roman army was one of the most successful fighting forces in history. Its organization and tactics were highly advanced and were unequaled until the modern era.

This book is the first to examine in detail not just the early imperial army but also the citizensΓÇÖ militia of the Republic and the army of the later Empire. The unprecedented scope and longevity of Roman military success is placed in the context of ordinary soldiersΓÇÖ daily lives, whether spent in the quiet routine of a peaceful garrison or in arduous campaign and violent combat. Key battles and tactics are described, and there are brief biographies of the great commanders.
