,Nightwing1945,2013-06-18T20:37Z,"Is there any word on how long this series is going to last?  I know Tom Taylor is taking over Earth 2 once Robinson leaves, but is this series going to continue?

Oh, and thanks STF!!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T21:31Z,"you're welcome. no way of telling how long, but my guess would be a year because their last 2 video game tie-in books lasted the same (dc universe online legends 26 bi-weekly issues & arkham unhinged 58 weekly digital first issues)."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T21:36Z,"and by the way, if any scanners are out there, please for pete's sake, release injustice: gods among us #3, #4, and #5 -- the print versions!

i request that for two reasons: the story flows better on the traditional comics page; and the artists have been going back and re-inking or re-coloring some pages for better, sharper art!"
