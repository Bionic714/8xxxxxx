Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue from Red Rocks - June 8, 2013


There is a new and exciting sound coming from New Orleans which incorporates the unique N.O. blues and jazz foundation and wrapped in Rock & Roll. It relies heavily on the brass (horn) section which includes trombone, trumpet, a pair of saxophones, and accompanied by drums, bass, and guitar.

Trombone Shorty was the opening act in a concert at Red Rocks on June 8, 2013 that was broadcast live on AVX.tv. Unfortunately, there are a few multi-second audio dropouts early in the show, which are in the broadcast and can't be corrected. Otherwise, the music is fantastic, and played at one of the very best outdoor music venues in the entire world.

Buckjump, American Woman, Mrs Orleans, On Your Way Down, Dumaine St., Encore, Hurricane Season, Craziest Things, St James Infirmary, Do To Me.
