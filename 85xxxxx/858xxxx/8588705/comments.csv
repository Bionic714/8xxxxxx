,crkhouse,2013-06-18T23:23Z,"You're a hero amongst men, STFmaryville. 

Also, i'm not sure if you were able to see my comment from another torrent, but here goes:

hey, just wanted to say thanks for all the Darkness goodness: all issues up to now, cross-overs, etc. not to mention complete Artifacts! now i can hole up in my house and wile away the coming weekend w/ some good craft brews and comics. 

question: would you happen to know if anybody has put up a torrent for Witchblade (complete till current) or if there is a specific torrent for Issues 116-147? That's the only gap I can see right now."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T23:38Z,"BrezNJ, well 2 of them are children's books, but i thought hey -- some parents download torrents.

by the way, you can find many more e-books about superman if you search here on TPB for the old MTCDC Superman torrent."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-18T23:49Z,"crkhouse, it sounds like you downloaded oxbladder's 2 torrents to get to 115? if so, that's good. the first link below will get you 116-147...
http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/6688113/Witchblade_1-147_up_to_date_09_2011

http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8129348/  ...that's for 148-158

...and the last 7 you do have to grab one at a time.

i'd also recommend grabbing http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4026918/Witchblade_Minis_etc

after darkness and artifacts, i really wanted to compile witchblade. but i can't express how big of a headache i suffered through when i did darkness. all the minis, spinoffs and crossovers make it frustrating!"
,soletar,2013-06-19T00:47Z,"Thanks a lot STFMaryville for always deliverign. Am sorry for incessantly disturbing you lately...

I have 2 questions/ requests

1. do you read ALL the comics you upload? if so, i imagine you must read at the speed of light. I am an avid bookworm , but i doubt if i can read that much

2. i particularly loved this torrent....pls is it a FULL exhaustive collection of Black Panther Comics? I noticed the files were labelled Volume 4.

3. Thanks for the Black Widow, Red Sonja Omnibus and Green  Arrow collections...they are simply priceless, will download them one after the other

[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-19T03:13Z,"hey soletar, you're not disturbing me.

1. no. i read what i like, but i recognize that many people read comics that i don't like and that i don't take time to read. so i upload my little pony because i think others will download and enjoy it. (it is 1 of the top 5 or top 10 sellers in the u.s.a. from a publisher that isn't marvel or dc.) but i upload many comics that i love, too.

2. no. black panther:
a) first had a solo series of stories in jungle action
b) and then black panther volume 1 in the 1970's.
c) he had a series in marvel comics presents,
d) a 4-issue miniseries (which i call black panther volume 2) in 1988,
e) a 4-issue miniseries ""panther's prey"" in 1991,
f) and g) then volume 3 and volume 4 from 1998 to 2008.
h) black panther volume 5 came out in 2009, starring his sister!
i) in 2011, daredevil was renamed black panther: the man without fear 
j) later in 2011, renamed to black panther: the most dangerous man alive
...so to answer your question, that isn't full or exhaustive. he has had at least 5 series, perhaps 10 series!

3. i'm glad you like them. i'm often too busy to make torrents, but it's nice to see that my old torrents are still being enjoyed by people."

I feel your pain!  So long have I waited to finally complete my collection and now, thanks to you, it's finally happening.  Tears; i'm shedding tears.
