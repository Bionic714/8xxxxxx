In honor of last weekend's film relaunch of Superman in "Man of Steel", here are some of the best graphic novels and books about Superman from my collection.

This torrent is intended for the casual or lapsed comic book readers, and for new fans that might like to try comics! (Most of these have been included in my series of huge torrents of graphic novels & trade paperbacks, so if you've downloaded those, you may want to pass on this.)

I've renamed the files by the year the story was published, for the benefit of the random movie watchers who stumble in here.

Hey movie fans, if you're new to comics, you can read all of these using free comic book reader software. Two of the most popular are CDisplayEX and ComicRack.
