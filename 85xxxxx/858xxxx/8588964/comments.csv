Sample 1.

V/8 - nice clear picture 
A/8 - very clear audio

Sample 2. 

V/6.5 - night time scene which looks very dark and hard to make out in some places.
A/5 - this is a car chase scene with explosions and gunfire ect. when the gun is firing or the car is flipping/blowing up the audio drops out or becomes so low you can't hear it.

Just my opinion :-)
