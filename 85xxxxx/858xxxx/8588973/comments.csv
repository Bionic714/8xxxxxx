,dmtizzy,2013-06-19T10:07Z,don`t even waste time downloading this shit.Complete nonsense. Camera always shaking and he has to always readjust.More to that poor quality overall
,BostonAl2012,2013-06-19T10:32Z,"How about the ULer?

The quality here is irrelevant, he's got some good UL's are they OK to DL?  No skull but everyone had to start sometime...  

I love the small size, I keep my movies on a 750G drive so size does matter~that's what she said I know...  :)"
