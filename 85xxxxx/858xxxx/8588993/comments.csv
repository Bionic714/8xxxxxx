I heard about this series some years back, but due to a limited budget, I was never able to check it out.  Now I can ... :-)

Is there any chance of you ul-ing OXYMORON gn, and STRANGE ATTRACTORS gn?

Apparently these are worthwhile our time.

No Richard Corben goodness? :-("
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-19T00:49Z,"You're most welcome, bg1. No hits on either of the books you requested right now, but I'll keep checking. Yeah, I have tons more Richard Corben stuff that I'll get around to eventually. Just switchin' it up this time around. "
