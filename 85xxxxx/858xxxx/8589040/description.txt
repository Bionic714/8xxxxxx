The three books offered here are all out of print and very hard to find. They include:

1. Guilt (a spiritual/psychological study and Houselander's longest book by far)

2. The Flowering Tree (devotional poems)

3. The Dry Wood (a novel)

All three are new scans, in searchable pdf format (clearscan), with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.

I expect to be able to upload three or four more books by Houselander within the next couple of weeks.

about the author:

Caryll Houselander (1901-1954) was a lay English artist who became one of the most popular Catholic spiritual writers of modern times. She shared a unique and mystical vision of Christianity and Catholic teachings through her writing. In 1944, The Reed of God, a collection of profound and lyrical essays about Mary, established Houselander as a respected modern spiritual writer.
