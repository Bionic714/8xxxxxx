About the Game:
A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new 
vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos
 and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with 
a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a 
relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and 
unpredictable living planet.

Key Features:
All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes 
including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step 
into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to 
dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will 
build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever 
imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of 
course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if thatΓÇÖs your thing! Want to try 
other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose 
from!
Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both 
online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling 
you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart 
the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to 
any other!
World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of 
Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil
surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a 
universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. 
(Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)
87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust 
after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, 
much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!
Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of 
Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the 
dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, youΓÇÖll 
be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!
Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in 
Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers 
and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of 
the new enemies in Borderlands 2.
Note: The Mac version of Borderlands 2 is available in English, French, 
Italian, German and Spanish only.
