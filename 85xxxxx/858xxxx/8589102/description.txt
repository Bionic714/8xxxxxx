Vince Morley is a man with big problems and a brain tumour like a baby's fist; living with one foot in a monstrous alternate world he calls Cancertown. When the lost and dispossessed of London start tripping over the same cracks in reality he spends his life avoiding, Morley realizes he must confront the residents of Cancertown - and risk finding his place among them.
