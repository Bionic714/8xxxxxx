The Earth is ruled by ruthless alien invaders who came to our planet seeking a mysterious power source known only as Sf-92. Now, one year later, the merciless aliens have crushed the planet's armed forces and annihilated all freedom fighters. All but one: SGT Coleman is Earth's last hope. If he can find Sf-92 then maybe, just maybe, he can use it against the alien conquerors and win mankind's freedom. His search brings him to Clay County: a backward, redneck slice of the deep south that is completely unaware - or too drunk to care - of humanity's subjugation by an alien army. Together with the unlikely allies of Clay County citizens Blake, Vern, Hot Dog, and Root, Coleman sets out to find Sf-92 before the Earth's otherworldly overlords, save mankind, and drink a few cold ones along the way!
