Shipping Wars: Season 1 
Each episode of "Shipping Wars" dives into the cutthroat world of heavy-duty movers as they battle for the chance to transport the unshippable. The competition begins with uShip, the world's largest online auction house for independent truckers. Every day, thousands of shipments are put up for auction. The battle is fierce as the movers have only minutes to bid, and the lowest bidder gets the load. From oversized loads and bulky packages to the truly bizarre, these shippers will haul anything if the price is right. The high-stakes race is on as they set out to deliver the loads in time, and any setback can cost big bucks.




10)  May the Ship be with You 
Roy lands the shipment of his dreams when he gets to haul some large one-of-a-kind props from his favourite sci-fi movie. But when he is cut-off by another trucker on the highway, he's afraid it may have damaged these priceless movie artifacts. Jennifer outbids fellow rookie, Jarrett, for a shipment of 20 peacocks headed to Arizona. With the exotic birds confined to small boxes for transport, she must cover nearly two thousand miles in three days, otherwise Jennifer risks killing the fowl from the stress of travelling.
