Moo0 RightClicker Pro 1.50 Final ML Incl Serial - SceneDL

Moo0 RightClicker Pro is a set of enhancements on the context menu (right click menu) of Windows Explorer. It adds many useful functionalities like duplicating current explorer window, open/move to/copy to bookmarked folders, hiding default context menus, and so forth.

Tips:
- Please create your own optimized right click menu by hiding unwanted menus, rearranging the order of menus, packing similar menus into newly created menu tree folder, changing each menu icon to your own, and so on through the customizer.
- You can always Un-Hide default right click menus like "Send To" from "Customize.." &gt; "UnHide" &gt; ..
- You can show all the menus available by Right-Clicking with Shift-Key.
- It takes time to get used to a new set of menus. Please try it a while.
