
Bob Dylan - Bootleg Series Vol.4 (Live 1966 Royal Albert Hall) [only1joe] FLAC-EAC

Live 1966: The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert is a two-disc live album by Bob Dylan, released in 1998. It was recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall during Dylan's world tour in 1966, hence the quotation marks around the misinformation attribution to the Royal Albert Hall. (Oldham Evening Chronicle - 25 May 1966: "So the knockers are all stations go again. I am referring to the fantastic performance given by Bob Dylan at the Free Trade Hall last Tuesday night... I think Bob put his feelings over to the knockers just great. When someone shouted out to him 'Judas!', he just calmly went to the microphone and quietly drawled 'Ya liar'...") Extensively bootlegged for decades, it is an important document in the development of popular music during the 1960s. The setlist consisted of two parts, with the first half of the concert being Dylan alone on stage performing an entirely acoustic set of songs, while the second half of the concert has Dylan playing an "electric" set of songs alongside his band The Hawks. The first half of the concert was greeted warmly by the audience, while the second half was highly criticized, with heckling going on before and after each song.
