A Star is Chopped

In this week's episode someone is getting Chopped. A Food Network Star must have the knowledge and ability to use a wide range of ingredients and be able to take any combination to new culinary heights. Each of the 10 remaining finalists will be given an exotic ingredient and must be able to use their palate to identify and present what it is. The top two winners will win a seat at the judge's table, alongside Chopped judge Alex Guarnaschelli, while their competitors battle it out in the kitchen, Chopped style.
