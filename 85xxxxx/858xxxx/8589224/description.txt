Horse Latitudes was formed in 2009 by three individuals with the collective vision of playing slow, primitive and powerful music with two bass guitars and ritual drums. Hard to fit into just one genre, the band is influenced by doom metal, black metal, sludge and punk among others.

The lyrical side of Horse Latitudes deals with the ambivalence of being a human both inside and outside the natural world, through symbolical and mythical representations and subjective explorations into oneΓÇÖs personal experience. That includes frustration towards the incompleteness of man-made concepts in light of the nature of the indescribable and uncontrollable non-human world, but also awareness of the potential of awakening through spiritual openness.

The debut album of Horse Latitudes, Gathering, was released on winter solstice of the year 2010 by UKΓÇÖs Aurora Borealis recordings. This was followed by a split 12ΓÇ¥ EP with the doom-death heavyweights Hooded Menace on Doomentia records in 2012. The second Horse Latitudes album, Awakening, was also released on Doomentia records. The year 2012 also saw the release of a very limited Horse Latitudes / Loinen split tape on the cult Russian label Quagmire.

The new Horse Latitudes record called Black Soil will be released as 12ΓÇ¥ LP and cassette tape on Doomentia Records in June 2013 to coincide the UK/Ireland tour in July.
