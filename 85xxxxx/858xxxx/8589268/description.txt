***** Reviews for The Tribloos 2 (PC Version) *****

IndieStatik - ItΓÇÖs like they know all of my weaknesses, brewed them in a pot 
and when dipping the prongs in they pulled out these two games. And the 
stupid thing is I like them.

Gamezebo - Tribloos 2 is a refreshing change of pace for time management fans.

JayIsGames - The Tribloos 2 is a casual simulation game done right. By 
dropping the well-tread overhead perspective and focusing on a few refined 
gameplay elements, it sticks to the basics and does them very, very well.

AllAboutCasualGame - The Trbiloos 2 is a cute, entertaining and unique 
family-fun Time Management/Builder game - there is nothing to complain 
about. Do not be mistaken and look at it as another kiddie arcade-type game 
because the game is worth far more than that, try it and you will be in love
with The Tribloos!!!
