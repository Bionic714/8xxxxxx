
A bright, serene sun; a small but a very beautiful garden with a tranquil pond where in the shadow of algae a gold carp swims lazily; an elderly gardener looks after all this beauty with love and care ΓÇô is there any quiet place in the whole world than this?
But for one little caterpillar who dreams of being a butterfly ΓÇô it is the most dangerous place indeed.
As soon as the gardener sees her, he recalls his martial youth; grabs a stick as a sword and throws himself at her with warlike shouts.
And from above, a hoopoe patrols, awaiting for an opportune moment, and you better not cross his path.
You can hide under the ground and have a bite of a sweet fresh carrot, but the underground belongs to an old fat mole, and he doesnΓÇÖt like unexpected guests.
Tagimoto ΓÇô a beautiful fairy tale for children, where all characters are very similar to people, just very amusing.
