"The world's oceans are in trouble. Warming seas and man-made pollutants are combining to unleash toxic algae blooms that are decimating whales, sea lions and other marine mammals. NOVA explores this crisis through the exploits of Dr. Frances Gulland, a San Francisco veterinarian who runs an ER for marine mammals. Committed to saving these sick animals one at a time, she is also desperately trying to figure out what's killing them."
