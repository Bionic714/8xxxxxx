Follow a practical guide to building 3D cityscapes for games. IAuthor Adam Crespi constructs a city block in 3ds Max utilizing low-polygon modeling and advanced texturing techniques. The course shows how to model common city elements such as buildings, intersections, curbs, and roofs and explains how to expand a city quickly and easily by reusing existing geometry in a modular way. The course also sheds light on simulating real-world detail with baking, lighting, and ambient occlusion techniques and offers a series of best practices for exporting to the Unity gaming engine.

Topics include:
   Understanding the design process and software requirements
   Analyzing concept art for texture and key shadow detail
   Planning differently styled buildings
   Laying out city blocks
   Organizing construction elements and models using layers
   Cloning geometry and texture
   Testing the module for correct floor-to-floor heights
   Arranging, aligning and cloning modular elements
   Building a texture library
   Creating stone, wood, and brick textures
   Constructing texture sheets
   Drawing detail
   Using occlusion as a foundation for dirt
   Preparing for Unity as a world builder
