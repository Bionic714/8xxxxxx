Yes, you read right, it's the classic film rendered into comics form by an art team that will do it justice. Faithfully rendering the slimy scales and talons of terror of the "Gill-Man," penciller Art Adams is packing so much detail into every page that he had to draw it on oversized art board. Just ask inker Terry "Flirting with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome" Austin -- this book will make your eyes bleed! A classic unto itself, don't miss out on this instant collectors' item created by a true dream team of comics art legends.
