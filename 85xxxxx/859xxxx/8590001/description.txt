A cult hit is back, the way it was always meant to be seen, from co-creators Joe Casey and Charlie Adlard. Cameron Daltrey is an L.A. bail bondsman. His specialty is criminals of the superhuman persuasion, the type who rarely make their court dates. Thus, Cameron leads an interesting double life: Bail bondsman by day, masked bounty hunter by night. Packed with extra features, this full-color collection also includes an all-new Codeflesh story by Casey and Adlard - the first original story in seven years!
