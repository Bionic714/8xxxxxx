Henri de Lubac - The Splendour of the Church (Paulist Press, 1956, 1963). 352 pages.


New scan. Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc. Quality is pretty good but not great.


One of the more important works in the Ressourcement movement in Catholic theology.

As you can see from the cover image, this is a scan of the older edition, not the new edition currently available from Ignatius Press. But it's the same book.

description:

Considered by many the bright jewel among the many enriching books of Cardinal Henri de Lubac, this work is a hymn to the beauty of the Church, under some of whose leaders for a time he unjustly suffered. The Splendor of the Church is, in a sense, a personal testimony of the great theologian's humility and love of the Church of Christ. It is also a classic work in the theology of the Church. Indeed, de Lubac's profound insights significantly contributed to Vatican II's Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, Lumen Gentium, especially in its treatment on the Church as mystery and as the Sacrament of Christ.
