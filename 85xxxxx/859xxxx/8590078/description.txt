A bunch of stuff from AnCo, taken from misc sources. None of it is badly transcoded to my knowledge, unless noted below. Everything is properly tagged, just drag and drop to iTunes or whatever you use. Not every single is included, only if they have unique b-sides or remixes on them.

A 24 bit lossless version of Merriweather as well as an MP3 version are included. If you only want one version, uncheck the version you don't want in uTorrent before you download.
