This is also the most expansive city management game yet where you can control a region that delivers true multi-city scale and play a single city or up to 16 cities at once each with different specializations. Multiplayer is also a first for the series, which adds a new dimension to your game as your decisions impact both your city and your region and creates new ways to play by collaborating or competing to earn achievements. Finally, SimCity is a live service that simulates real time updates from new challenges to new features and content.

NOTE!!!!

If you already have origin installed and you use it for games you have already purchased make a copy of your "Hosts" file before you copy the one from the NO DRM RELEASE over! Use the legit one when you want to play your games and then use the NO DRM RElEASE one when you want to play SIMCITY! 

Further notes I have gathered from my previous torrent from user experiences:
-Make sure your Simcity Folder is Not Read Only!(unchecking the read-only box)
-Restart Origin. 
-Run as Administrator 
-PBM.EXE (Pando Media Booster) does interfere with the server. If you are having Problem after problem, check to If PBM.EXE is running in task manager and if so, end it.
