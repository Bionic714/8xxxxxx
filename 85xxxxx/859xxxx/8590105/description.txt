These appear in a collected volume titled 'Will Eisner's New York - Life In The Big City', which is available at TPB in the Will Eisner Collection torrent. The Fantagraphics single issues were never reprinted, so on the off chance that a Will Eisner completeist might want them, or maybe somebody just wants to check them out, I'm going to go ahead and upload them.
