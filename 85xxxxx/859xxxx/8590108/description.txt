In this 3-issue mini-series written by Alan Moore with art by Jim Baikie, it is revealed that I.O. created several variant clones of each Team 7 member, using the DNA collected from them without their knowledge.

I stumbled across this set a couple of weeks ago, read it only because it was a short miniseries and it was written by Moore, and enjoyed it. Please seed and share.  --STF
