[root] Mobile ODIN Pro v3.75

Requirements: Android version 2.1 and higher

Overview: Mobile ODIN - Full firmware flashing straight from the device itself!

Mobile ODIN is the on-device firmware flasher of choice. Just throw those firmware files on your (internal or external) SD card, start Mobile ODIN and flash away.

!!! Your device must be rooted to be able to use Mobile ODIN. Check the list below to see if your device is supported !!!

If you use the EverRoot option, Mobile ODIN will root the firmware while you flash it. Checking out that new leaked firmware? No reason to lose root!

Flashing with Mobile ODIN does NOT increase your custom kernel flash counter or 

make the yellow warning triangle appear.

----- MANUAL -----

Flashing with Mobile ODIN is easy. You start off by starting the app. The app will 

check your system has everything the app needs to continue (like root). It may need 

to download an additional package, so it is advised you have Wi-Fi available.

Now you should see the main Mobile ODIN screen. It will list a set of partitions. 

Clicking a partition will allow you to select a file from your SD card to flash to 

that partition. Do not worry about selecting the wrong file - Mobile ODIN will not 

let you. Separate files (named after the partition) as well as .tar and .tar.md5 

files are supported.

From the desktop ODIN you may be used to "PDA", "PHONE", and "CSC" buttons. All 

three of these buttons have been replaced by the "Open file ..." button. This 

button will open the file you select from the SD card, and find all the partitions 

it can flash inside that file. So if you select a .tar file containing kernel and 

modem, the Kernel and Modem partitions will be set up to use that .tar file for 

flashing.

Now that we have selected what we want to flash, if you have the Pro version you 

can proceed to the EverRoot section. The EverRoot options allows you to root your 

firmware while it is being flashed. Never again will you be without root! Select 

here which apps you want to inject in the firmware that is being flashed.

Now that we are all done selecting partitions and configuring EverRoot, we continue 

to "Flash firmware". Mobile ODIN will gather all the information it needs and 

perform the flash. Before starting, however, it will check that your battery level 

is over 50%, and if applicable offer to verify MD5 checksums on the files you have 

selected to flash. If all is well, it will reboot into recovery mode, and flash the 

firmware you have selected.
