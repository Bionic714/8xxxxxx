Shirley Temple Black ~ America's Sweetheart Vol. 1 and 2 (FLAC)

    Believe me, if all those endearing young charms,
    Which I gaze on so fondly today,
    Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms,
    Like fairy gifts fading away,
    Thou wouldst still be adored, as this moment thou art,
    Let thy loveliness fade as it will;
    And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart
    Would entwine itself verdantly still.

    It is not while beauty and youth are thine own,
    And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear,
    That the fervor and faith of a soul can be known,
    To which time will but make thee more dear.
    No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets,
    But as truly loves on to the close:
    As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
    The same look which she turned when he rose.
