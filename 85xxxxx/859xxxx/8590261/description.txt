Say the name Dan Wilson, and it might not inspire the immediate recognition deserved by a celebrated songwriter who has lent his fertile pen to the likes of the Dixie Chicks (who won the 2006 Song of the Year Grammy with Wilson's co-written "Not Ready to Make Nice"), Jason Mraz, and Mike Doughty, and who gets liner-note kudos from none other than authentic musical guru Rick Rubin. Yet Dan Wilson has definitely logged some miles that warrant respect, first laboring with Minneapolis's neo-psychedelic Trip Shakespeare, then leading rock trio Semisonic to a huge hit and Grammy nomination ("Closing Time"). Free Life marks his solo debut, and it's easy to see that despite admirable collaborations with other artists (guests like Sheryl Crow and the Jayhawks' Gary Louris pop up here and there on Free Life, further testament to Wilson's standing with peer rockers), he saved some of his best ideas for himself. In truth, there are nothing but love stories here, and Wilson's gift for rich and haunting melodies and open, direct lyrics make each song unique, each an intimate peek into the travails of modern infatuation and the occasional heartache. "Sugar," "All Kinds," and the exquisite "Honey Please" express an honest longing too often missing from post-millennium pop music, and the up-tempo title track is a beautiful construction, building from a quiet wisp of acoustic guitar to a lush conclusion. Dan Wilson's Free Life is a rocking and romantic set, and if you didn't know his name before, this record is a great way to get introduced
