Wholeness and Balance Vibrations to everyone as you may already know we are doing a collective cleanse. Due to several requests we have decided to change the start date of the cleanse to give everyone a little more time to clear their schedules, purchase the necessary products while allowing time for those products to arrive, and anything else that may take a little more time than we previously allotted. So our dates have been changed from February 22, 2013 to March 11, 2013. So to be clear we will begin on March 11, 2013.

 

We also encourage members to consider the Colon Cleansing Kit ($76) if they are having monetary constraints with the Complete Internal Cleansing Kit ($234). It is still very effective for the body that has not been cleansed. We are still offering 15% off these products with the promo code "virtual cleanse".
