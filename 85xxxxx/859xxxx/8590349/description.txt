Description: Since childhood dreaming to have a family, 12-year-old Hollis Woods has had time to visit many foster homes. Escaping from the last of the family home Reagen, she takes up residence in a new foster mother, a retired art teacher, Josie Cale. Hollis - a talented artist, whose life stories are revealed through her drawings. On one such figure she portrayed his wish, she drew a family. She has found a family with Reagen, but fear of attachment and feelings of guilt made her escape. As soon as forgetfulness Josie was getting worse, Hollis increasingly feels responsible for the woman and the desire to take care of a loved one. Thanks to her work, and taking care of Josie, Hollis Woods finds her family. The film is based on the eponymous book.
