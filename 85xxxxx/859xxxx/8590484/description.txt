This is a unofficial uploading of Starac's Skyrim Realistic Overhaul. Skyrim Realistic Overhaul is not a overhaul like Skyrim Redone, but is rather a comprehensive texture pack for Skyrim (like Skyrim HD or Serious HD, but with an aim towards vanilla friendliness and realism)

Without a doubt, this is one of, if not oughtright, the best texture packs ever relased for Skyrim. It used to be on the Nexus, but a complicated situation caused it to be taken down.
 
Both the extra Dawnguard textures and the 1.6 update are included in this torrent. The 4k mountain textures are not included (but I don't see a reason to - 4k is very big)

This is the 1k sized version of Skyrim Realistic Overhaul. Recommended for users with lower VRAM or with users of multiple big texture packs.

Installation: just add the files manually in your favorite mod manager and activate them.
