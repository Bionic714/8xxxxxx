This is a unofficial uploading of Starac's Skyrim Realistic Overhaul. Skyrim Realistic Overhaul is not a overhaul like Skyrim Redone, but is rather a comprehensive texture pack for Skyrim (like Skyrim HD or Serious HD, but with an aim towards vanilla friendliness and realism)

Without a doubt, this is one of, if not outright, the best texture packs ever released for Skyrim. It used to be on the Nexus, but a complicated situation caused it to be taken down. These are sized at 2048k, for better quality, but may cause VRAM overload when used with other textures (eg: following the STEP project). The 1k torrent is recommended if you have a low amount of VRAM - alternatively, use DDSopt (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/5755/?) to resize the normals to 1024k for minimal loss of quality.

Both the extra Dawnguard textures and the 1.6 update are included in this torrent. The 4k mountains optional is not included for now (and I may not include it - 2k is usually the limit texture-wise)

Installation: just add the files manually in your favorite mod manager and activate them. Obviously, you need Skyrim installed first.

Enjoy!
