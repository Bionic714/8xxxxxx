Downforce features arcade-style F1 racing in the future. In Tag mode you'll have to overtake your opponent and keep your lead for a certain amount of time to win the race. The game features at least seven courses, excellent graphics and realistic crash physics, even though the gameplay itself is much more arcade than your usual F1 simulation.
 
This is a PS2 only game that emulates very well on PC. Use PCSX2 v 1.0 (Included) to play this fun racing game. Check out the pictures in the "Working Config" folder, and read the README text file.

If you've never used PCSX2 before, don't worry, everything you need is included along with the very simple instructions to get it working.
