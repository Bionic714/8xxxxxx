Los Bros. Hernandez - Gilbert, Jaime, Mario

To a very great extent, Love and Rockets is synonymous with Hoppers' Maggie & Hopey and Palomar's Luba & Carmen & Heraclio & Tonantzin... but there was always more to L&R than that. Amor Y Cohetes finally collects together in one convenient package all the non-Maggie and non-Palomar stories by all three Hernandez Brothers from that classic first, 50-issue Love and Rockets series ΓÇö a dizzying array of styles and approaches that re-confirms these groundbreaking cartoonists' place in the history of comics.

The book leads off with Gilbert's original 40-page sci-fi epic ΓÇ£BEMΓÇ¥ from 1981's very first issue of Love and Rockets, featuring a very different Luba and a much looser, Heavy Metal- and Marvel Comics-inspired way of storytelling.

Other stories include Jaime's charming ΓÇ£Rocky and FumbleΓÇ¥ series starring a planet-hopping girl and her robot; stunning one-shots such as Gilbert's Frida Kahlo biography ΓÇ£FridaΓÇ¥ and his shocking autobiographical fantasia ΓÇ£My Love BookΓÇ¥; MarioΓÇÖs genre thrillers which take place ΓÇ£Somewhere in CaliforniaΓÇ¥; Gilbert's brutally dystopian ΓÇ£Errata StigmataΓÇ¥ stories; the playful ΓÇ£Hernandez Satyricon,ΓÇ¥ with Gilbert drawing Jaime's characters, and ΓÇ£War Paint,ΓÇ¥ with Jaime trying out Palomar; Gilbert's light-hearted ΓÇ£Music for MonstersΓÇ¥ starring Bang and Inez; and even a fantastical ΓÇ£non-continuityΓÇ¥ Maggie and Hopey story ΓÇ£Easter HuntΓÇ¥ by Jaime that didnΓÇÖt fit into the other books.

Amor Y Cohetes, the seventh (and concluding, for now) volume in the new ΓÇ£Complete Love and RocketsΓÇ¥ shows a very different side of Los Bros Hernandez.
