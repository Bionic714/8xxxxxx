The governement want to shut up us, but we will not step back !!!!!

We are tired of live in a country of corrupt politics, we have no hospitals, no
public transportation, no education, no security, no justice, no home, no food, and at other side we have the biggest tax in the world.

We need help from our friends from another countries to unmask this lier and dictatorship
governement !!!!!! Brazilian press lie and try to delegitimize our cause !!!


Governement use the militar police against us, a police from 1964 dictatorship !!!

This police is brutal and have gunshot a lot of people whit rubber ammunition, unjuried a lot of people and the press,
 and even use real ammunition, they beat in people, use Lacrimator and pepper gas. This is the same police of will welcome you 
in the World Cup 2014. 

We are tired of injustice. 

We wil resist !!! We are strong !!! But we will not win if we stay alone. 

This is a scream, a scream begging for Help !
