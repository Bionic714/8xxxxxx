Uniform officers and detectives from Sun Hill police station enforce law and order on a day to day basis.

From petty thieves to violent drug dealers, life is never easy for the members of the Metropolitan Police Force.
i recorded this from my satellite for a neighbour as i could not find it anywhere on the internet, it was ended around 2010 but is still shown on tv as repeats, if enough people are interested i will upload more as i have around 100 episodes at the moment, i don't know what season it is starting from i just recorded it from where it was shown, maybe an episode or two are missing again not my fault, if you like it please say so so i will know if it is worth my uploading anymore.
