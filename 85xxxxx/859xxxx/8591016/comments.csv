,Jailing,2013-06-19T13:33Z,~Sigh~ When will people realize anything Pirated will never work online (Unless Private Servers for certain games that are possible) I guess it is amusing to watch at the very least.

,cgw731,2013-06-19T20:03Z,This doesn't work
,rafa_mx,2013-06-19T20:22Z,"Can't seem to make it work. I already copied the three files on the Crack folder to C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommon, double click on the icon and nothing happens. Am I missing something?"
,rafa_mx,2013-06-19T20:24Z,"I can't seem to make it work. After I installed it, I copied the three files on the Crack folder to C:Program FilesSteamsteamappscommon, double click on the icon and nothing happens. I am doing something wrong?"
,Silvak,2013-06-19T23:32Z,"Thanks!

Fun but really hard game."
,akaunt,2013-06-20T01:19Z,Is it hard to play single player? or are there any ai players maybe?
,DiggerNicks69,2013-06-20T07:20Z,"This isn't working for me either. The screen goes black, crashes, and create a crashdump file."
,joonkp1976,2013-06-20T07:40Z,"here is steam work around the windows defender lesson for all of you who need it.  first de-activate your windows defender when you download and install a game downloaded off of a torrent.  do NOT delete the install files and also if the torrent is a install-less, then make a zip file of the downloads as a back up.  then after install or making zip back up, activate the windows defender.  run the game and the windows defender message will show.  now goto windows defender history tab and select the top of the three choices and click show history.  go and select the list and check the file name, folder.  next de-activate the windows defender, re-install or unzip the zip back up, then goto settings tab of windows defender and then set that file to exceptions list.  turn back on the windows defender and you are good to go.  steam games are usually the steam_api.dll that needs this done.  thanks for reading and hope this helps you helpless computer junkies who aer never sober to figure this out.  enjoy good gaming~!"
,ishmob,2013-06-20T23:34Z,if you get the error message msvcp110.dll is missing goto http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30679 and download it.vsu1vcredist_x64.exe is for laptops and vsu1vcredist_x86.exe is for desktop.Also add the ManaGame file to your exceptions in your Antivirus program if you get a black screen or it freezes at the Capcom screen.
,joonkp1976,2013-06-21T08:15Z,"I said steam work around but other games work the way I said around as well...  sorry about misinforming you, peeps~!"
,akaunt,2013-06-21T17:37Z,"Hmm.. this is crappy i tried 3 different torrents including this one, just getting crash dump... tried almost everything from visual studio install to some custom crash fixes on the net.. nothing, just crash dump again, game wont even start. I guess thats my os fault.. or something"
,genostar10,2013-06-21T20:02Z,"Like akaunt, I've tried 3 different torrents and the Visual Studio installation but to no avail. Every time I try to open the game, nothing happens. The process appears in my Task Manager for a split second and instantly disappears. The game creates a crash dump file in the application's directory. I've tried running it as administrator, in compatibility to other Windows OS(s), and moving the files to different directories. Anyone know of a way to fix this? "
,genostar10,2013-06-21T20:04Z,"^And yes, I did copy the cracked files over for each installation, and yes I did completely uninstall the game before trying other torrents. :)"
,akaunt,2013-06-21T23:46Z,all of that man.. but ill try again!
,akaunt,2013-06-21T23:48Z,^ exactly... but you know what ill try again!
