,hoppyharrington,2013-06-19T14:02Z,"Yes moar111, I know that cassette tape well.

Perhaps the most legendary and sought after item that has ever existed in all of Dukedom.

The holy grail, if you will, of Ellingtonia.

Unfortunately, my ex-wife and her lawyer lover, swindled me out of my copy in the divorce settlement and I cannot share it with you. 

Oh the woes of the cuckholded male!!!"

,moar111,2013-06-20T06:51Z,"hi hoppyharrington,

yes your right the ""H"" is silent,but are our minds?.

mmm,i never knew the recording was held in such high esteem,i found a copy in cassette form in a charity shop years ago,and even then knowing very little about the duke I knew i was listening to something special,its only now in retrospect after listening to tons of other versions of the same songs that I can understand the brilliance of those particular versions..maybe I could transfer it into mp3 and upload it myself for the greater community?any advice about how to do this would be great....

shame on your ex-wife taking your copy,some things are simply sacred!,

have a good day hoppy,"

mmm,i never knew the dejavu recording was held in such high regard in the ellingtonian world.
I found the cassette years ago in a charity shop before I really knew what I was listening to,i mean I knew I liked the sound and thought it was simply brilliant to my young ears and its only now in retrospect after listening to all the much earlier versions of those songs that I understand the perfection and refinement that's taken place over years of playing and tweaking of those particular dejavu versions.

as you said, the holy grail!..sums it up perfectly..

I still have the cassette but have no idea on the best way to get a digital copy or even how to upload it..any advice with this would be great..

shame on your ex wife!,some things are simply sacred!....

have a good day hoppy...."
