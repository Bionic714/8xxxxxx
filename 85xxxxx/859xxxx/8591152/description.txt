This season was not released on DVD so I had to do a high quality webrip of this from Hulu and fix the video up alot. It turned out very good and looks as if it was ripped from official DVD's pretty much.

Encoded the entire Season 1 Arc 2 or Season 2 (Whatever you wanna call it) of Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal which is Episodes 25-49 into high quality MKV h.264 format with English audio. 

Now you can enjoy this show in an amazing quality. I think this turned out great and looks very good.

Standard Definition Season 1 Arc 2 can be found in my uploads as well

Like the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! GX? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads
Like Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's? I encoded it as well and it can be found in my uploads

For playback all you need is the proper codec if you dont already have it. 
Combined Community Codec Pack (which I prefer) or the K-Lite Codec pack should give you all you need and more to play these back.

You should be able to hear audio just fine if you have one of the mentioned codec packs above. If you cannot hear any audio and do not want to install a codec pack for some reason, then you do not have and need the nero aac audio codec. As of today it can be found here.
