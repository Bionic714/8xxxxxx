   1. Fixed a bug in recovery record generation in RAR 5.0 archive format.

      Under certain circumstances previous beta versions could produce
      wrong recovery record data, inefficient to repair a corrupt archive.
      Such invalid recovery record can be identified with ""Test"" command,
      which issues ""Recovery record is corrupt"" warning for it."
