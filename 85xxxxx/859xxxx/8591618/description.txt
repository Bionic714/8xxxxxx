About the game:

Oblivion is a role-playing game (RPG) that incorporates open-ended gameplay.
The player can follow side-quests, interact with NPCs, dispatch monsters, develop their character, and travel anywhere in the realm of Cyrodiil at any time while playing the game.
At the beginning of the game, the player selects one of many human or anthropomorphic races, each of which has different natural abilities, and customizes their character's appearance.
The story begins with the player imprisoned in a cell for an unnamed crime and the arrival of Emperor Uriel Septim VII, accompanied by Imperial bodyguards known as "the Blades" at the Imperial City prison. 
They are fleeing from the assassins of the Mythic Dawn, a Daedric cult, who have murdered the Emperor's three sons. 
The bodyguards opt to kill the player but the Emperor prevents them because he had seen the player in a dream. 
The Emperor, the Blades, and the player head to a sewer that leads out of the city, using a secret entrance that is located in the player's cell. 
Once in the sewer, the group is attacked by the Mythic Dawn. Uriel Septim entrusts the player with the Amulet of Kings, worn by the Septim emperors of Tamriel, and orders the player to take it to a man named Jauffre, who is the grand master of the Blades. 
Immediately afterward one of the assassins kills the Emperor. 
The player then proceeds to the open world of Cyrodiil....
