,Johnlee206seattle,2013-06-20T03:28Z,hows the quality? including sound?
,DerSpiegel64,2013-06-20T06:02Z,Just a warning that it is Cinavia protected should you try to watch it through your PS3.
,oreo8957,2013-06-20T16:48Z,FINALLY SOMEONE WHO UPLOADS A VERY GOOD CAM...THE SCULLS THAT UPLOAD MOVIES HERE COULD/SHOULDTAKE A LESSON FROM YOU...GREAT JOB 
,THRobinson,2013-06-21T05:09Z,"Seems really dark. Skipped through and every scene I stopped at was very dark and lacking detail. Probably decent for being a TS/Cam but, think I'll just wait for bluray instead."
,Ssgtmcnasty,2013-06-21T08:15Z,Can I assume this is not the same garbage shake-a-thon taken by the NOOB who cant stop fiddling with the camera and doesnt know how to turn OFF the damn autofocus? If so....props.
,mtbno1,2013-06-22T15:25Z,"No Great Copy not shaky  bit dark in sections of nighttime shots etc but good quality ;) thanks again

Please note:

   I got a copyright infringment notice from downloading this thanks for the upload but i think its being watched ( hadn't downloaded anything in months and DL'd this and next day got the infringment warning )   "
