Intended for Blu-Ray players effected by Cinavia.
The soft subs however are for players like VLC & PotPlayer.

I enjoy watching on my Blu-Ray player, but it doesn't do external subs very well & I'm guessing I'm not alone in that department. So here it is English Hardcoded, where there is non English dialogue. Optional custom English soft subs for the entire film (Spanish & Dutch too). Also in reguards to watching on Blu-Ray players, this film is effected by Cinavia on the Blu-Ray release, but the DVD is not effected.


A struggling screenwriter ('Colin Farrell' ) inadvertently becomes entangled in the Los Angeles criminal underworld after his oddball friends (Christopher Walken and Sam Rockwell) kidnap a gangster's (Woody Harrelson) beloved Shih Tzu. Rated R
