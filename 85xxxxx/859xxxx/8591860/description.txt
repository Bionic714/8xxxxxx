LibreOffice 4.0.4 Final (32 bit) - SceneDL

LibreOffice is a productivity suite that is compatible with other major office suites and available on a variety of platforms. It is free software and therefore free to download, use and distribute. The goal is to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF support and without any copyright assignment requirements. LibreOffice is capable of performing the same tasks as every other office suite, from making calculations to drawing.

Changelog :

LibreOffice 4.0.4 Final (2013-06-19)

This is the fifth release from the 4.0 branch of LibreOffice.
LibreOffice 4.0.4 is suitable for all users; for extra-conservative requirements, we refer you to LibreOffice 3.6.6 from the previous series.

The following notes apply:

This release is bit-for-bit identical to the 4.0.4 Release Candidate 2, so you don't need to download or reinstall if you have that version already.
The distribution for Windows is an international build, so you can choose the user interface language that you prefer. Help content is available via an online service, or alternatively as a separate install.
Our Windows binaries are digitally signed by The Document Foundation.
For Windows users that have OpenOffice.org installed, we advise uninstalling that beforehand, because it registers the same file type associations.
If you run Linux, the GCJ Java variant has known issues with LibreOffice, we advise to e.g. use OpenJDK instead.
LibreOffice 4.x drops a few long-deprecated features, including support for legacy binary StarOffice files, export to legacy Word and Excel (version 6.0/95), and legacy ODMA document management.
Some menu entries have changed or added. If you miss something, that may be due to the use of customised menu settings from your previous LibreOffice installation.
This version still contains a few annoying bugs, as listed here. Specifically, the German Duden Korrektor extension needs a manual fix.
