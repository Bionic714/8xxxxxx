,hoppyharrington,2013-06-19T17:24Z,"Upon further reflection, my dedication seems too ambiguous.

I was thinking about ""what a fool you've been"".

Also think of ""brag about all the harm you've done"" as an allusion to the drone strikes, night raids, assassinations, humanitarian bombings, etc.

 I'm trying to keep things simple here.

I can't help it, this CD always makes me contemplate Obama and the thought processes of his hapless supporters.

Obama has kind of ruined this CD for me."
