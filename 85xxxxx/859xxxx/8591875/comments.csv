[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-19T18:09Z,"a marvel person lied? nooooooooo way Ahlat.  ;-)

it's interesting that the lower-quality leaked scan included the ad for angela's upcoming appearance in guardians of the galaxy, but this digital webrip doesn't... i'm sure there's no problem, but that's odd."

At least this one leads into something, so there's that. Really looking forward to Infinity as Hickman is the writer on that project and he's not anti-climatic with his storytelling."
,Ahlat,2013-06-19T19:02Z,"Well this one has an ad for Avengers A.I. So technically Bendis was telling the truth, there was a page missing!!!"
,opmed1,2013-06-20T04:28Z,"im shocked nobody has put up invinvible, or the recent invincible universe. If I could make a request that be it.  Ty for all your work regardless"
,tdurden83,2013-06-20T06:24Z,that final panel showing the whole marvel universe jumping over that shark was awesome!! bring on infinity.
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T16:46Z,"lmao tdurden83 if they could sell a ""brady bunch destroys the marvel universe"", they would, wouldn't they?  ;-)

opmed1 invincible universe 3 was posted last week in http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8567807/"
,tdurden83,2013-06-21T01:10Z,oh for sure they would. I can already see the brady kids all running around in future foundation get-ups
