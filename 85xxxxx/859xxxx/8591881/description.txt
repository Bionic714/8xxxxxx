Memories have a way of following you around and as I look back, I remember the fall of '66 as the beginning of my long and close friendship with Jackson Browne. I had just returned from Vietnam in August and went to the Paradox in Tustin, CA, where a bunch of us folkies and singer/songwriters would get together for an open mic. Jack was there. It was early evening and we went out back behind the club and shared a smoke together. I remember walking down the dark alley next to Jack and looking up at the neon blue sky with an early silver moon riding high and thinking "this is good." - Penny Nichols

The CD includes renditions of 12 favorite Jackson Browne songs from one of his oldest friends accompanied by many who have sung and played with Jackson over the years.
