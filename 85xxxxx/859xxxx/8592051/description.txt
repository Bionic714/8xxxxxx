Varmints is a sweet if laboured animated short based on the Helen Ward and Marc Craste book of the same name. It is a rather familiar story about the power and persistence of nature and the destructive impact of industrialisation. In truth it is a theme that many stories have covered before and whilst Varmints is certainly well made with some striking imagery it really adds very little new to the discussion. Having enjoyed the picture book I was actually a little underwhelmed by this adaptation which only seemed to stretch out and dwell on its already predictable message.

Still, the film is beautifully animated and captures the unique art direction of the picture book. Obviously as the film is directed by the book’s illustrator, Marc Craste, you’d expect a faithful adaptation and it is interesting to see his vivid designs brought to life. I particularly liked the nameless protagonist with its charming grunts and purrs conveying more than dialogue ever could. Jóhann Jóhannsson’s orchestral score is also a joy and perfect accompaniment even if I had expected something a little less conventional from the great Icelandic composer. Although inferior to its source material and overly familiar thematically, Varmints is still an accomplished short film that is often touching and filled with several sequences that will live long in the memory.
