matteo scalera? big shoes to fill...

thanks mirrormaster82!"
[V],mirrormaster82,2013-06-19T18:30Z,You're welcome STF.Didn't read this series after issue 4 so I'm kinda in the dark...
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-19T19:36Z,"well, it's pretty simple. bruce works for shield. shield uses hulk as a riot weapon. bruce enjoys pissing off maria hill. this issue is very good. scalera's art isn't great but it's pretty good.

fun series! highly recommend it."
