For many dubstep fans, Mt. Eden was the gateway into the wonderful world of 140bpm bliss. Tracks like ΓÇ£Sierra LeoneΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Beautiful LiesΓÇ¥ captivated many an aspiring bass head back in 2009. Four years later, the New Zealand duo of Jesse and Harley are still plugging along, this time around with a seven track EP signed to Ultra Records. 


Walking On Air is as delicate as its name implies. The EP is pervaded by airy, atmospheric soundscapes of caressing strings and melting pads. ΓÇ£Airwalker,ΓÇ¥ the EPΓÇÖs lead single featuring Diva Ice, is arguably its strongest output, however the re-imagining of ΓÇ£Sierra LeoneΓÇ¥ is sure to conjure some pleasant nostalgia. ΓÇ£ChasingΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£FlipmodeΓÇ¥ donΓÇÖt quite achieve the effect of their vocal-driven counterpart, but ΓÇ£DriveΓÇ¥ and ΓÇ£Lights Still OnΓÇ¥ help round out the EP as two compelling instrumental tracks of a more experimental nature. Ultimately, Walking On Air is an enticing selection of new material from a duo many still hold fond in their recent memory.
