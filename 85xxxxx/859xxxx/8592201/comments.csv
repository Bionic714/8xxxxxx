The whole screen isn't in view most of the movie, but the sound is good, and the movie is watchable, although a bit dark and blurry in some scenes.  To be expected though I suppose.  There is quite a bit of noise from him fiddling with the camera, then heaps of audience noise the last 20mins or so.  Clapping, laughing, talking loudly.
Like I said, it's annoying, but watchable."
