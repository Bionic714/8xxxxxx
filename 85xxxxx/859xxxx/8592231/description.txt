What you will learn
In this set of tutorials you will learn techniques for transferring character animation, created from a custom rig, between Maya and 3ds Max without sacrificing control over your rigs.

We'll first start by learning about the Send To feature that creates a bridge between the two software. We'll then cover how to setup objects to track the animation we'd like to transfer, and then, how regain control over our rigs so that we have the liberty to change the animation if needed.

We'll also cover troubleshooting techniques to make sure that everything is transferred properly to and from 3ds Max and Maya. By the end, you'll learn techniques for exporting animation that can help you save a lot of time!
