[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-19T22:59Z,"no, not really! ... it's pretty complicated ... you can read that link i put in the description -- it does contain spoilers for all 9 TV seasons and the 2 movies, but it's pretty useful.

this comic is less complicated if you know that 2 ex-agents of the FBI are hiding out under fake identities..."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T00:29Z,"you're welcome. yeah, as a fan of the series from episode 1, i liked it, too."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-20T02:13Z,"...HAW! Dream on! Some of us are still waiting for not only ""Alien Nation"" season 22, we're waiting for the reboot series that's been on the back burner since Bonnie ""Bleeding Cunt"" Hamner was running Sci-Fi!

Of course, there *are* some people who want a second season of ""I Married Dora"" just so they can watch the last show of the season end with ""Oh my God! We've been *Cancelled!!*"" again :) :) :)"
,shonuffx,2013-06-20T02:53Z,"Thanks man! Are there any prior X-Files comics worthwhile checking out?

Call me a monomaniac, but I feel as if in a tv void. No show has been able to get me my fix as those jewels of the '90's did. The X-Files, Outer Limits, Space Above and Beyond, Babylon 5, The Star Treks...Resorting to reading! Sure House M.D. and Lie to Me were great, but I can't recall other shows in the past decade that were as compelling as these from my pov. I didn't like Lost, never jumped the Prison Break train and am appalled by how the Walking Dead has been transformed for tv. Anyway, new Futurama episodes as of today! ;)"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T03:35Z,"i'd say ""what is alien nation?"" to ChingaTuu, but he might track me down and make me drink spoiled milk!

^^that is a torrent of mine from several months ago, compiling the 2 x-files wildstorm miniseries.

the old topps comics x-files series was enjoyable, and featured art by charlie adlard. i collected them when they first came out, but i've never seen many scans of them. some of them are in the MTCDC torrent for the letter X."
,shonuffx,2013-06-20T11:44Z,"Yeah, Alien Nation. As Intriguing as it was it never really convinced me. Kind of boring. Maybe I was too young to really appreciate it back then. Thanks for the ""30_Days"" link STFmaryville. I found out about the series when it was already over and never had the motivation to track the series down one by one. "
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T14:47Z,you're welcome
,Stonesour102,2013-06-22T05:24Z,Can you get the House of gold and bones series? I can't find them anywhere. Thanks
