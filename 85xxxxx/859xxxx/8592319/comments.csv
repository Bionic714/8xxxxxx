,ClubQBall,2013-06-21T21:53Z,"I find it hilarious that an obviously uneducated (i.e., ""ignorant"", ""uncouth"", and ""rude"") individual such as ""m0ww0w"" has the unmitigated gall, audacity, and outright temerity to post such a comment.

However, there's a bug where the game wont go any further after killing an elite monster (or, some people reported, doing escort quests)."
