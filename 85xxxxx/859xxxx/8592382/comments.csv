,DeeSund,2013-06-20T14:32Z,"Bio.........I have been following ALL your uploads since the release of the very first metal hard-rock covers. I think you have an amazing library and I love following you.

I have one request, and that is your 7 torrents of 
""An hour of metal & hard rock videos"" If you can maybe seed 2, 3, 4 again ?? Or if anyone else reading this has that chance to seed I would be eternally grateful !
