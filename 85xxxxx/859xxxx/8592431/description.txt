Harry Edison - 1990 - Swing Summit

Trumpeter Harry "Sweets" Edison was 74 at the time of this live set, but he still sounds in pretty good form. He is teamed with fellow Basie veterans Buddy Tate (who splits his time almost evenly between tenor and his rarely heard clarinet) and tenor saxophonist Frank Wess, while the rhythm section (pianist Hugh Lawson, bassist Ray Drummond, and drummer Bobby Durham) swings in a Basie vein. The sextet plays five veteran standards and two original blues (Edison's familiar "Centerpiece" and Tate's "Blue Creek") and, although not quite essential, this is an excellent late-period recording by Edison, Tate, and Wess.
