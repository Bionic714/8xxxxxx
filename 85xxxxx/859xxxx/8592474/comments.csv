,ChingaTuu,2013-06-20T00:58Z,"...Agreed. Flooding the torrents like this is unacceptable, especially for material that the majority of us most likely have no interest in because we can't speak/read/wank off in Hindi.

Do us a favor: kill all these torrents, wrap the comics up in one nice big torrent, and don't alienate yourself further by being a dick about it"

Friend I got your Point...
Actually this one is not for You Mr. ChingaTuu this is only for the Hindi user ...
If you want an English Episode then I'll wrap up all the Episode in one torrent...
I made different torrent for all the Episode just because of user's ease...
means user only download those file that they want..."
