Howdy folks,

This is my second attempt (the first I shit the the bed) at uploading something (for legitimate backup reasons of course), so let's see if it works.

I was a little disappointed in the sound quality of the previous versions of Death Masks available. They sounded muffled or somehow distorted. so, I sacked up, purchased a copy of my very own and ripped it to the best of my ability.

The book is chapterized so feel free to dl just one and see if it's something you would be interested in (for using in your own digital backup of course).

I'll keep this seeded for at minimum a few weeks since I have nothing else to do.
