,Synval,2013-06-23T09:52Z,"Great upload as always.  I was wondering if I could ask your assistance.  I'm new to comics in general, and I have lists that I should get, but I'm very fuzzy on the order of them.  I heard there was a series called 52 before this?  Or is this new 52 a part of that.  Any information you could give me would be appreciated.  "
