Yeah, I also notice this later when I was playing the game.


On exiting game, ps3 gets into so deep freeze you got to hold turn off button for 7-8 sec or longer. Just hold turn off and it will shut down. Then turn it on again.



Got the eboot checked and I see there is no certificate loader function and no SSLs. Actualy, game eboot is structured with some new functions and calls I havent seen before.


This game exit shit is very annoying. I dont like it either, but game works fine besides that.


Gonna look some more and try to find what is causing this issue."

also rename the D&D (retro capcom games) install files or the PS3 wont recognize them.. it doesn't like the ""&"" symbol"
