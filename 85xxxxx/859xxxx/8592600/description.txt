Storyline: Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode star in this psychological thriller from Korean director Chan-Wook Park. Following her father Richard (Dermot Mulroney)'s death in an unexplained road accident, reclusive teenager India Stoker (Wasikowska) withdraws further into the quiet rural life she shares with her emotionally disturbed mother Evie (Kidman). But her curiosity is stirred when her mysterious uncle Charlie (Goode), who she has never met, suddenly arrives unannounced. Told that the darkly charismatic Charlie will now be staying at the house, India's initial well-founded distrust of her uncle's motivations begins to waver as she finds herself becoming ever more deeply entranced by his sinister charms.
