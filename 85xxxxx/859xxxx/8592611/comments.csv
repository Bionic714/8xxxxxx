Please update them"
,SM-003,2013-06-20T10:20Z,"There is only 2 new keys for windows 8 & only 1 new key for WMC....rest are repeated ...

@Halloweenpsycho-It seems you didn't take my suggestion seriously unlike your word we had in your former torrent"
,vile1313,2013-06-21T13:58Z,seriously everyone needs to chill out.. I have gotten this to work using unlock codes found here and in the unlocker... if you don't like HP's torrents go elsewhere.. all of his torrents work if you follow the damn instructions
,Surhumain,2013-06-21T17:52Z,How to get this on USB ? :)

Thanks mate. 
Guys i am sorry as i said i had a accident and my memory is a little off atm, if i gave you mostly the same serials i apologize. I am working on new ones, please just bear with me as i am in recovery for the head trauma i received and things may be a little sketchy for me. I have asked my wife to help me out in cross checking things as i complete them. I hope i will be back to normal soon, but as the doc says it may take some time to recover. I will do my best to always provide you the best. Take care "
,vile1313,2013-06-22T01:52Z,@HP hope you recover fast bro... hopefully everything is alright

Thank you so much. I hope so as well.:)
As for the serials provided in this release please ignore the Online activation as it no longer applies atm. I have checked each and every serial that i have provided and they are all still functional, and they have not been blocked as of yet. So i am confused as to why the bitching commenced about these serials. I work very hard for all of you to make sure that i am able to release new serials in a timely manner. I have been doing this for over 7 months now and i continue to support the torrents with new serials on a constant basis, as i will continue to do until everyone has had a chance to receive what they deserve , a proper legitimate permanent copy of windows 8. I spend a lot of hours trying to get new serials ready, not that i am  complaining because i enjoy providing for the community. I don't know how much simpler i can make the instructions on a successful activation and a successful back up. I also offer legit permanent copies of Office 2013 pro plus retail, both 32 and 64 bit with the same back up technique. I appreciate every single person that has supported my work, and i always try to offer help to those that need it which is not normal for many releases by other uploaders. But i want to make sure the ones that need help can get it. Anyway if you have a issue for some reason, instead of being upset with it just let me know what is going on and i will try to help you the best i can. Take care everyone Cheers."

Just get well soon....

& I ain't complaining anything except the repetition of the same keys) again & again. As i  told you earlier that I've been watching your work since the first day & very much appreciate your work as your are trying to help everyone by providing the keys in a regular updated manner with simple instructions (at least I don't have any problem with that), 

I can help you in this sorting matter as I've already prepared a doc (for myself of course) in which all of your serials are enlisted with due date of updation & other details. And as I told you earlier that I've checked & gone through each & every single key so that I can check the authenticity, so every piece of information is correct & up to date. 

Also I've done some modification in instructions as well to precise it.

If you want me to help you & contribute something for the sake of everyone else out there, drop me a email at 'soul.stoler@gmail.com'"
