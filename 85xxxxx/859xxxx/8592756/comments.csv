,Gusar19,2013-06-20T15:06Z,Thanks for upload  but somehow there is no seeders from yesterday. 
,candymancan,2013-06-21T00:08Z,"Np man, ppl tend to not seed due to fear of their isp. "
,Gusar19,2013-06-21T01:24Z,Torrent software seeding itself if it is open so we dont control unless we delete torrent.Other uploads have no issues with seeders.It seams only your uploads for some reasons have one seeder (you) and 200 lleechers?????
,candymancan,2013-06-21T09:42Z,If someone can comment as to if my troubleshooting worked.. I changed the upload speed on my utorrent settings. Plz reply..
