Grand Canyon Skywalk
Get exclusive access to the construction of a man-made marvel suspended over one of Mother Nature's greatest wonders a horseshoe-shaped, glass-floored bridge that allows visitors to walk where eagles fly. NGC takes viewers behind the daring design and death-defying construction of the Grand Canyon Skywalk, formed from 1 million pounds of steel and glass, perched 4,000 feet above the Colorado River.
Go where only the eagles dare to fly...welcome to the Grand Canyon Skywalk. Helicopters can take you through her many valleys. Buses can drive you by her many peaks. But only you can walk the sky. Imagine yourself suspended in air 4,000 feet over the majesty of the Grand Canyon ... view the glory of the Colorado River below, witness the sunrise over the canyon's carved peaks, and listen to the stillness of Mother Nature. The Skywalk at Grand Canyon West is a unique glass-bottomed cantilever observation deck that spans 70 feet over the canyon's rim. This internationally recognized architectural wonder is now one of the best day trip destinations from Las Vegas, NV and Northern Arizona.
