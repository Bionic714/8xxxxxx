 Akash (Kunchacko Boban) and Shibu (Biju Menon)
 are two jail birds who escape from a train    
 while they are being transported to a jail.   
 They end up in a village at the Kerala ΓÇô      
 Tamil Nadu border, where they are mistaken    
 for a pair of priests expected at the local   
 church. The duo masquerade as priests, and    
 reopen a church which has been closed for     
 years, thereby winning over the villagers.    
 A series of events that take place after      
 their arrival bring about a change in         
 their outlook towards life and society.
