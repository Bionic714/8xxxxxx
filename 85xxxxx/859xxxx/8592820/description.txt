 Akash (Kunchacko Boban) and Shibu (Biju Menon) 
 are two jail birds who escape from a train     
 while they are being transported to a jail.    
 They end up in a village at the Kerala ΓÇô       
 Tamil Nadu border, where they are mistaken     
 for a pair of priests expected at the local    
 church. The duo masquerade as priests, and     
 reopen a church which has been closed for      
 years, thereby winning over the villagers.     
 A series of events that take place after       
 their arrival bring about a change in          
 their outlook towards life and society.
