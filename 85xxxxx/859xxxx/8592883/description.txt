Animals have existed on Earth for many hundreds of millions of years. In that time they have evolved into a great variety of forms, exploiting nearly every habitat the planet has to offer. In the dark depths of the oceans, in the seemingly inhospitable Polar Regions, in the driest deserts, even within the bodies of other animals, there are animal species that have developed unique and extraordinary means of surviving and thriving. Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual AnimalSΓë¬/i&gt; is an exploration of those members of the animal kingdom who possess strange and bizarre adaptations that allow them to survive in the most extreme environments, or whose complex lives can only be said to be bewildering. From the tar-baby termite to the blue whale, from the harpy eagle to the naked mole rat, these species reflect the exceptionally broad spectrum of life, showing just how diverse the animal kingdom is.

Extraordinary AnimalSΓë¬/i&gt; has been thoroughly researched for scientific accuracy, but is accessibly written in everyday language.

Each entry includes a description of the animal, an explanation of its odd behavior, other interesting scientific and trivial facts, and black and white illustrations. In addition, a fun and interactive Go Look section encourages readers to go look for the animals in the outside world.
