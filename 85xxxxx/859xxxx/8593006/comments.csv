I tried downloading this file yesterday and it just sat there...how come you have so many leechers on your files, yet they are so small?  They shouldn't take more than a minute to download.  Someone enlighten me, or are you spoofing?"
,candymancan,2013-06-21T04:06Z,"no idea man, I tried downloading all my torrents and the ones with 1+ seeds worked fine. The only issue I can think of is that I have been having connectivity issues with my wifi, and perhaps that has messed with my seeding. "
,freight2,2013-06-22T00:37Z,Thanks for the response and the uploads.  At least you're trying :)
