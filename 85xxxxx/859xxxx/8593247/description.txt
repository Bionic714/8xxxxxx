Dan Mihai Balan (born February 6, 1979 in Chisinau, Moldavian SSR) is a Moldovan singer, songwriter, and producer. He has performed rock, and pop. One of the most successful part of his music career was when he was part of the eurodance music trio O-Zone, a group he led to fame across Europe with the hit single Dragostea din Tei.

In 2004, Balan decided to venture closer to his rock roots. He chose the best musicians in his region and moved with them to Los Angeles in 2005. Although Dan wrote the compositions prior to the formation of the band Balan, it took two years to get a signature sound and their own captivating style. He asked producer Jack Joseph Puig (John Mayer, Sheryl Crow, No Doubt, The Black Crows, Rolling Stones) to produce the record. The album was recorded in April/June 2006 at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles.
