First off, thank you for this, a lot of folks have been waiting to see what Katie looks like.  

That being said, you're going to have to come up with some better names for your uploads.  ""001"" isn't that great of an idea when you already used this for Virginia.  A lot of guys, (myself included) downloaded both of your uploads with that same name.  Now we have the fun of separating both girls.  Well, it COULD be worse, I guess.

How about in the future, you come up with something like ""New Fame Girls Virginia 001,"" or ""NFGV001?""

But again, thank you - nice upload!  "
,terrenmcconn,2013-06-20T17:57Z,"My bad - it was someone else who did this today, and I came back and blamed you for it.  My apologies!  

But thank you for ALSO uploading the new Fame Girls!  "
