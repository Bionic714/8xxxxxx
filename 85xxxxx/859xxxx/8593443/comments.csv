,mi.tom,2013-06-21T00:13Z,Lol has anybody noticed that Abigail Breslin looks like Kirsten Dunst?
,Ancient_Alchemist,2013-06-21T21:10Z,"This is not a complaint. I am grateful for all you put up. You may want to check your encoding standards though. Both Casino Royale and Quantum Solace had slight pixel problems. Troy and Gladiator didn't appear to have any. Those are the only ones I've watched from you so far. So I'm not sure if it is just the older uploads that have that problem, but just wanted to let you know. A lot of these movies I have and wanted to swap them for yours since you use the actual source and the quality is excellent. I would hate to have it all ruined for a few blips in quality. Yes I realize it's free, but I don't think that's an excuse not to report something. Obviously want to help you make sure you get the best quality possible and report problems."
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-22T00:45Z,"Many of the situations in which ""pixilation"" occurs is simply due to the source and resulting compression required...

It's a little frustrating I agree.... And my attempts to try and resolve those are a little fruitless without breaking support for millions of other devices by moving up to a higher standard of x264 encoding that WOULD resolve those small issues.

The only solution is to essentially BUMP the bitrate a fairly considerably amount to smooth out those frames in which the color banding does occur. Most of it usually during scenes that usually have a very soft black or grey/fog/dust shade to it.

Initially I had done several ""re-encodes"" hoping that a combination of settings would solve it. But the more I tweaked, the better those specific parts got but at the expense of the rest of the movie.

In all out frustration I went and downloaded a 3 other movies from 3 other encoders of the same film at various bitrates to see how they managed at those specific scenes. Suffice it to say, the only one that was pretty much rid of it was the 6GB version of the film. The rest all exhibited it either similarly or worse. Actually the one that was similar was a full GB larger than mine, the one that was worse was only a couple Hundred MB less.

The plan is to finish up my collection and then start focusing on 4k content.. soon. When I do 4k.. it's going to be considerably higher spec'd..."
,buenio,2013-06-22T04:08Z,"@dhjudasx what do you mean you will do 4k on the future??? What if our TV's are only FULL HD 1920 X 1080 and not supporting a 4096 X 2304 resolution, so we can't play your movies???"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-22T08:38Z,"we'll see... nothing is set in stone... but generally there is always a capability or method of making it work...

example being that 1080p work fine on a 720p tv too..."
,buenio,2013-06-22T13:14Z,"@dhjudasx i have 3 questions for your future 4k uploads. Please answer this 3 to make it clear to us.

1. We can play it on our Built in LED TV's Media Player???

2. You Will compress the 4k Resolution to 1080p Resolution???

3. In Your Opinion what is the maximum Size of this file (4k Movie) if necessary???"
[V],dhjudasx,2013-06-22T16:52Z,"to all 3...

not sure yet"
,buenio,2013-06-23T06:39Z,"@dhjudasx 1 more thing I have a feedback to your SKYFALL upload, my friend had 13GB 1080 DTS Full HD file copy of this film and I had yours and I compare it to my 55"" SONY Bravia and it's almost the same quality brother good job MR. JUDAS..."
