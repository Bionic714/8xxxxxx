[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-20T01:31Z,"The series is set in a vastly depopulated far-future Earth where numerous hunter-gatherer cultures, some human and some not, surround densely overpopulated domed city-states of recognizably modern urbanites functioning at a high technological level. Our own civilization and its considerably more advanced successors are lost to prehistory save for a few twentieth-century pop cultural artifacts conveniently recovered by well-paid psychics.

The cities, particularly the city state of Anvard, are dominated by wealthy and exclusive clans which self-select their members for physical and psychological homogeneity and head up a hierarchy of half-clan culls, clanless half-citizens, slaves, visiting nomads (some non-human), and genetic ""constructs"" with animal features. Large corporations and a decentralized infotrader/media network both wield considerable and at times quite nefarious influence. Office workers routinely jack in to virtual reality environments while walking the city as zombies.

The societies outside the domes endure less overt injustice but much more privation and danger. These include, but are not limited to, several aboriginal human cultures, an all-but-matriarchal civilization of lion-women, enigmatic raptor lizards with organs adapted specifically to brain surgery and genetic engineering, and cow-horned farmer-pirates harvesting enemy crops in giant militarized combines, and they are all constantly in low-grade conflict with each other for scarce resources."
