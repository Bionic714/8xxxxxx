Apologies for the do-over on this one - I just couldn't live with the name of the writer/artist so mangled in the title. Nothing about the folder or files changed, though, so when you start this torrent (in theory) it should just continue your previously started download (if the folder and files you started downloading previously are still in the same place, anyway).
