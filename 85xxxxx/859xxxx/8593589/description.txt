Ghita of Alizarr is a sword-and-sorcery comic book created by Frank Thorne after he ceased work on Marvel Comics' Red Sonja. The titular character, Ghita of Alizarr, is a barbarian warrior like Red Sonja. Like Sonja, Ghita's generally garbed in an armored bikini, but frequently less than that. The story maintains a classic erotic comic fantasy adventure theme, showcasing Thorne's talent for illustrating 'pinup-style' warrior women and detailed settings. Even with the sexual nature of many scenes, the series is generally considered erotic as opposed to pornographic.
