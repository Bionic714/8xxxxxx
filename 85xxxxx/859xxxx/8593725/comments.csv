thanks, but i wouldn't if it wasn't for scanners and uploaders like you. In my country quality comics and graphic novels aren't easily accessible, i'd have to import every single issue if it wasn't for the scanning community. So i thought, i profit so much, the least i can do is to make great material more convenient to obtain and store."
