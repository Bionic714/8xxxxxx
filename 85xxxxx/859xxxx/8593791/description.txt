TPB mods, contrary to the how it may appear when looking at that cover image, this book is in NO WAY pornographic. In fact, it barely qualifies as "Mature Readers" in the current world of more adult themed comic books.

'Sex and Violence'

PaperFilms, 2013, 66 pages

Written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti

Illustrated by Jimmy Broxton, Juan Santacruz, Challenging Studios

Words from a review by Kelly Cassidy at the Comic Booked website.

The first story, "Pornland, Oregon", tells the tale of a man avenging his family. His family has been wronged and he goes to any lengths to find those responsible. 

The second story, "Girl in a Storm", is a different beast entirely. This story focuses more on the sex aspect than the violence, although it is not devoid of the latter. It's also a story about humanity, but how our loneliness at times can truly cause us to search out our desires in ways that are not always considered "right".
