Who has Thomas Merton's another book the wisdom of the desert?
Upload it, please."
,Mertonoia,2013-06-20T19:40Z,"@ jiuyong I think you mean Wisdom of the Desert? I could have sworn pharmakate gave us that one but I don't find it in a search. @ pharmakate my apologies for this delayed response about Merton's talks. We suffered an extended power outage after a storm then lost our modem when power surged on the return. Concerning the audio files I'm learning how to post them with a Mac. Like you, bandwidth may be an issue. I rather hoped others might take over soon after I get each up."
,Mertonoia,2013-06-20T19:43Z,"@ pharmakate forgive me, I forgot to thank you for this and the biography today. I marvel at how you're able to consistently post so much exceptional material...how anyone could find the time to know what's good when s/he spends so much time scanning and sharing."
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-20T20:00Z,"No, I haven't posted Wisdom of the Desert yet (though I did a book with a similar title by Henri Nouwen). It's on my list, though, and eventually I hope to get to it.

@Mertonoia -- You're welcome, again. I've spent many years as a book-obsessive (I bet that's a disease in the new DSM-V), and now I happen to have an extended period of undesired free time, so I get to do something I've wanted to do since I learned about ebooks. Within a few months I'll have to slow way down though -- I need to start earning a living again.

Are those Merton talks the ones that used to be up on demonoid? They were just under 4 GB total. I think they might have even been here on tpb a few years ago. If you have bandwidth problems you might try breaking the bunch up into smaller chunks and uploading one a week or something.

Sorry to hear about the power outage -- but it reminds me I need to update my backups ..."
,nedand,2013-06-20T20:35Z,Thank you very much!
,Mertonoia,2013-06-21T03:46Z,"@pharmakate Yes, they are the same. I'm surprised to hear they were up here years ago as I helped the demonoid poster get them up. Perhaps he got them here. All I can say is that your loss is the world's gain. The good you're doing is inestimable as generations live with the wisdom gleaned from these titles, your special taste. Thanks for your suggestion about uploading, definitely doable. What's your sense of how long original posters are expected to seed their uploads?"
[T],pharmakate,2013-06-21T06:15Z,"Oh, so I bet YOU were the one on demonoid who asked several times HEY ANYONE HAVE ANY MORE MERTON?? I didn't forget that!

You just have to seed anything until it's established -- until there are enough seeders to keep it going. Usually that means seeding until utorrent shows a share ratio of maybe 3. But it all depends on how many people decide to stick around and keep seeding. For a big torrent I would imagine starting it before bed and allowing to seed overnight. By the next morning there should be plenty of seeders. As long as tpb shows 1 seeder apart from you, the torrent will live.

I was surprised how fast my torrents got seeded the first time I did this. The real problem is that they don't last forever -- you can see that many of mine are down to 1 or 2 seeds now. I keep the torrents are re-start them periodically, but eventually I'll just have too many to do that.

I recommend using a vpn/proxy service.

I hope my uploads help people as you say -- I especially like thinking people around the world who otherwise would never have access to the books can get them."
