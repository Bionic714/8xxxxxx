The latest Nina Quinn mystery is one of the best. Heather Webber does an excellent job bring to life the Gossip Mill and evolving the characters. Those who are already hooked on this series will not be disappointed. If you have not read any of the previous books, you could likely read this without feeling lost. I highly recommend this book and any others by Heather Webber.
