,binderguy1,2013-06-20T05:21Z,"It's surely nice to be an inspiration for others to ul!  ;-)

Always used to love reading Spy vs Spy back in the day.

Thanks for the ul, STFmaryville!"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T06:21Z,"technically, ultimate cloak & dagger lit the match. lol"
,tdurden83,2013-06-20T06:43Z,"thx man, followed the trail of comments here. I used to love those spy vs spy short cartoons, but I can't remember what show they were on. i'm sensing a google search in my immediate future."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T07:07Z,"i think ""Mad TV"" was the show. happy hunting! i'm off to bed."
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-20T07:21Z,"...You know you're old when you remember when ""Spy vs. Spy"" was a documentary strip and not a parody of the Cold War."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T13:15Z,"what is ""the Cold War""?"
,Silvak,2013-06-20T15:04Z,Any possibility of getting Invincible #103?
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T19:29Z,the amazing blackcanary says yes! http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8595482/
,tdurden83,2013-06-21T01:05Z,"I saw that it must've been mad tv when I checked out the wiki page last night, but I really thought I was a little younger than that would make me at the time. plus, I never cared for that show. if anyone remembers spy vs spy shorts on anything other than mad tv, i'd appreciate them posting about it. my guess is that i'm mistaken, but it's still nagging at me a little.  "
,new52,2013-06-21T04:29Z,"STFmaryville: Thanks for the up!

tdurden83: Aside from MADtv? Perhaps the commercials for Mountain Dew. "
,tdurden83,2013-06-21T22:22Z,"nah man, that was almost a decade later than when mad tv began even, but thx for trying to help. when i clicked the link to get to this torrent just now, it dawned on me that what little i did care about figuring this out is gone, so nvm"
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-22T02:54Z,"lol happens to me more and more now that i'm in my 30s for a few years. ""meh, i don't really care anymore...""  :-)"
,alienoar,2013-06-23T05:27Z,"word. always loved spy vs. spy, along with sergio aragones' marginal error dept. they were the most enjoyable part of mad mag. takes me back!

Thanks once again for the constant barrage of quality comics torrents STFmaryville. Keeping it real classy."
