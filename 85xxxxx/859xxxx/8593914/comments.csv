Because you're getting ""Dropped dialogue and a wildly varying volume level"" you have to call the uploader, who made an effort to share, a ""fucking moron"".

Learn to read, fucktard, or do you not know the difference between uploader and encoder? Next time keep your tiny-brained comments to yourself, cockgobbler."
