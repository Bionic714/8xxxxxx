.: Plot :.
When Fry, a somewhat dim-witted 25 year-old pizza delivery boy for Panucci's Pizza is asked to make a drop at Applied Cryogenics, it's the beginning of a journey that will take him more than a thousand years into the future.

Fry falls into one of the company's capsules and doesn't emerge until the dawn of the year 3000. Here he befriends a beautiful one-eyed alien called Leela (a worker at the New York based cryogenics factory) and a degenerate robot named Bender. The trio track down Fry's great-great-great-etc. nephew, Professor Farnsworth, who hires the three to work for his intergalactic delivery service. Together they traverse the cosmos delivering goods for Planet Express, Leela serves as the ship's captain and Bender indulges in his love of booze, large cigars and pornography.

It was recently announced that Futurama will be returning with 26 new episodes in 2010 on Comedy Central. The cable net has already re-signed voice stars Billy West, Katey Sagal and John DiMaggio to reprise their animated roles.
