,jalucian,2013-06-21T05:32Z,"I looked for a 1080 or 720 source shortly after it was released on blu-ray and couldn't find one, but I'll look again. If I find one, I'll definitely do it since I've already done several other Tinto Brass films: Trasgredire (Cheeky), All Ladies Do It, and Monamour."
,jalucian,2013-06-22T00:19Z,"Checked again, still no HD sources as of yesterday, but I'll keep looking periodically."
,dalesteyn,2013-06-22T21:56Z,"Idk if you noticed or not but HighCode uploaded 1080p version of this one,slightly large though 
(~14.5GB)
now as you've uploaded this movie with increased bitrate i personally don't think i need a 1080p encode(this one is good enough)
Just letting you know in case you wanna UP a 1080p version...
thnx anyway... :)
Good Movie.."
