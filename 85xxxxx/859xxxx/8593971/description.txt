Notes:

Another addition to my controversial film encodes, starring James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal, containing a bit of a D/s theme.

Bitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.

Please seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.
