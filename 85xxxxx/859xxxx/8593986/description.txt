What does Johnny Boo do when there's nothing to do? Johnny Boo Does Something! In fact, he does a LOT of things!

Watch Johnny Boo have a Boring Adventure and discover Yawn Power, write an angry letter to Ice Cream Magazine, get a squiggly new hairdo, fall to the bottom of Ice Cream Hole #25, and celebrate the maybe-birthday of his pet ghost Squiggle, all adding up to the most inventive Johnny Boo book yet.
