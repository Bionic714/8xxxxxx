I could not find a copy of this book. My copy is torn and the pages are turning yellow. The last Published date was 1968, to lose this would be a crime against Chess literacy.
I did my best to convert the book to its' actual copy.
The format is in PDF, so that you can do whatever you wish with it.
PLEASE do not complain about typo or format errors, like I said I did my best.
There are some great chess matches in the Hastings Tornament, which came right after the London 1922 tournament.
So, get your chess board out and enjoy.
