Retrofit Comics/Top Shelf Productions, 2011, 36 pages

Written and Illustrated by James Kochalka

This swampy delight bundles together two hilarious 16-page stories from the unstoppable creative mind of James Kochalka! First, two "Rotten Little Cuties" search for a killer party and debate the meaning of life, then a pair of moss mounds claim to have invented "Facebook", and get very confused when trying to explain what that means. Saddle up your spores and don't miss the fun of Fungus!
