,TD0607,2013-06-20T10:04Z,"This is last weeks episode, right?"
,REALBasementBeatz,2013-06-20T13:26Z,"THIS IS NOT EPISODE 12.. ITS 11, WTF! ahhh. haha. o well.. ill wait longer.."
,optikus165,2013-06-20T18:02Z,It is ep12 and it did come out last week.
,geertweggen,2013-06-20T18:06Z,appreciated
,DrBimle,2013-06-20T21:25Z,"This is episode 11, last week's episode. Not the season finale, not episode 12."
,DrBimle,2013-06-20T21:29Z,"optikus165: according to what/who?

The ooficial website has this as ""ep 111: Releves"", and tv.com has it as episode 11 as well. 

Anyway, if you're expecting the season finale episode ""Savoureux"", episode 12 according to official sources, don't get this one, it's last week's. "
,sharpshot94549,2013-06-20T22:36Z,"the reason for the misunderstandings on ep. numbers is that here on the internet, we have the original episode 4 that was pulled from broadcast, so from 4 on the numbers are off by one"
,bobalazs,2013-06-21T00:52Z,so where's last episode?
,hiyane,2013-06-21T01:44Z,"i had to log in just to comment here.. was also looking for the season finale, but realized it doesnt air before 04:00 tonight :P
Latest Episode: Jun/13/2013 01x12 Releves

,RefOrMe,2013-06-21T04:49Z,Are we all confused?     http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/episodes?year=2013&ref_=tt_eps_yr_2013
,REALBasementBeatz,2013-06-21T06:41Z,"well no matter what everyone says.. this is not new, and its not the finale.. its a repeat of last weeks episode and its titled episode 12.. and last week was titles episode 11.. they are the same.. so..dont try to justify someones mistaken upload.. its cool.. but its not new.. or right. So.. if you saw episode 11. this is the same shit."
