,supkids,2013-06-20T07:17Z,Hell yeah! been looking forward to this for weeks. thanks!
,ChingaTuu,2013-06-20T07:17Z,"...Golly. Vampires vs Zombies. Lessee, the sequel will have the Vampires using Dr. Frankenstein(*) to create a cannon fodder army of Resurrected Stitched-Together-From-Parts soldiers all looking like Herman Munster to battle the Zombies. Then the Black Lagoon Creatures will get involved when the Zombies invade the oceans, and the Invisible Men will have their own problems because when the Zombies eat them, *they* become invisible. And to top it all off, not only will all the Universal monsters have problems when the Zombies accidentally release 100 million gallons of Dr. Hyde's formula into the waters off of Whitechapel - proving that Homeopathy is real! - out of the nuclear irradiated wastes of the Trinity Ground Zero come a colony of Giant Ants.

Every Giant Ant being a Zombie.

""Coming up next: Carnivorous Tribbles - a feeble plot device, or the latest in Zombie manifestations?""

,soletar,2013-06-20T17:52Z,"Thanks a lot STFmaryville. In just a few conversations, you gave me EVERYTHING on Black Panther ...except a real movie starring Djimonu Hounsou..LOL.

I am so happy you remembered the Marvel Knight Videos... i actually prefer videos because i believe it takes less effort to finish than reading. Once again THANKS. You are awesome!


By the way, were has the "" + / - "" button gone to? at times i wish to thumbs you up, but alas, i cant seem to find it."
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-20T19:28Z,"the pirate bay took it away, a few months ago. your thanks is good enough! enjoy them."
,tdurden83,2013-06-21T00:54Z,thx for the ul. I was excited until I saw the word vampires while skimming the comments. I'll still check it out with an open though
[V],STFmaryville,2013-06-22T00:27Z,"you're welcome. i'm not very impressed but it has potential. and avatar definitely needs some hits if it ever wants to climb out of ""niche publisher"" status."
