The Greatest American Hero Season 2 and 3 xvid (Enhanced+AudioFixed)

I found some webrips and replaced some of the other sources
available on the web torrents.. some claiming where DVDrips
of these seasons werent. (maybe they meant they recorded the tapes
to DVD-rs then ripped them to avis with window media audio :)

I took the Tvrips VHS tape rips and scaled them to 480p ranges

fixed the left channel only audio and added some sharpening

sync-ed the audio so seemed correct in Media Player Classic

using the latest Shark007 codecs fro windows 7e

they are now Xvids with Mp3 cbr 128 Audio. 1000Bitrate (no more wma9)

also header optimized for Smart tv playback without transcoding
so should work find on sony tvs and samsungs.

I did my best with them.. dont download if you expect HD quality
or wanting MP4_mkv formats 

Info- The series follows a FBI detective and a High School Teacher
who are given powers to fight crime after a UFO encounter


ENJOY and HELP SEED!

Note! I will be pausing the torrent for the next 7 HOURS
though first i want to see how many want it. 
also I have no new data to share this until then so be PATIENT

try not to limit your upload speed below 100kb/s else it will take longer
for you and everyone as I will have limited data to share this and also
limit speed

its BIG 14gb after ALL ! it will take days to seed out! cheers
