It was supposed to air last week."
,Goldfire1986,2013-06-22T08:21Z,"This was a very meh episode. The tightrope walker (forgot his name) had no relevance to the episode.

They didn't even tackle any myth either. Something along the lines of, ""is it possible to tightrope walk across the Grand Canyon with only duct tape rope"" could have worked."
