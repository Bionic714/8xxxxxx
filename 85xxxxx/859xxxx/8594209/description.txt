Global Capitalism Monthly Update -Richard D Wolff -June 2013-mp4 ptc


These Tuesday evenings begin with updates and analyses of major economic events during the last month. We focus especially on the ongoing global capitalist economic crisis, government responses, and how they are changing and challenging contemporary capitalism. We examine resistances to "austerity," "deficit reduction" and other similar programs that try to shift the costs of capitalist crisis onto the general population.



Actual economic developments and the alternative theoretical and analytical options for understanding them are central to these presentations. When time permits, there are general discussions open to all on the developments of the US and world economies and especially their political implications. We aim to develop all participantsΓÇÖ understanding and their ability to explain how economies are changing to others.
