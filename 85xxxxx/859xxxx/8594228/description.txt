Written and Illustrated by James Kochalka

Welcome to James Kochalka's award-winning, influential, and totally addictive autobiography, American Elf! It's a simple idea - every day, James draws a comic strip capturing a moment from his life - but gathered all together, these moments take on rich new meanings. Both silly and profound, American Elf is a portrait of human life lived to the fullest, infused with the trademark passion and magic of Vermont's Cartoonist Laureate.
