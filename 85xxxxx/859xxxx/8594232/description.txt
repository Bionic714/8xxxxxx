group notes...: Dear nuke-net participants,

                we ask you honestly to stop nuking for an invalid
                reason, above all if you do not even know any member
                of our group to prove if its valid or not. May you feel
                confused if a grp does not release that much most others
                do. Especially if its has serveed a couple of sections
                like we did in the past. But now we want to satisfy our needs
                by figuring the folliwing out clearly:
                We did not steal this group name.
                Sure we did not do much since 2005, but we are going to kick
                start our group again. So thats is not a valid reason to ban
                us from releasing.

                Thanks a lot for appreciation.

                Team DEFA
