,naiceface,2013-06-20T16:47Z,After performing all the instructions it say Illustrator CC Tryout...is that ok or I should reinstall (already did that). Thanks!
,THEVAN3D,2013-06-20T18:08Z,it stays in TRYOUT mode. apparently the amtlib.dll does not work. i had to paste the photoshop cc amtblib.dll here instead of illustrator one. hope it works for you too.
,THEVAN3D,2013-06-20T18:21Z,"if someone installed and is says tryout again, try reinstalling and inserting photoshop cc amtlib.dll instead of one included here. may work."
,THEVAN3D,2013-06-20T18:53Z,"included amtlib.dll does nothing. the photoshop amtlib.dll at least blocks the program from signing in, in the Help menu 'sign in' and 'updates' sections are no longer turned on at least. but the word tryout  still remains both, on the splash screen and in help  > about illustrator 

FIX THIS PLEASE"
[V],Ching_Liu,2013-06-21T01:35Z,@THEVAN3D - Do not panic mate. It is ok. 
,isohaven,2013-06-21T02:02Z,Why does the Illustrator instructions say to close your internet connection?  If you do that then the app wont install.
,THEVAN3D,2013-06-21T05:16Z,"Ching_Liu, im not panicking :D just trying to find the way :D anyway, if you say its okay, then i trust you. thanks for sharing. good luck ;)"
,HKCannibal,2013-06-21T05:38Z,Thanks a lot!
,jerbau,2013-06-22T06:24Z,If the splash screen bothers you too much. Look for ai_cc_splash_tryout.png & ai_cc_splash_tryout@2x.png. *hint hint*
