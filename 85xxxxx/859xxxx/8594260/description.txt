ΓÇ£Where the mind is without fear
 and the head is held high,
 where knowledge is free.
 Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls.
 Where words come out from the depth of truth,
 where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection.
 Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way
 into the dreary desert sand of dead habit.
 Where the mind is led forward by thee
 into ever widening thought and action.
 In to that heaven of freedom, my father,
 LET MY COUNTRY AWAKE!ΓÇ¥

Rabindranath Tagore, Gitanjali

Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel laureate poet, writer, philosopher was the ambassador of Indian culture to the rest of the world. Rabindranath Thakur,anglicised to Tagore (7 May 1861 ΓÇô 7 August 1941), was a Bengali polymath who reshaped his region's literature and music. Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; his seemingly mesmeric personality, flowing hair, and otherworldly dress earned him a prophet-like reputation in the West.

 Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of modern India.
