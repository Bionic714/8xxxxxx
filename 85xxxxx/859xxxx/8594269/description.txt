Imprisoned, starved and left with no 

memories, Thalia awakens to find herself at the mercy of an evil 

cult known as the Septori. Their leader has chosen Thalia as the 

test subject for a torture device of untold power, designed to 

change and twist her into something that is neither human nor 

Denai.


Escaping, Thalia finds an unwilling warrior to protect her and an 

unlikely Denai to befriend her. After finding a home at the Citadel 

as a servant, ThaliaΓÇÖs worst nightmare comes to life and she begins 

to show signs of power. Scared and unable to control her gifts, she 

tries to hide her past to fit in among the Denai. But the Septori 

want their latest test subject back and will stop at nothing to 

retrieve her, dead or alive.
