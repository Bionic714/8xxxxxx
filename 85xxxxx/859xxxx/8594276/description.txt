Leona Naess's third album takes a turn away from the radio-ready veneer of 2001's I Tried to Rock You But You Only Roll in favor of the more austere arrangements of producer/multi-instrumentalist Ethan Johns (Ryan Adams, Rufus Wainwright). Less immediately ear-grabbing than the previous disc, this self-titled record nonetheless sinks in deeply after a mere handful of plays. Naess's songs are closely observed and occasionally diary-like: in "Star Signs," she recounts her reading a former lover's horoscopes, while "Dues to Pay" draws parallels between career and romantic hard knocks. Whether aiming for Tom Petty-style folk-rock or surrounded by a small group of string players, Naess's voice remains a truly affecting instrument, wistful and full-voiced at once. Hurt or not, you know, she'll get by.
