After finally settling into her new 

life at the Citadel, Thalia is reunited with her father, who is 

disturbed at the changes within her. Risking banishment, Thalia 

must work to prove to her clan and herself that she is still 

capable of leading them. The problem is, her memories havenΓÇÖt 

returned, and she cannot shake the feeling that she doesnΓÇÖt belong. 


Thalia discovers that betrayal runs deep within her clan, just as 

she sets out to join Joss and Kael in doing the one thing she fears 

most: track the Septori to save JossΓÇÖ kidnapped sister. Along the 

way, she must confront her own fears on a journey of self-discovery 

that will take her deep into the stronghold of Denai; as they 

travel to the ancient floating city of Skyfell.
