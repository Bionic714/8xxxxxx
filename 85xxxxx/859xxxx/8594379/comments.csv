,saint84,2013-06-20T11:24Z,review . since no info from the uploader . justice release is much better . the picutre is less washed up. and the sound is way much better . this audio has too much echo and it is smaller . so this release is not an improvement . i just compared the sample with the other release with vcl . a big difference . so my vote is down for this one
