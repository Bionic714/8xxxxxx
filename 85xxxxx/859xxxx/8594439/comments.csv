,PartTimerHere,2013-06-20T12:01Z,"Thank you so much for all your uploads. I love that someone finally has some sports available, thank you. Awesome!

I only registered an account so I could make this comment/request, so please don't take offense from it.

My request is to please change the filenaming conventions (I know minor, because I can do it myself after the fact). The way they are listed for download is awesome, but the filenames themselves I manually change.

If it was NHL.2013.06.19 (then whatever, SCF.G4.TEAMS.RESOLUTION) I like how you added things like scf g4.

But this way if different sports are all downloaded to the same folder you need only sort by name and the sports would be divided and they would drop into chronological order as well. Or probably better actually if people ARE downloading multiple sports, would be ""2013.06.19.NHL.all.the.other.details.and.resolution"" that way they are very easily listed chronologically first, which I think is key for sports, especially if like me someone has to wait a while to get to watch the games. The most important thing at that point to me is that you're watching the games in the order they happened.

Which I guess, if you wanted to get really crazy with it you could add the start time to each after the date and before the sport from the same time zone each time to make it standard.

Once again, thank you so much, and I look forward to the next hockey season even more now that I've found this."

[V],Nepotu,2013-06-20T14:36Z,"@PartTimerHere: YW! And thank you for your appreciation! For the labeling issue, almost all of my uploads have been labeled by the ripper (see credits). Only a few torrents was labeled by me (FC Barcelona's games, for example). So, I can't do nothing about it. Sorry, my friend!
PS: I didn't felt offended by your comment. Furthermore, I'm agree with you, but..."
