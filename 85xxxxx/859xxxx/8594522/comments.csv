,tuia2012,2013-06-20T20:56Z,"egclocknload, read the Notes section in the description above.
This BF1942 torrent allows you to choose any widescreen resolutions (1366x768, 1920x1080, etc.) opposite to all the other BF1942 torrent releases and BF1942 download from Origin. This release also includes higher resolution menu and HUD icons."
,hopedeny,2013-06-20T21:44Z,"besides, many people myself included simply prefer downloading in the torrent format."
,nignug,2013-06-21T02:28Z,There are also still a few servers out there that only work with the original game. Origin version only has like 2 popped servers. And they are full of dumb shit nubs.
,Bean-Bandit,2013-06-21T06:20Z,"Actually even the free one you can play in HD. This has been talked about on Origin. 

If I have a valid CD Key then I wouldn't need this at all. This is a waste of time."
,tuia2012,2013-06-21T10:31Z,"Unless you use a patched executable, you can't play BF1942 from Origin in true HD, because image is stretched sideways. You can't choose widescreen resolutions from in-game Video menu, you have to manually edit video.con file. This is a smaller release than Origin's, including all maps, better icons, small fixes and isn't bundled with Origin spyware.
If you have a valid CD-key you can play on all servers."
