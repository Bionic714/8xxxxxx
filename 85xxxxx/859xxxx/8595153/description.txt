Gia, the young woman swept off her feet by the prince and taken to Paris. Maddy, head over heels in love and showing off her engagement ring. Alysha, seeking desperately to find the one special guy for a long term relationship. Like the characters that grace the pages of her novels, Bailey is seeking that one true love. Maybe she has already found it!
