,moeburn1,2013-06-20T18:40Z,"I just wanted to download the demo, not the whole game.  They said they made the demo available on June 12th for PC and 360, but I can't find a single link to download the demo ANYWHERE, not on their website, facebook, or any mirrors.  

It shouldn't be easier to pirate the full game than to get the legal demo!"

@moeburn1 ive had it for awhile youve just got to search in the right spots... gamershell"
,Pythonidae,2013-06-21T01:00Z,"Thx for this, however I have a question. 

Several of the Moto3 riders can't be selected with a message saying "" requires dlc "" popping up. 

Is this some sort of an anti-piracy stuff? Is it a bad release? Bad crack? Something? 

Since it is strange to cut out legit moto3 riders and sell them for dlc, especially since I haven't heard anything about it."
