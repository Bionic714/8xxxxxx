One of the earliest feature-length animated film - and oldest to have survived - Lotte Reiniger's 1926 film inspired by the "Arabian Nights" remains a cinematic marvel. The films tells of a wicked sorcerer who tricks Prince Achmed into riding a magical flying horse. The heroic prince is able to subdue the magical horse, which he uses to fly off to many adventures. While travelling, he falls in love with the beautiful Princess Peri Banu and must defeat an army of demons to win her heart.The entire film, who took three years to make in a home studio, is animated using the silhouette technique, which employs movable cardboard and metal cutouts posed in front of illuminated sheets of glass. This restoration features the original color tinting and a new orchestral score.
