After having spent 10 days downloading graf_z's DVD rip at..  http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4474145
..I thought it might be useful to provide it encoded to a smaller
file size. I took the liberty of doing so, and of leaving out the
director's comments.

I am aware 1.6G is probably far too big considering the resolution
and duration, but as I am clueless about tuning x264, I just went
with +/- Handbrake's defaults (variable framerate, 2-pass encoding
with bitrate set to 2200). Even if the quality doesn't warrant the
file size, it's about 40% of that of the DVD, which I hope makes it
worth it.
