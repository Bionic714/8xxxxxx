AM's 'Future Sons & Daughters' is a moody and inspired album that touches on all of the New Orleans-musician's favorite styles from baroque chamber pieces to mid-tempo country rockers. In that sense, such tracks as the atmospheric Phil Spector-ish number "The Other Side," the lead single "Grand Opinion," and the mellow country-rock anthem "Fortunate Family Tree" deliver on AM's knack for quirky '60s pop-inspired songs. Similarly, the duet with Angela Correa, "It's Been so Long," is pleasantly reminiscent of the classic Lee Hazlewood/Nancy Sinatra pairings. Fans of introspective, classicist pop with more than a bit of wit and charm should find much to enjoy on 'Future Sons & Daughters'. 

AM brings a heady brew of twinkling Anglified folk-rock-pop, twanging Americana, caressing Philly soul and funky R&B whatchacallit -- and, best of all, joyously unheard points in-between. With, arguably, some of the best bridges and choruses in the business, drawing from The Beatles and Badfinger or Curtis Mayfield and Jorge Ben.
