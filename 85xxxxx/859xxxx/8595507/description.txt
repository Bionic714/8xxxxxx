A film about one of Britain's strangest phone
helplines - Anomalous Mind Management Abductee
Contactee Helpline, or AMMACH, the 999 for
people who believe they have been victims of
alien abduction.

The film follows some of the 100 members who use
the helpline, including Simon, a town councillor
who believes that in addition to his earthbound
wife he has a family of alien children with an
alien lover.

There's also Chantelle, a housewife who's been
abducted thousands of times and wants her
encounters to stop.

Marie is an accountant who believes that her DNA
has been altered and that she may be part alien.

These ordinary people all share the extraordinary
belief that they have had alien encounters, and
have contacted AMMACH in a bid to understand why
these strange other worldly experiences are
happening to them.
