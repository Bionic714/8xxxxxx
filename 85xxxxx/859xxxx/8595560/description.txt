A provocative examination of the artistic interpretation of twelve of BorgesΓÇÖs most famous stories.

In this groundbreaking book, Jorge J. E. Gracia explores the artistic interpretation of fiction from a philosophical perspective. Focusing on the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most celebrated literary figures of Latin America, Gracia offers original interpretations of twelve of BorgesΓÇÖs most famous stories about identity and memory, freedom and destiny, and faith and divinity. He also examines twenty-four artistic interpretations of these storiesΓÇötwo for eachΓÇöby contemporary Argentinean and Cuban artists such as Carlos Estevez, Leon Ferrari, Mirta Kupferminc, Nicolas Menza, and Estela Pereda. This philosophical exploration of how artists have interpreted literature contributes to both aesthetics and hermeneutics, makes new inroads into the understanding of BorgesΓÇÖs work, and introduces readers to two of the most vibrant artistic currents today. Color images of the artworks discussed are included.

ΓÇ£From Michel Foucault to Arthur Danto, the use of Borges to analyze art isnΓÇÖt new, but Painting Borges goes a step further: it looks at Borges as an inspiration to painters while also interpreting hermeneutically the way he himself looked at things through his blind eyes. I found Jorge J. E. GraciaΓÇÖs volume provocative, engaging, and exhaustive in its approach.ΓÇ¥ ΓÇö Ilan Stavans, Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture, Amherst College
