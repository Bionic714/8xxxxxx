,m0ww0w,2013-06-20T23:12Z,useless unzipped and a dupe.
,firefox90,2013-06-21T03:41Z,stops at 57 percent
,juanjovaldes,2013-06-22T02:45Z,SEED!!!
,sooshicat,2013-06-22T16:22Z,took ages but i finally got this.. works perfect i dunno what you're talking about @m0ww0w ... being unzipped doesn't influence anything
,sooshicat,2013-06-22T16:43Z,"if u have issues with opening it, just go to terminal and type chmod a+x then press space and drag the walking dead .app into the terminal window,press enter, type your password and press enter again (it wont show up while you type) and then that should change permissions and let u run it"
,Coasty44,2013-06-23T00:48Z,I still cannot get it to work. It has all permissions. I click on it and it won't open at all. Any help?
