I noticed there wasn't a complete working version of this game online, So I compiled a bunch of other torrents into a single working application.
Simply open up the folder and run the .app and it should work.

As far as my knowledge goes it works on anything above Snow Leopard (10.6.8) This is what I am running it on and it works perfectly.

Feel free to comment with issues and I will try to help :)
