,lenky,2013-06-21T22:21Z,Thx for the upload but could you pl upload with a better quality (higher bitrate)
,lenky,2013-06-21T22:30Z,The techniques is one of my favorite rocksteady groups
,OrajelJunkie,2013-06-22T06:59Z,"If i had better quality don't you think i would have uploaded it?
Your ears probably couldn't even tell the difference.
If they could,then you're just a bitrate snob who didn't have to suffer through tape hiss and vinyl pops.
Only thing worse than a snob is a snob who doesn't contribute."
,lenky,2013-06-22T17:21Z,"Wow, I can see that you're very sensitive.  You've taken my comments the wrong way because they were not meant to offend you. I do appreciate the time you've taken to make the upload."
,OrajelJunkie,2013-06-22T20:38Z,"Not sensitive,just fed up.I apologize for being snippy but everywhere i go i hear the same question.Thinking i have a higher quality and still chose to post the lower quality is just silly.These old ska and reggae records are nearly impossible to find on cd.Some are vinyl rips,doesn't get much worse than that,but I can guarantee this is the highest quality anyone in the world has."
,lenky,2013-06-22T22:14Z,I agree.
