,ns0l,2013-06-21T17:31Z,thanks. It's working with the new crack. the only problem is: LumaEmu.ini not found. solved by renaming it. It'll happen every time you change the configuration. so find your good video configs and don't change it again if you don't want this problem to occur.
,ns0l,2013-06-21T22:08Z,Also change the language by LumaEmu.ini
,moedown,2013-06-22T02:18Z,"  Not sure what the problem is, but I've downloaded 3 seperate versions of this, and every time I start a game, my character is stuck constantly spinning to the left, rendering it unplayable...anyone know what my problem is?"
,ns0l,2013-06-22T15:00Z,"I think It's your hardware, check the system requirment. If not update your video card driver and see. Or just try rendering the game video configs to low and turn off antialiasing and verticle sync. I hope this helps"
