One of Walters' most highly rated works, another creepy detective story. Isn't it funny how English crime fiction comes more and more to resemble ghost stories? I think that using a medieval torture implement cheapens the story somewhat, to the level of slasher movies; the most profound torments are not physical.

Enjoy!
