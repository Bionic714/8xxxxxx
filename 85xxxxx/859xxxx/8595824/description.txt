Old Sock is the 21st studio album by English rock guitarist and singer Eric Clapton.[1] It features two new compositions ("Gotta Get Over" and "Every Little Thing"), and covers of some of his favourite songs from childhood to the current day. It also features several guests including Steve Winwood, JJ Cale and Paul McCartney.[2]
It reached No11 in the UK Album Chart and No7 in the US.
Clapton explained in an interview with the BBC that he came up with the album title after a conversation with David Bowie. The album cover is a self-portrait Clapton took with his iPhone while on holiday in Antigua.[3]
