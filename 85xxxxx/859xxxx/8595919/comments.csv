,csevrence,2013-06-20T21:21Z,After mounting the image I scanned the files on the disk with ESET.  Apparently there's a trojan.. who knows maybe its one of those false positives.

,hopedeny,2013-06-20T21:41Z,ugh. are people STILL talking about trojans due to cracked files?

,Aoishiro,2013-06-21T08:53Z,Thank you Mr.Stifmeister and Walmart. I was waiting for a scene release on this game. Walmart is really doing a great job so far.
,blomster51,2013-06-21T11:16Z,Tack för alla fina uppladdningar! Om du har Le Tour De France 2013 till PC vore jag oändligt tacksam för en uppladdning.
,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-06-22T15:48Z,"Doesn't work for me. I get the following error message:

""The program can't start because MSVCP110.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.""

Reinstalling didn't help."
,UglyDucklingxyz,2013-06-22T16:03Z,"The following helped, copied from the other torrent:

""if you get the error message msvcp110.dll is missing goto http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30679 and download it.vsu1vcredist_x64.exe is for laptops and vsu1vcredist_x86.exe is for desktop.Also add the ManaGame file to your exceptions in your Antivirus program if you get a black screen or it freezes at the Capcom screen."""
,Hajeil,2013-06-23T01:25Z,"There seems to be a problem with this crack. The game will not save. Upon starting the game it says it is writing save data. When it does this I noticed that it created a Walmart folder on my desktop. The folder contains another numbered empty folder. I'm pretty sure this is supposed to be the cracked save folder as I've seen other scene groups use this same method for creating their own save file folder location. Only those folders usually end up in your computer's user/documents location. Further when the game attempts any auto save it will tell you that it failed. I'm pretty sure this crack is creating the save folder in the wrong location (desktop) and not pointing the game to the appropriate location to save at. This need to be fixed with an updated crack release. I know this isn't your fault, Stif, since you are just the uploader. I just though people needed to know ahead of time. Hopefully when an appropriate crack is released we'll see you host that as well. In the mean time keep up the great work. I get a LOT of stuff from you. Thank you."
