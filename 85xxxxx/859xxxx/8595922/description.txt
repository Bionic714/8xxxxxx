 Who needs a whole book on knots? Campers, anglers, and weekend first mates to name a few, and they would be doing themselves a great favor checking out this wonderfully illustrated guide to knot tying. Need a secure loop tied in the middle of a rope during your next camping trip? Bowline on the Bight to the rescue. Lash a canoe firmly in place atop your car? A clove hitch, maybe, though the smart move is to add one more loop to create the nearly immovable constrictor knot. Each knot is presented with step-by-step photos and concise instructions, and even the novice will be able to whip out surgeon's knots and Italian hitches before they know it--as this reviewer can attest! The chapter on braiding will be especially appreciated by home crafters. A fine little book Brian McCombie --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.
