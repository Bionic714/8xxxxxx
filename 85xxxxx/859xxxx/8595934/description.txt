"The prime merit of the book lies in its systematic investigation into the tumultuous evolution
of the Antonescu regime and into his personal life. In addition, the combination of
historical details with societal factors brings new facets to this analysis. Thus, examination of
the Iron Guard leadership and of religious confessions in Romania helps to decipher the
atmosphere of those times. In addition, Deletant’s writing style makes the book a gripping
read, revealing the intimate connections between the personal life of the dictator and the
political evolution of his regime. These points, coupled with the fact that most probably
Antonescu remained the only leader who could publicly contradict the Führer, offer an
incisive image of ‘Hitler’s forgotten ally’." -- Lucian N. Leustean, European History Quarterly
 
"Basing his work on an extensive use of printed and archival sources, Deletant provides a detailed examination of Antonescu's role as leader of Romania and the policies he supervised. The author paints a sympathetic picture of Antonescu, deftly describing the precarious situation facing Romania during these years, but not obscuring the negative aspects of his rule. This book will be indispensable reading for anyone interested in the policies and politics of WWII... Essential." —CHOICE
