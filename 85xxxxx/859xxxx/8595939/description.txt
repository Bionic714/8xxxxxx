"Bo Diddley" is the debut album by rock and roll pioneer and blues icon Bo Diddley. It is a compilation of his singles since 1955.
It collects several of his most influential and enduring songs. Released on the Chess label in 1958.

The bonus tracks on this collection mostly come from Bo's '60s recordings when he was still at the top of his game: many come from the unjustly neglected "The Originator" album released in October 1966.
