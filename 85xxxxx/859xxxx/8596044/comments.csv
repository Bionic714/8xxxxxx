You always bring the best quality and since I was in high school have brought me gaming like I could NEVER afford! So THANKS SO MUCH for all you do


THAT said. Is anybody else having a weird issue where nothing happens when you try to run the starter through daemon tools?? If you (extremezone) or any other of my tbp brothers and sisters could help my helpless drunk ass out I would toast the rest of my shots tonight to you while I drive motorcycles at highs speeds drunk! Thanks in advance to any of you rad people who help me out lol THANKS"

hahahaha I am a drunk ass idiot.

If anyone else is a drunk ass idiot don't waste these guys/girls time. Explore the iso once mounted (don't use autoplay) and right click on setup application and click Run as Administrator)

Sorry for the Dramatics! ..... drunkmatics hahahahaha

Peace everyone!!  :D"
