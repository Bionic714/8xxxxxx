Meat Me in Cincinnati

Jeff Ruby, the biggest restaurateur in Cincinnati, is in desperate need of a new executive chef for his flagship steakhouse, the Precinct. Anne Burrell brings Jeff four candidates who are tasked with first creating a high-end steak dish using inexpensive cuts of meat and then they must create a signature dish to add to Precinct's menu. The final two chefs are handed the keys to Precinct restaurant for a dinner service: One candidate's focus on speed ends up causing execution issues, while the other candidate has a confrontation with the owner that could ruin their chances at getting the job.
