,alexslife,2013-06-22T01:29Z,"Exactly, I will never download YIFY torrent. There total crap and with he would get banned from the HD movie section"
,Josh1765,2013-06-22T01:57Z,@darcon I say get a decent pair of heaphones.  I just use my sennheiser 598s for listening to all my movies.  Sounds great and I don't bother anyone else.
,embassy1,2013-06-22T02:16Z,@alexslife exactly... I wish YIFY would get banned from posting in the HD Movies section. It's supposed to be for high quality movies and his shit is not high quality. BOZX always posts high quality stuff. Thanks dude.
,HooK_43,2013-06-22T03:23Z,"dam do we have bunch of immature children on TPB if any intelligent person know you are not going to get HD quality off the internet come on do you actually think youre getting blu ray quality??? no youre not you getting good quality by 1 file size 2 codecs and 3 patience and other things if you want blu ray quality then go buy the fucking blu ray and as for other quality it also depends on your tv processor at how fast it is just because your tv is 720p or 1080p doesnt mean its the best because if your procesor sucks  then so does your tv ...... read about tv processors before you start dogging out other up loaders and as far as file size some dont have unlimited band width like most of us in fact if this torrent was true blu ray quality the file would be atleast 14 gigs not 5.46 so all you fuck heads EAT DICK and quit complaining about some one elses hard work to bring free entertainment 

thanks for the upload im sure the quality is good down loading rite now "

1. This is 2013, learn what video compression is.

2. 4k display screens are still being worked on.

3. Huge file size doesn't mean perfect quality. almost 7k Kbps on a 720p is just... why? Mkv container can hold the same exact quality while dropping this down to a Gigabyte and a fraction of the bitrate. 

Anyone who thinks this is any better than the smaller files... Please, for the love of the HD community, learn about Video Compression. "

Funny how people complain, but it does not know anything about video compression codecs.
Some releases may have lower quality, but we must look for what purposes they are used. If I see a mobile device for example, you do not need a lot of bitrate, both audio, video as it will not benefit. Now if you have a high-quality equipment in my living room, I want the best, and download the version with the bitrate rate similar to the original file, burn a disc, and now I can say I'm actually watching a movie with quality BluRay ."
