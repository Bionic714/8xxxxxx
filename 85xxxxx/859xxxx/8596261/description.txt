Description :


A passive equalizer with powerful sound-shaping capabilities, the RS56 Universal Tone Control was 
originally introduced in the early 1950s and used in Abbey Road Studios to prepare recordings for 
the record-lathe, as part of the process we now know as ΓÇ£mastering.ΓÇ¥ Later, Abbey RoadΓÇÖs pop 
engineers began using the RS56 for studio recordings because of its abilities to dramatically 
manipulate sound ΓÇô unlike the basic treble and bass EQs found on the mixing consoles of the 
time. This earned it the nickname ΓÇ£The Curve Bender.ΓÇ¥

Waves and Abbey Road Studios have faithfully recreated the unique magic of the RS56, using 
advanced circuit modeling techniques based on the original schematics. Like its hardware pre-
decessor, the Waves: Abbey Road RS56 passive EQ plugin features three bands with four 
selectable center frequencies for each and six different filter types, plus independent or linked 
control over the left and right channels. The result is an extraordinary equalizer that is as 
effective today as it was when it was created over half a century ago.
