[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-21T09:16Z,I'm guessing you don't check to see if things have already been uploaded.
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-06-21T10:33Z,"LeonardTSpock:  Just took a look at your upload of this, and I can absolutely see why blackcanary would want to post this more properly.  You've removed all scanner credit from the filenames.  You've removed the scanner tag images from within the files, and you do NOT have the HD versions.  So simply put, your post of it is lacking. :)  I'd be happy to discuss with you a more appropriate way to post things that gives proper credit to the scanners responsible."
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-06-21T12:09Z,Thanks blackcanary!
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-23T10:44Z,"RubrumPopulus, there's no need for you to sarcastically talk down to me as if I don't know what I'm doing, because clearly, I do. I scan comic books and books and I take no credit. I remove the pointless and unnecessary scanner tags from books that I upload that I didn't scan. I still made the effort to find them, compile them, often restore them and then upload them with as much information in the description as possible, making sure that I never uploading anything that is already available. Should I create a tag to take credit for all that? No, I shouldn't. There will be no scanner tags in my uploads, no discussion necessary. "
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-23T11:20Z,"I mean SERIOUSLY, my post is lacking because there are no scanner names on the file or scanner tag images in the file? lol Give me a break. Seems to me that's EXACTLY what people want - the files. Do you honestly believe that anybody is downloading because of a scanner tag? Most anyone who knows how removes the tags. Further, you've got a nice big description field and endless comments section to tell people about the upload. The unnecessary ego stroking behind scanner tags is ridiculous. "
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-06-23T15:42Z,"LeonardTSpock:  Firstly I apologize for turning this comment thread into an unrelated discussion.  If you'd like to discuss it anymore we can do it in the forum via PM.  
As for your point, what it comes down to for me, is I think it's better to present the files as they were originally released, and let the end-user decide if they want to keep or remove the tags.  By you doing it for them, you've removed that decision from them.  As a distributor, I think our mandate should be to just distribute, not changing the files in the way we think they should be, and then distributing.  And if at the same time we can show respect to  the fine folks bringing these releases to us, then all the better. :)"
[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-23T20:54Z,"RubrumPopulus, if bc has a problem with this discussion I'll happily move it to the forum. For now I think it's something that needs to stay public for all to see.

I have nothing but respect for all the scanners - past, present and future. I've been very open about that. As a scanner myself I know how much time and energy it takes, so their work is infinitely appreciated. However, everyone knows that somebody had to scan the book (or, in this day and age, download it) in order for it to be made available as a torrent. What difference does it make who scanned it?

You can't honestly expect me to believe that a scanner tag is a sign of quality. I've been downloading books and comics for fifteen years (at least) and I can assure you they aren't. 

Everyone wants something different from their scans/files. Some people want them smaller, some want them larger. (Although, truthfully, they're getting too big. There needs to be some sort of an official scan/file size - but that's a different conversation entirely.) Further, the size of a scan, even an ""HD"" one, does not ensure qualit, either. Also, in this regard, all you have to do is look at the file size to get a reasonable idea of what you might expect. But most important, as I already mentioned, there is a huge description section in which to tell downloaders what they're getting. If it doesn't all fit there, continue in the descriptions. There's PLENTY of room to put scanner information in those fields. And, if a scanner really feels it's necessary, put their tag in the file name. At least that way the end user can easily remove it.

But tags in the files? No, I see no reason for them to even exist, let alone be included in my uploads. Honestly, there is no reason for them to exist beyond pride and ego, neither of which makes the slightest bit of sense to me on any level. We could get into the moral and ethical reasons why such a thing is completely ridiculous, but I'm sure we've all made peace with those issues long ago. We wouldn't be here, otherwise. I give credit in all of my uploads to the writers, illustrator and publishers, and that's the way I'm going to keep doing it. This doesn't mean I appreciate the scanners less than the next guy. In fact, I probably appreciate them more, as their work allows me to seek out the particular type of books I'm looking for. But giving credit for the scanning of somebody else's original work via a scanner or distributor tag is just not going to happen."
[V],RubrumPopulus,2013-06-23T22:40Z,"I appreciate your point of view and some of the things you've said make good sense.  I still think leaving that decision to remove a tag or not to remove a tag should be in the hands of the good users of this site.  You may find them unnecessary, but some folks may not.  Who am I, or blackcanary, or you to say what another should value.  
But I'd also like to address a couple of the things you just said.  First, your point about there being ample space to express your thanks and give credit for the scan in the torrent description field.  That is true, good posts with highly descriptive text is a great thing, and can work wonders to give credit as well as describe the quality and details of a scan.  But consider that the life of that file is goes far beyond this website.  Someone grabs the file here, that has had credit removed, and sure that particular downloader will know the ins and outs of that scan, but anyone that HE shares it with now will not.  So after that one-time handoff that knowledge is lost.
Another thing you mentioned was that ""what does it matter who scans it"".  Well I think a lot of folks who've been in the community for a while will say there is absolutely a difference in scan/edit quality from scanner to scanner.  Some who have been around for a while may even have their own favorite scanner, or scanner group.  Given a choice between to scans they may favor one over another simply based on the fact that a scanner they like has done it.  It has a lot to do with consistency and familiarity with quality.  If you know scanner X always does scans at a particular quality you like, then you may actively seek their work.  Not for ego's sake, but just because you're used to their style.  Preserving that information gives more information to users down the road and enables them to make more informed choices.  
Finally, there's the matter of ""lost"" scans.  This community has been around for well over a decade, and sadly many of the early scans or even scans that are only 6 or 7 years old,  many of those have been lost.  Meaning almost impossible to find anywhere.  A BIG contributor to the loss of scans over time is them being altered in some way that changes their Hash signature.  Renaming obviously doesn't harm anything, but changes to the archive itself does.  If scans are kept in ""release"" condition as long as possible, where a larger pool of folks all have files with the same hash value, i.e. the exact same file, then it's far less likely that the scan will be lost to posterity.  If, however, this guy over here alters and distributes a file with a different hash, this other guy over here alters it differently and distributes it, etc.  It fractures that pool of pristine files.  5 years down the way it becomes far more likely that that file will be lost.
It's impossible to dictate what folks do in the confines of their own library of comics.  I'd never presume to do that.  But once we put our distributor hats on, I think we have an added responsibility to consider these things :)"
