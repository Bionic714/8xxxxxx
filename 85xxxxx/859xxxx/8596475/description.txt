Knuckles, the Malevolent Nun is a wonderfully funny series about a grotesquely ugly nun with an attitude to match her looks. Knuckles, however unorthodox, is a likable character. She is constantly accompanied by Witchbite, a talking crow sent by God to observe her. She is also constantly being courted by Lucifer, the prince of darkness, who also happens to wear nothing except a pair of briefs and a pumpkin on his head. Sadly for the course of true love, he is continually denied KnucklesΓÇÖ affection.

Like anyone else, Knuckles has her dark side. For one thing, she excels at passing off bird excrement as art, making her millions of dollars. This doesnΓÇÖt exactly bode well for her vows.
