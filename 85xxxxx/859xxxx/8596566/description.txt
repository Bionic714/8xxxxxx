Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Thursday, June 20 edition of The Alex Jones Show, Alex breaks down the assassination of journalist Michael Hastings and exposes the ugly fact that Obama's domestic assassination policy has gone live against truth tellers perceived by government to be enemies of the state. 

Alex also covers the sliding economy as the stock market plunges in response to Federal Reserve boss Bernanke's pronouncements earlier this week. 

On today's broadcast, Alex talks in-studio with Michael Cargill, the owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin. Cargill set up a Groupon deal in January for a concealed handgun course that was on track to sell-out within a day. Groupon responded by shutting down Cargill's deal covering gun training, shooting clays, and gun ranges.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
