PLOT
The story of two coalitions -- ACT UP and TAG (Treatment Action Group) -- 
whose activism and innovation turned AIDS from a death sentence into a 
manageable condition. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the disease 
was considered a death sentence affecting communities, like the LGBT ones, 
whom many in power felt deserved it. This film tells the story of how 
militant activists like ACT-UP and TAG pushed for a meaningful response to 
this serious public health problem. As the activists struggled against 
political indifference, religious hostility, corporate greed and apparently 
skewed scientific research priorities with determination and sheer 
audacity, they produced a political wave that would lead to not only an 
effective treatment regime, but would advance LGBT rights beyond anyone's 
expectations.
