Storyline: Upbeat coming-of-age story about a smart teenage girl who has to face life full on when she falls pregnant. When Juno (Ellen Page), a teenager with all the answers, finds out she's pregnant to her classmate Bleeker (Michael Cera), she soon realises she has to ask for help from family and friends. Luckily, she enlists the help of her best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) in trying to find a couple to adopt her unborn child, while her understanding parents (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) provide the support she needs to help her through some tough times. When Leah finally uncovers a young, affluent couple, Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), desperate to adopt, it seems the perfect solution, until Juno finds herself having to face some serious adult decisions while trying to figure out her place in the world.
