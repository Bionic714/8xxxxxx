Only in America S03E07 Larry Crushes the Competition
Larry road trips through Missouri to show how American obsessions can turn into everything from extremely odd contests to a billion-dollar business. He starts by seeing just how far a fixation with anvils can take a manΓÇôand it's a lot farther than you think. Then he goes on a rabbit hunt the very old fashioned wayΓÇôby using predatory birds, but gets both less and more than he bargained for. After a quick stop to take in the astonishing sight of the smallest horse in the world he heads off to Hazelwood, MO, where one man's obsession led to the birth of the Great American Monster Truck. Larry not only drives Bigfoot, the very first monster truck, but also Bigfoot #5ΓÇôTHE biggest truck in the world. You have to see it to believe it.
