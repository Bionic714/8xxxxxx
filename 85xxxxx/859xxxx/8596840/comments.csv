Q: Any sources for large selections of ""Viz"" Magazine UK? Those of us in the US who pirated the tie-in PC game in the early 90s would love to finally get some real feel for what the fucking game was all about after all these years. *I* found out only a few years ago when I came across some Limey's small collection at a garage sale - he was going back home, and his neighbors were happy to chip in considering how quick his stuff went! - but the old H/P/A gang that's still alive all still have their copies, some burned to M-Disk out of spite against nature, are all now interested in getting back into the game now that they can figure out what the gags were all about besides ""Johnny Fartpants"".

...So again, thanks for all the magz, Mr. A. Your efforts helped me in selecting the right components in a system build recently, and here's hoping you - or someone reading this - knows where to find back issue collections of ""Viz"".

Oh, and if you happen to find a stale archive of ""Byte"", feel free to post that one. Once upon a time, that was a book one read religiously. Of course, OS/2 was still believed - and rightly so - to be the future of GUI computing, but the majority of those concept articles, especially those dealing with the genesis of CGI, are still valid foundational reading material 30 years after they were written. Some of those early algorithms they did for Mandelbrot and Julia set computation, and dealing with their relationships to ""strange attractor"" math, still haven't been recoded into Javascript or even C# to run on computers hundreds of times more powerful than the PCs, Jrs and Apple ][e's they were written for."
