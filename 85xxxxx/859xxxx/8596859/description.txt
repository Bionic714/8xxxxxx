Deadlock (1970), directed by Roland Klick.

Roland Klick's fleabitten contemporary acid western concerns the maneuvers of three men and a suitcase of cash in a decrepit mining town. The lexicon is straight up Leone stripped to its essential gestures, iconography and set-ups with a poetic sense of landscape recalling Malick and Zabriske Point. Another way of framing it is El Topo with machine guns; Jodorowsky himself called Deadlock "fantasticΓÇôa bizarre, glowing film." Can's pounding toms, searing Morricone-overdrive guitars and noirish tango are a major presence. Their score for Deadlock also represents the first appearances of vocalist Damo Suzuki, who was with the band for their classic albums Tago Mago, Ege Bamyasi and Future Days.
