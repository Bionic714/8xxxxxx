,HumanThePerson,2013-06-21T02:50Z,Needs more seeders!
,Richterx8,2013-06-21T04:26Z,=| I would be fine with bad angle and bad quality... but really 30mins? Did the recorder like rage quit half way thru? Or like have to pee in the middle...
,HumanThePerson,2013-06-21T04:59Z,It's a good torrent if you're okay with just listening
,Exussit,2013-06-21T06:26Z,"Damn it! Been waiting for this, I could live with the shit quality... But what happened to the rest? :("
,SOTR8472,2013-06-21T13:43Z,"this thing is not worth the download. The camera seems to be hidden somewhere on the seat and so you can't see more than a quarter of the screen. 

This isn't just crap quality, it's unwatchable."
,Freodon,2013-06-21T15:29Z,"It's legit and the quality is GOOD EXPECT the angle is horrible... only 15% or so of the screen is visible, I'm hoping for a good recordings from upcoming weekend ;]"
,linkbro123,2013-06-21T21:08Z,"I'm sorry for the crap quality. I found a leak and noticed it was legit, so I uploaded it here. I'm pretty sure a better copy will be uploaded on the weekend. I can't believe I actually want to watch this, damn hiatus!"
,radiored,2013-06-21T21:37Z,"or how about you people do what i did, spent the money and watch this IN THEATERS! Heck i saw it TWICE!
im assuming 100% of you are bronies, act like it, support MLP rather than siphon it from a torrent"
,DTBrown72,2013-06-22T04:40Z,hey radiored you do know that the movie is in limited release and most the country can not just go see it even if we wanted to.
,HTD,2013-06-22T10:56Z,"radiored : I would love to... but besides of movie ticket, I would have to buy a ticket for a plane from Europe to North America and back. That would be mighty overkill. I dont want to wait for DVD.

And whenever I download movie from torrent and end up liking it, I buy it on DVD later, to be fair to those, who make quality movies. 
I have a decent collection of DVDs..."
,Exussit,2013-06-22T17:29Z,"As much as I would rather go and see this instead of torrenting it, it doesn't hit cinemas in my country until the 24th of August! ;_;"
,Boogurz,2013-06-23T00:19Z,THE HIGHEST FORM OF AUTISM!
,Green.Banana,2013-06-24T00:22Z,"Whatever happened to the versions given out for press purposes only?  Considering any twat with a blog can be treated like a member of the media's harem, I'm surprised we don't all have this already.  "
