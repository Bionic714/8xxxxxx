 Evan Osborne, "Reasonably Simple Economics: Why the World Works the Way It Does"
English | ISBN: 1430259418 | 2013 |  PDF | 332 pages | 

The goal of Reasonably Simple Economics is, not surprisingly, simple: to help us think like economists. When we do, so much of the world that seemed mysterious or baffling becomes more clear and understandableΓÇöimproving our lives and providing new tools to succeed in business and career.

In a chatty style, economist Evan Osborne explains the economic foundations behind the things we read about or see in the news everyday:
Why prices for goods and services are what they are
How government spending, regulation, and taxation can both hinder and help the economy
Why and how some people get fabulously rich
How entrepreneurs reorganize society beneficially
Why markets sometimes fail and when or if governments should intervene when they do
How economics and statistics can explain such things as discrimination in hiring and providing services (and why discriminators are shooting themselves in the foot), why weΓÇÖre smarter than weΓÇÖve ever been, and how technology makes the idea of EarthΓÇÖs ΓÇ£carrying capacityΓÇ¥ meaningless
