,northwind_highlander,2013-06-22T10:05Z,"why do people with such piss poor upload speed upload such large files... dont get me wrong, im greatful for the upload... but seriously... 4 hours, almost 5 downloading, and all i have to show for it is 274mb out of 1.61 gigs... 

this is just completely uncalled for."
,bad_pirate_4u_62,2013-06-22T13:33Z,"WOW? Northwind Highlander are you kidding? I upload something for free and you bitch about it? where do you get off, sorry I don't have a dedicated T1 line so you can come along steal a torrent and go away. I have to go to work now to do my full time job so piss off if my upload speed isn't good ewnough for you."
