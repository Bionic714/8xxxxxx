Lyrics:

Zooma zoom zoom zoom...

yeah

I know you need a little
background clear though
about yer boy Deltron Zero,
your hero
In three thousand thirty,
we ain't in the clear though.
We was near toast,
doing too much, who to trust
in a land so scandalous and
grand?
Even the President got his
hand in the contraband.
They done control the band of
information
leading to education to your
brainwaves pulsatin'.
They said "Fuck the
environment!"
For so long the environment
said "Fuck y'all".
Ok, now we in a cobra clutch
once the planet fold up, and
blow up. You know what?
Mother Nature must've saved
us cause look,
we still stayed here.
But much was lost.
We lost touch with the source.
To get back, there was a hero,
jet black
who was kin to the previous
champion
in three thousand thirty, but
now it's four thousand ten.
From the ashes I arise with
the new style,
this Deltron Osiris.
If you can buy this, let's go
along
and see how we go so far, the
road is gone
Osiris, I'm here in the afterlife
in the future where brothers
will have to fight...

Everybody call it a scramble
Full scale chaos,
reckless abandon
Cats will sell they
hand for a handgun
Follow your commander,
though you can't stand him
No plannin', wild and dangerous
Anger just permeate,
so we learn to take
hostility with a grain of salt
and step out the way,
cause it ain't our fault
Bank vaults,
blown to smithereens
Whatever's left is
theft for the fiends.
But you'd better not mess with
the team
Deltron and damn, we melt
foes to ash
there in a flash, and not in the
pan
it's all in the plan in a lawless
land
Just so y'all can understand,
I got a legacy to chase
live up the fam..

who was kin to the previous
champion
in three thousand thirty, but
now it's four thousand ten.
From the ashes I arise with
the new style,
this Deltron Osiris.
If you can buy this, let's go
along
and see how we go so far, the
road is gone
Osiris, I'm here in the afterlife
in the future where brothers
will have to fight...

For the power
now you're been devoured
by sound waves
frequency with a deeperly
Creep with me, as I bail
through the hood
with unsavory types, most
likely no good
in the eyes of society's visor
Even though their enterprises
are the crisis
they license been revoked
by the average trench coat
pulling out so you get smoked
Blahhh
Like hickory sausage
victory? come on, it's far from
flawless
They ain't God, but their ways
is pompous
thinking they can stomp us
with troops and contras
but just let loose a stupid
monster, unable to be contained.
It's too late, they launched it
with no promotion
so now we revolt
and insult they sultan
with explosive voltage

who was kin to the previous
champion
in three thousand thirty, but
now it's four thousand ten.
From the ashes I arise with
the new style,
this Deltron Osiris.
If you can buy this, let's go
along
and see how we go so far, the
road is gone
Osiris, I'm here in the afterlife
in the future where brothers
will have to fight...

Kaboooom!!!
Guess that must spell doom
You! You wish to defeat me?
Me, with your feeble mind?!?
Huh. I see you high.
Fuckin' with me, Deltron Osiris
Fam put me on,
we gonna live long, that's what
it is
Now, next meeting is
underground in the West Matrix
underneath the Statue of
Liberty's remains
Now shhh...
I'm gonna scramble the
frequency being transmitted over the
pirate communications matrix,
because there was word that the rebel
trolls from the new sector have
secured nodes within the matrix...
Shhh... don't say nothin',
we gonna creep up on 'em
tonight, ok.....
