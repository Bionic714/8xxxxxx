A recently unemployed mechanic attempting to maintain his financial stability finds that sometimes living is defined by more than just an income in director Carlos Sorin's endearing existential comedy drama. The Patagonia garage in which Coco (Juan Villegas) works has gone out of business, and after failing to find employment as a mechanic elsewhere, Coco hits the road to sell his finely crafted homemade knives. When that too proves a noble failure, Coco's life takes an interesting turn when, after rescuing a woman stranded far from home, the kindly wanderer is rewarded with a magnificent, specially-bred Argentine dog that he soon decides to take on the dog-show circuit. Of course the inexperienced Coco will need assistance in navigating the curious world of canine beauty pageants, and after meeting up with a carefree dog trainer named Walter (Walter Donado), the newly emboldened trio hit the road to seek out their fortune in an uncertain -- but certainly promising -- future.
