The SpongeBob Comics Swimtacular celebrates the submarine superheroics of SpongeBob's idols, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, in forty-eight all-new pages!  First, bear witness to a reunion of Mermaid Man's Golden Age team, the Aquatic Adventurers, in a story we could only call "Lo, There Shall Be a Catered Event," featuring funky flashbacks by Jerry Ordway (Superman)!  Then, SpongeBob and Patrick's game of superheroes goes from silly to sillier, when they encounter the quiet-loving super-fiend known only as Mendu! Who could this green, big-nosed, tentacled villain possibly be?  Next, legendary Silver Age artist Ramona Fradon (Metamorpho) returns to SpongeBob Comics to draw the never-before-seen Mermaid Man classic "Sidekick Blues," featuring the sinister Controlling Conch and the rarely sighted Edwardian Age Mermaid Man.  All this plus a tour of the Mermalair, Plankton and Gary's brief super-careers, spoofs of classic comic book ads, and a double-page spread depicting every Bikini Bottom superhero and villain!
