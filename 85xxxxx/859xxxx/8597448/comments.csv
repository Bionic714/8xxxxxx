Its not bad its about as good as that really good iron man 3 r6 that came out like a month and a half ago. Definitely not dvd quality but better then most if not all cams. 

Question this has nothing to do with this torrent, but how do you report uploaders? That searchkill guy has released like 30 bs torrents in the last 10 minutes. They all claim to be br rips when i and hopefully everyone else knows its bullshit. Like for example he uploaded the new thor movie which the last time i checked is still in production. So anyone who downloads this torrent please flag this guy odds are hes releasing a virus. All of the files he has uploaded are roughly the same length between 624 mb and 626 mb. Which just means hes adding extra text documents so the uploads will be different sizes. "

,product_of_fallout,2013-06-21T06:52Z,good god guys this torrent has been out for less then three hours. Seed people!!! Respect the uploader and future seeders. At least delete it off of your computer. This is ridiculous.
,whadjasai,2013-06-21T07:17Z,Does this have hard Chinese subs?
,some-young-guy,2013-06-21T07:22Z,"To report bad torrents or uploaders, register at TPB's sister site; https://forum.suprbay.org/index.php and mods will investigate.  Just keep in mind that these fake ass uploaders usually come out almost every day.  Either yesterday or the day before I came to look for new releases and literally the first 7 pages were all fake uploads with 10,ooo+ fake seeders.  With that said, the mods have quite a lot of shit to shovel and reaction may not be immediate."

,some-young-guy,2013-06-21T13:20Z,I'm just glad someone leaks these great quality ones.  they are so much better than cams.
[V],simon200,2013-06-21T18:56Z,"professorjpj stop showing the world just how stupid you are, do you think if the loader had a copy without hardcoded subs he wouldn't release it
This is an R6 witch means it comes from asia with the hardcoded subs so they can understand what's being said, you can of course take take this torrent and blur out all the subs repost it here and then everyone will be happy if not STFU"
[V],simon200,2013-06-21T19:16Z,This link to his other copy of this torrent is much better
