Full Moon Fever (1994) [DVDRip]

There's something mysterious about a full moon. Some say it tends to bring out the loneliness in people. Those who are alone pine over the ideal lover they've never had, while others yearn for the touch of the imperfect lover they've lost. Then there are those who think a full moon is magic ... it's nocturnal light there solely to illuminate the path for lovers looking for each other. And yet, others swear that a full moon just makes people crazy. But maybe crazy is just another word for lust. Yeah, a full moon sure can play tricks on you ... especially where lust is concerned!
