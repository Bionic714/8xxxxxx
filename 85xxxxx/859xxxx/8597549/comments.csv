The audio is terrible, and the video while clear, has a really poor framerate."

,DrMD,2013-06-23T08:06Z,"This movie fuckin stinks, it's just one stupid ass scene after another, it's watchable though the sound sounds hollow and some lines are unintelligible. A=6 V=7 M=4, basically it's crap."
,fistanleydo,2013-06-23T09:15Z,"This is not a CAM. It is actually a really decent copy, the only problem is the Asian hardcoded subs that are easy to ignore."
,Sh0ckerElite,2013-06-23T15:33Z,"Good quality. 
Audio- 8 
Video-8 
 Movie was alright, something different. What would you do if you were a part of the purge? LOL"
,TomK405,2013-06-24T02:24Z,Not bad. Thank You. A/8 V/7 for r6?/cam.
,MyKrossini,2013-06-24T06:23Z,"Holy shit! What is wrong with you people? R6 as in REGION 6 DVD (not cam), as in obviously it's gonna have mother fucking Chinese subtitles because it's the mother fucking REGION 6 (CHINA) DVD RELEASE!!! And for you loud mouth ignorant fuck faces out there, the 6th DVD region is exclusive to China. PLEASE STOP POINTING OUT THE OBVIOUS FACT THAT IT HAS CHINESE SUBTITLES. That is made abundantly clear by the big R6 in the torrent name. If you can't handle them, then wait for the R1 release and shut the fuck up. Fuck salt! "
,asusurma,2013-06-24T11:54Z,"Great movie, i loved the plot! Quality wasn't so great :( i found a better one at movie.smkdki.org and it worked perfectly for me!"
