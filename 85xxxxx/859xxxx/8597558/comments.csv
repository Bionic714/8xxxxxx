,jalucian,2013-06-22T00:16Z,"I believe those are both re-releases of some kind, because both have been available in 720p for a year or two, but there are no torrents with relatively small file sizes, so I'll put them on the to-do list. Thanks for the request."
,jalucian,2013-06-22T15:15Z,"There's already a Kingdom release of 48 Hrs in 1080p that's only 3gigs, which isn't too much bigger than what I would do, so I'll probably skip that one. But I'll go ahead and do Trading Places. Just do a search for 48 Hrs 1080p Kingdom."
