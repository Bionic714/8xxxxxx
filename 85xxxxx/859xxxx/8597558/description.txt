Notes:

Another highly controversial movie by Larry Clark (maker of Kids (1995)). After looking at all the other torrents of Bully I could find, this one is the highest quality (based on encoding settings and video bitrate), highest resolution, and the only one with subtitles. All of the external subtitles for Bully I could find in .srt format were terribly incorrect or out of synch, so I encoded the retail subs straight from the DVD itself, both English and Spanish, soft-coded. It was never released on blu-ray, so there are no HD sources, however, I cranked up the bitrate enough that if you full-screen it, the quality will be very good. In fact, I compared playing the DVD itself on a 26" screen to my encode full-screened on the same screen, and the encode is actually much better than DVD quality. Quite a testament to how good x264 really is when it comes to de-blocking and smoothing. If you like Bully, see also my encode of Larry Clark's Kids (1995):
