I've downloaded 5 different uploads of The Purge, this is the only watchable copy on TPB. 

A/V is in sync. Colour is good. None of the film is cut off. Not blurry at all.
Only thing is the Chinese subtitles, but they're small & easy to ignore.

M7 - different to what I expected from the trailer.

Thanks for the great upload!"
