Femap - independent of CAD pre-and post-processor from Siemens PLM Software for engineering analysis of the finite element method (FEM) (Finite Element Analysis - FEA). This means that Femap is the link between the user and problem solver - the core of performing calculations in problems of engineering analysis. System Femap, integrated with solver NX Nastran, is based on Microsoft Windows, is a product line Velocity Series and is an independent full-featured environment for modeling, simulation and evaluation of the results of the analysis of product.
Femap 11.0.1 system based solver NX Nastran v8p5 allows: an analysis of the dynamics and strength of structures, machinery and equipment, to receive the solution of unsteady nonlinear three-dimensional problems, problems in the mechanics of composites and composite structures, construction technology and mechanics, heat transfer analysis to obtain the solution of problems gas and fluid mechanics of multi-disciplinary tasks.
