Oz The Great And Powerful HD Bluray Rip  X264 English AC3 Audio

When Oscar Diggs, a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks that fame and fortune are his for the taking, that is until he meets three witches, Theodora, Evanora and Glinda, who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone has been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the enormous problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity, and even a bit of wizardry, Oscar transforms himself not only into the great and powerful Wizard of Oz but into a better man as well.
