,garycarradine,2013-06-24T10:19Z,cgculpepper: i've downloaded the dvd of to have and have not (colorized). ofcourse this is not originally a dvd but only form a tv rip converted to dvd. since it is dual audio with russian how can I removed the russian audio? is it possible? because i can only removed othe audios if it is originally a dvd. but this one is not originally dvd but from tv rip to dvd. but it just so happens that a have another dvd of that film in black & white. And im thinking of using that english audio to dubbed the colorized version. Now is that also possible? Are there any software that can do that? hope to hear from you soon :))
