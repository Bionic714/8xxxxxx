Dellec is merely one man caught up in a blur of immorality, yet his quest is clear - destroy the forces of evil where they flourish - and even places where the lines of good and evil are not easily defined. Following a tragic set of circumstances leading to his wife's murder at the hands of a malevolent Demi-God named Tera, our hero lands headfirst into the battle between good and evil - and his chances for survival are grim.
