Another Century's Episode 2 (πéóπâèπé╢πâ╝πé╗πâ│πâüπâÑπâ¬πâ╝πé║πé¿πâöπé╜πâ╝πâë 2 Anaz─ü Senchur─½zu Epis┼ìdo Tsu?), abbreviated as A.C.E.2, is a third-person mecha action video game produced by Banpresto and developed by From Software. It is the sequel to the popular 2005 game Another Century's Episode. It was released for the Sony PlayStation 2 on March 30, 2006.

A.C.E.2 is not a direct sequel to its predecessor, as it involves its own original plot, as well as covering events that already happened in A.C.E., albeit differently. This is not an unusual occurrence, as Banpresto has done this with most entries in the Super Robot Wars franchise; most of the games in that series are not connected by an established continuity (exceptions include the Super Robot Wars Alpha games and the titles in the Super Robot Wars Classic Timeline), with remakes or updates abounding.

However, there are some links back to A.C.E. in the sequel. The Ark series, including the main character's Gunark, use as their power source the super-volatile substance E2, which was introduced in the first game. Additionally, most of the A.C.E. original enemies return, this time with a backstory, while in A.C.E. they were simply there to add to the challenge. -Wikipedia

from jdhthegr8- this is my first index on TPB, so please bear with me if I seem to be doing things wrong or differently from other uploaders. Let's hope this works, because I had a hell of a hard time finding this file and only as a direct download. Figured it would be good to index this difficult find here so hopefully it can stay alive! Just extract the .7z file with any supported program and then you'll have the iso.
