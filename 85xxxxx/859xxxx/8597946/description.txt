The first 50 pages of this collection feature a new Allred 'Madman' story that's about twenty pages long, followed by a bunch of one-page stories (and one two-pager) from some of the biggest names in alternative comics (Peter Bagge, Kyle Baker, Peter Milligan, Dave Cooper, Gilbert, Jaime and Mario Hernandez, Erik Larsen, David Mack, Paul Pope, Eric Powell, Frank Quietly, Jeff Smith, Matt Wagner, Shannon Wheeler and more!). The next 200 pages contains a gallery with Madman illustrations from more people than you could possibly imagine. Really, it's quite an incredible list of artists. Far too many to name here.
