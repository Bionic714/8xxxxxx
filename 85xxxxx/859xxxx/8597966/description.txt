'Toys In The Basement'

Fantagraphics Books, 2010, 36 pages

Written and Illustrated by Stephane Blanquet

A creepy kids' book from a French comics master. With appearances in such anthologies as Zero Zero, BLAB! and Kramers Ergot, Stephane Blanquet has been delighting and terrifying American readers with his superslick, ultradetailed creepiness. So it makes perfect sense that his first graphic novel to be published in the U.S. would be... a children's book? Yes indeed. A warped mash-up of Toy Story and Where the Wild Things Are. The bright colors, jagged panels and irregular lettering make for a hallucinogenic experience, as if you're lurching through a lurid nightmare during an intense fever.
