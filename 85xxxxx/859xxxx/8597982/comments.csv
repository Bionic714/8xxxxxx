,meridjal,2013-06-21T17:31Z,Thanks
,1220,2013-06-21T19:19Z,"Wait... how is this 2013, when IMDb shows it to be 2011?"
,arildus,2013-06-21T19:24Z,Thanx:)
,Lurchk,2013-06-21T19:56Z,It is also not a movie. It's from the short-lived Tv series.
,zatara04,2013-06-21T20:09Z,Thanks HeroMaster!already downloading
,SkallaEnSvan,2013-06-21T23:37Z,ScottyD7421 I hate people like you that can't use their own brains to use some simple logic before asking.. Maybe it's at the top 100 because people think it's a new movie and just click and dl retard..
,ScottyD7421,2013-06-22T01:49Z,"@SkallaEnSvan, my comment served the purpose of politely letting people know that this isn't a movie and is in fact episode 6 of season 1. Your comment is typical of the thousands of trolls who use this site to spread hate by leaving vile & abusive or comments to people they don't know and will never meet. 

Cheers for your thoughts though, however wasted they may be."
,TotalLoser,2013-06-22T02:01Z,"Whoa,  relax SkallaEnSvan.  Maybe everyone just got excited because it's not a CAM video.  I'd download paint drying 4 right now if it was a dvdrip..."
,chewy446,2013-06-22T04:58Z,"TotalLoser....I wouldn't do that if I were you. Paint drying 1,2 and 3 need to be viewed first or you will just be lost and confused by 4"
,SkallaEnSvan,2013-06-22T07:47Z,ScottyD7421: Lets hope.
,SkallaEnSvan,2013-06-22T07:50Z,"Sorry, it's not my typical pattern to engage those of low IQ in discussion, it won't happen again."
,twatable,2013-06-22T13:50Z,"SkallaEnSvan, you're a twat."
,xolido,2013-06-22T17:07Z,Meeh why is this on Top 100 ?
,trezay,2013-06-22T22:01Z,"come on guys, 0- 19kb/s?

,hydraklaff,2013-06-23T01:42Z,"This was a major mindfuck for me. 

Was looking for imdb-link, but couldnt find good croc, bad croc, because i was looking for the one with jack black, wich doesnt exist.

turns out that Mick Wingert from imdb has a perfect imitation of jack black. and there is no trailer because its a miniserie.

BAT OMG, good old bender is playing the croc, Frickin love that guy."
,GrouchoMX,2013-06-23T02:18Z,The animations are TERRIBLE. It's definitely not like in the movies if you think so. It's so awkward watching with so low quality.
,pinutu,2013-06-23T05:02Z,thanks dude what about the croods
,HKCannibal,2013-06-23T08:38Z,Thanks a lot!
