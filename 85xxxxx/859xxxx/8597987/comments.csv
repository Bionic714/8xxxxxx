,HHLS,2013-06-21T21:39Z,Thank you! I'd appreciate it if you uploaded any other erotic/adult comics you have. It's really difficult to find any of those any more. Much appreciated!

[V],LeonardTSpock,2013-06-23T20:33Z,"Y'all are most welcome. HHLS, the thing is, I don't actually collect the adult book. Not in digital or physical form. The few adult books that I've uploaded are part of my collection because I'm a completist to a fault. When I decide that I really like a writer or artist I want to check out EVERYTHING they've done. A few of them have done an adult book along the way, which is why I have those in the collection. Also, I've kind of carved out my own little niche here at TPB and I'm not sure I want to become the ""adult"" comic book guy (not just directing this at you, either - several people have requested the same thing). That being said, I do have access to a lot of adult books, so I'll have to think on it a bit before I make a final decision. Maybe after I've uploaded everything else I have planned I could do a round of adult stuff. Not sure."
