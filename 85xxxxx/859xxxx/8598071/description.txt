Cornettist Rob Mazurek is some kind of a musical genius. He has played
everything from bop over rock to weird avant-garde, yet at the same time he
managed to create several musical styles that can be called his own, and good
ones at that.

His new album, released on an obscure Brazilian label, country where he now
resides, is again an absolute feast for the ears and mind. We find back the
broad cinematic sweeping themes of the Exploding Star Orchestra, but then in a
kind of musical collage, with sounds upon sounds perfectly mixed changing the
background for the joyful cornet solos like a kaleidoscope, ever changing, and
all that with odd meters and changing tempi.

As one of the originators of the post-rock of Isotope 217 and Tortoise, we also
find back these rock-based elements, yet sometimes closer to the mad rhythmic
subtleties of the Penguin Caf√© Orchestra ("Purple Sunrise"), with lots of
Brazilian influences. The music is a times incredibly dense, with many
instruments mixed together, but you also get the other extreme of
light-textured duos or solos, including a wonderfully sweet guitar and cornet
duet, that will move to tears, as its title suggests...
