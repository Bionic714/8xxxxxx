RELEASE NOTES
When technology meets Cthulhu
Magrunner: Dark Pulse is an action-puzzle game in which technology
confronts the Cthulhu Mythos, as imagined by author, H. P. Lovecraft.
You are Dax, one of seven Magrunners selected among the elite to
participate in MagTech CorporationΓÇÖs space training program.
But, what should be the chance of a lifetime quickly becomes a
horrific nightmare.

Equipped with your Magtech glove, you must harness the ability to
magnetically polarize and manipulate objects in the environment to
survive and surpass challenging puzzles. Your reflexes and ingenuity
will be pushed to their limits as you make your way through 40
immense and dangerous levels, including high-tech training rooms
and the endless chasms of the lost cosmos, on a path to confront
the horrendous creatures of Cthulhu
