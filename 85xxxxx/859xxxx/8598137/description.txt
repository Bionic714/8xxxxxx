War Documentary hosted by Jaime Lee, published by SBS in 2011 - English narration


Information
------------------------------

Singapore is a cosmopolitan world city ┬û an Asian Tiger ┬û that plays a key role in international trade and finance with a population of close to 5 million people. But 70 years ago its citizens suffered one of the most bitter and brutal campaigns of WW2. The fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 brought an empire to its knees, dramatically changing the destiny of millions of people. It was a crushing defeat that unleashed national Asian independence movements, and Asian, Australian and British aspirations were never the same. 
Shot in key locations, the documentary includes first-hand accounts of events from surviving soldiers, airmen and nurses from the front line. Fundamental to the documentary are civilian Malaysian and Singaporean eyewitnesses.
