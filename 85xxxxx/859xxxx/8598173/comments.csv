[V],simon200,2013-06-21T18:57Z,"Cheers ronnie_88BOT  for directing us to a better copy, have your 1st 1 from WOOD will DL this and get back with a comparison "

A 8
V 8 for an R6 good copy and yes it does have hardcoded subs
Again cheers dude"
,maverickbleh,2013-06-21T19:10Z,"No one cares about your fucking torrent wars, just comment on the quality dammit. It's not high school anymore."
,maverickbleh,2013-06-21T19:12Z,"That was for zero423, sorry everyone else. Looks like a good copy. Downloading and seeding right away!"
,socker34,2013-06-21T20:40Z,"A 8 
V 6"
,Aaronomous,2013-06-21T20:41Z,"Ok so I made an account just for this, Anyone who cares as much as I about getting the best copy don't bother looking anywhere else this one is perfect aside from the korean (I think?) subs. I only did a quick scan through this and the best R6 mind you, But I think it had less korean BS on the screen in the first few minutes as well.. And sorry I don't bother with the A/V numbers its either good enough quality to watch or its garbage IMO"
,Aaronomous,2013-06-21T20:49Z,"BTW Simon200 Said it even better But he Hadn't commented when I went to make an account n stuff :P, BTW forgot to mention Zero423 is a complete moron!"
,MalikeW,2013-06-21T21:28Z,"This is legit, no stuttering frame rate and the audio is fine and in sync. solid 8/8, thanks upper, nice job."
,phixi3,2013-06-22T00:36Z,"thanks

V: 6/10 (almost 7)
A: 8/10 (almost 9)

harcoded subs are annoying (especially if using other external subtitles for another language) but I'm not complaining"
,Dankaru81,2013-06-22T04:20Z,@zero423: how the f**k is your crappy internet his problem. Why don't you stfu and kill yourself.
,shanef420,2013-06-22T04:59Z,how do u play this file???
[T],ronnie_88BOT,2013-06-22T05:17Z,use a VLC or Windows Media players. that should work
,komaxlaredo,2013-06-22T05:19Z,video = 9 audio = 9  subtitulos chinos pegados. hardcoded chinese subs. great quality thanks uploader.
,GT5xp,2013-06-22T05:43Z,Your Torrent sucks. Don't advertise on other peoples shit. Especially saying that your torrent is better. Douchebag.
,GT5xp,2013-06-22T05:47Z,"Re-read the comments and now I need to put my foot in my mouth :( . Sorry about the earlier insults, I just hate when people spam other files with links to theirs. This copy is better and OP is not the spamming douchebag that I thought he was. 

A/8
V/8"
,gozinya,2013-06-22T07:49Z,"Absolutely worth watching, good quality for a web DL if you don't mind looking past the Korean subs (for free). The movie itself is definitely a good one...Thanks!"
,Staffieone,2013-06-22T11:51Z,"Watchable, the subtitles are hard coded but at least for me after a while you forgot they are there.

Audio and Video quality were better then expected for a web download.

"
[T],ronnie_88BOT,2013-06-22T16:15Z,"@GT5xp, FYI both are my torrents and i wasnt advertising anything. i was just merely pointing out that this scene is better than that scene so next pls noobs dont cuss n harass uploaders for whatever reason :) we are providing content for free. learn how to at least give some credit. "
,Nerwo,2013-06-22T19:19Z,"Awesome, thanks!"
,h2kkiller,2013-06-22T20:31Z,"Many thanks for this! Quality is awesome and audio is as well! Pretty much a DVDRiP in my eyes!
A - 8
V - 8.5"
,dollymadison123,2013-06-23T00:37Z,"Great Copy!  I'd say A:10, V:9 and a 9 only because there's Chinese subs hard coded.  Other than that it's as good as a DVD copy.  The Movie, on the other hand is frustrating. So many STUPID Moves being made!   If my kid performed such bone head moves, I'd slap the $#!+ out of him!
I found myself yelling at the TV!
Thanks for the great upload!"
,H20YouDoin,2013-06-23T06:17Z,"Impressive quality for such a new movie, those subtitles can be kinda distracting but overall, not too bad.  Entertainment Weekly gave this a C-, haven't watched yet, just browsed.

V-7
A-7
M- dunno yet.... "
,fuckyourbullshit,2013-06-23T20:08Z,"Decent all around. Quality like an old dvd rip.
Like the hunger games, if you're a teenager who hasn't seen any movies like this then you should enjoy it. 
A bit predictable and repetitive for more experienced viewers [used VLC's ""skip 10 seconds"" button quite a lot]. Adelaide Kane is a nice bonus."
,Hunibuni,2013-06-24T01:26Z,"For everyone complaining about ronnie_88BOT posting on other torrents, please pay attention to the name.
