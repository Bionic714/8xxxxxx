,lapis22,2013-06-21T19:24Z,"Hovind rejects the age of the earth, the field of astronomy, denies the entire field of geology, and is utterly confused by physics and/or radiometric dating (Or more likely, purposely distorting all those fields). He has a dismal grasp of pretty much every field of scientific study, and apparently little to no concern for factual accuracy. Just one tiny example among far too many to list: Hovind argues against 'evolution' by trying to discredit the Big Bang. In one such diatribe, known affectionately as Mister Hovind and the Professor, he explains that the Big Bang violates the conservation of angular momentum because [paraphrasing] ""If everything came from a tiny spinning dot that blew up then everything would spin in the same direction ... since some planets and moons in our solar system exhibit retrograde motion/rotation ... this disproves the Big Bang ... so evolution is impossible"".

For those of you familiar with the relationship between the Big Bang and the solar system, you understand the stunning conflation and dishonesty in that statement. For those who are not, basically it's about as accurate as saying something like ""The atomic bomb was a tiny spinning dot that blew up, and since it was spinning in one direction, the debris produced had to spin the same way ... so global warming is impossible"""
