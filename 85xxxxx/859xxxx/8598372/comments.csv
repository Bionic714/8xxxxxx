,TPBWhore,2013-06-21T23:01Z,Thanks for the up. Any chance of the infinitely better 2008 Incredible Hulk movie in 1080?

Thanks for the upload."
,TPBWhore,2013-06-22T07:35Z,"A decent cast maybe, but poorly written, very anti-climactic, and the CG was nowhere near as good (the Hulk looks more like a pissed off Shrek rather than the Hulk). Not to mention that this particular movie was not canonical or true to the Marvel universe or the Hulk character (likely because Stan Lee had virtually zero input on this one).

I suppose Marvel cancelled filming of the sequel because it was so good? Actually, they completely scrapped all thoughts of a sequel after only its 2nd week in theaters. I guess it was so good that, between it's 1st & 2nd week, ticket sales dropped 70% because of word of mouth reviews? I guess the 2008 reboot did $20 billion more in ticket sales because this one was better? I guess this one was better because it flopped in China, Mexico, & Russia while the 2008 reboot broke box office records in those same countries?

Seriously?

lol to each his own I guess."
