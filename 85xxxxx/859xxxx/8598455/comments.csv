,rachleigh1989,2013-06-22T04:42Z,You have the best torrents that I have found!  Thank you so much!  Can you please do Center Stage?  I can't find it anywhere!  Thanks again!!!
,lumega,2013-06-22T09:27Z,From 3:09 to 3:23 the video and sound stops and then same again from 3:37 and continue's for ages.. This has never happened to me before with YIFY don't know if its his or my end..

,Huselan,2013-06-23T03:13Z,"Unless YIFY comes back to re-seed, I think this torrent is DOA. Everyone's stuck at 75%.

YIFY has an earlier Jumanji 720p torrent. Might have better luck with that one.
