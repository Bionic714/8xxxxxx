Cold, shivering and numb, Aaron crouches on a steep fire-escape, hoping and praying as a bullet speeds his way. His body freezes up but his mind races on through the thick jungle of his memories. He sees everything, his entire life flashing before his eyes. The highs, the lows, the heart breaks, and the many capricious twists and turns of his short existence. It takes him all the way from his childhood in a troubled suburban household in Accra, Ghana, West Africa-- to living dead broke on the streets of New York City, surrounded by a slanted range of characters in which fucked-up company he fits in almost too perfectly.
A turbulent testosterone fueled tale ensues in the shadows of his mind that puts his past in perspective and reshapes his disposition and views as his life comes to an inevitable end.
