Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy and inspired by the Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron comics, the game takes place primarily between events in the films Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The player controls Luke Skywalker, commander of the elite X-wing pilots known as Rogue Squadron. As the game progresses, Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fight the Galactic Empire in sixteen missions across various planets.

1) Mount/Burn image file.

2) Install the game.

NOTE: Inspite of the game giving you the option of creating a shortcut,
more often then not, it won't, so go to the install DIR & make a shortcut of the, "Rogue Squadron"exe. or start the game from the drive.

3) Keep the ISO mounted, or CD in the tray. There are "No-CD" patches for this game on the net, but I would bother with them, they cause more harm than good, this works perfectly on Windows 7 32bit, 
I have not tested this on 64bit.

4) This game is Xbox360 gamepad compatible, but not all buttons are mapped; to use Xbox360 gamepad with better mapped keybindings, use xpadder, and load my 
"Rogue Squadron 3D (Xbox360)" profile from the "Game Profiles" folder

5) Start the game, create a profile, setup your prefered graphics config and off you go.

6) Enjoy
