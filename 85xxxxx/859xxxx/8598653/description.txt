Billie (aka ΓÇ£DucatiΓÇ¥) is known as much for her extraordinary beauty as for the sexy yellow Ducati motorcycle she rides through the mean streets of Los Angeles. Tough, talented, and self-assured, BillieΓÇÖs used to doing things her way - but that was before love threw an oil slick in the road and spun her life into chaos. BillieΓÇÖs first problem is simple: SheΓÇÖs pregnant. Her second problem is that her lover, Keith, is still married. Keith has some ΓÇ£thingsΓÇ¥ to deal with, and the people in his life are dark and duplicitous enough to take matters into their own hands, determined to keep Billie from having her baby. Billie suddenly finds herself confronted, attacked, run off highways, threatened, and shadowed. Keith still has ties to his manipulative wife, Carmen, and he adores his fifteen-year-old daughter, Destiny. Will he do the right thing by his new family, or stand by his old one? Soon all eyes shift as everyone finds themselves desperately chasing Destiny, a troubled and deceptive girl dancing on the edge of womanhood. When the rubber meets the road, all the madness with Billie, Carmen, and Keith comes to a head. EveryoneΓÇÖs fighting dirty for what they want . . . and theyΓÇÖre all willing to destroy their enemy or go down in flames to get it.
