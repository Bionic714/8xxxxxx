Share Me (One Night with Sole Regret 0.5)
by Olivia Cunning

Please note: This erotic novelette was originally released in an anthology entitled A Very Naughty Xmas. If you have already purchased the anthology, there is no new content in this stand-alone novelette.

After a benefit concert, Lindsey longs to spend an amazing Christmas Eve with her favorite band, Sole Regret, to thank them for their generosity. Even though she followed their tour bus up a slick mountain pass during a blizzard, she never expected to spend an entire snowy night with two generous rock stars who love to share their gifts. Trapped on a tour bus with her best friend, a rock band, and the bus driver, what can these naughty ladies possibly do to keep warm? Perhaps a better question is what won't they do?

Contains a whole lot of kinky antics. Sensitive readers, beware.
