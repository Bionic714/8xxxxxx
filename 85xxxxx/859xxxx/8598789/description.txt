In this series of lessons, we will be taking an introductory look at the MoGraph toolset found in CINEMA 4D.


We will begin by learning how to utilize Cloners, which we use
to populate our scenes with a variety of objects. From there, we will
learn how to use effectors for controlling the behavior of clones and
other objects, we will learn how to control the color and shading of our
various clones, we will learn how to incorporate dynamics into our
MoGraph objects, as well as many other topics that will help you to
become familiar with MoGraph and give you a glimpse into some of the
creative possibilities this tool provides us.
