In this CINEMA 4D tutorial, we will provide you with a good
understanding of how to work within CINEMA 4D. You will learn from
several of the instructors here at Digital-Tutors, as we go through many
of the major parts of the software, and help you become a more
effective CINEMA 4D artist. We will begin our training by exploring the
user interface, and discussing a number of features and concepts that
will be very important to know as we start to delve deeper into the
software. From this point, we will walk step-by-step through the process
of modeling and texturing our own futuristic flying vehicle using
CINEMA 4D and the built-in BodyPaint texturing suite. We will also guide
you through the entire process of rigging this vehicle for movement,
and then animating the takeoff and flying sequence for this project.
From there, we will learn how to use the standard CINEMA 4D particle
system to create realistic steam for the refueling hose of our aircraft,
and we will guide you through the process of setting up the lights,
shadows, and using many rendering features in CINEMA 4D to finish out
this whole project. Finally, we will finish this CINEMA 4D tutorial by
taking you through MoGraph, an extremely powerful toolset in CINEMA 4D
that will allow you to create highly complex, very detailed motion
graphics with minimal effort.
