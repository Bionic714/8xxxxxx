[T],penfag,2013-06-22T03:20Z,"@iss3210 - You should post your wants on the SuprBay forum devoted to book requests.  Be sure to include all the relevant publication info (title, author, publisher, date).

See http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51

@freight2 - I'm sorry but the PDF is all I've got.  I expect the EPUBS will eventually turn up."

[T],penfag,2013-06-22T22:46Z,@ningzhi - I don't have the Harold Bloom book you mention -- I've uploaded pretty much everything I have -- but you should try requesting the book in the SuprBay forum mentioned in the post above.
