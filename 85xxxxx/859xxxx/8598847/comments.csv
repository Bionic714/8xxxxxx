[V],Nepotu,2013-06-23T00:16Z,"Thank you, all, for your great words! I'll try to find some of your requests, but no promises. Because of the variety of versions required (540p, 720p, 60fps, 1080i), there is a huge amount of torrents to process them and I have no time to search older game. Also, I have a shitty bandwidth (to upload my own torrents it takes days to make some serious seeders). Anyway, I want to thank you for your support! Cheers, brothaz!"
