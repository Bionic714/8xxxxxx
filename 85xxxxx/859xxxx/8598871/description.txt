Recorded right after the end of Gigantour 1 in Buenos Aires, Argentina on October 9, 2005. This is it kids, the ultimate Megadeth show! Megadeth are worshipped in Argentina and they played one night outside in front of a sea of fans. The set is awesome and contains 18 songs (including a rare performance of "I'll Be There"). It took me back to when I saw them for Gigantour in Sept. 2005 and 2006 in Montreal.
