Arcus will tell you when rain is going to fall within the hour, down to the minute, how long it'll rain for and how strong the rain will be.
"Heavy rain starting in 4 minutes, for the next 35 minutes".
Arcus uses the new Forecast.io (previously Dark Sky) API to get the most accurate, and most current weather information.
From the Dark Sky company website on their Data Sources : "Forecast.io is backed by a wide range of data sources, which are aggregated together statistically to provide the most accurate forecast possible for a given location."
