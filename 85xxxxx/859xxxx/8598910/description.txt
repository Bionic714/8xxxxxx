The original Battery Indicator for Android has been reborn with a new name, a new look, and new features! Battery Indicator Pro is now BatteryBot Pro.
BatteryBot shows automatic time-remaining estimates based on recent usage. As of version 8.0.10, Pro users can configure the predictions to be more or less sensitive to recent usage.
Three years ago I was an inexperienced computer geek who was disappointed that his Android phone couldn't easily show him his battery level. So I created the first status bar battery indicator for Android. I've continued to improve as a programmer and make minor improvements to the app ever since.
Now there are many other battery apps, several of which are also called "Battery Indicator". So I decided it was time to completely redesign the app to be more useful, more attractive, and easier to use. It seemed like a good time to rename the app to something unique.
Coming soon:
* Further modifications to the design
* Updated translations
* More configurability of the new features
* More and better icon plugins
* Graphs of the battery history
* More desktop widgets
* Configurability and resizability for desktop widgets
I've never really shared my business philosophy; this is and always has been how I see it:
1) Ads are annoying. For some apps, ads might make sense, but a system utility should not have ads.
2) The free version should be simple but useful; it shouldn't feel crippled.
3) Some people choose to purchase the Pro version because they want extra features, some because they want more customization, and many because they just want to say "thanks" for the free version.
