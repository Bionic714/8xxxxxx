ΓÇ£The Kingdom of Talingarde is the most noble, virtuous, peaceful nation in the known world. This is the story of how you burned this insipid paradise to the ground. ItΓÇÖs only fair. They burned you first.

They condemned you for your wicked deeds. They branded you. They shipped you to the worst prison in the kingdom. In three days, you die. In three days, the do-gooders pray theyΓÇÖll be rid of you.

TheyΓÇÖve given you three days. The fools, thatΓÇÖs more than you need to break out. And then, it will be their turn to face the fire.ΓÇ¥
