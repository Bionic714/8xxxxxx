READ THIS FIRST!
THERE IS NO README INCLUDED IN THE TORRENT.

This is no standard .mkv.
It was encoded by myself, using a 10bit codec, meaning the filesize has been reduced dramatically, and quality is close to lossless.
However, to play these videos, you need a media player which is capable of playing 10bit encodes. VLC Media Player is compatible on Windows (tested myself), just make sure you have the latest version.
It is not compatible with many devices.

If this upload goes well, I might as well upload my other 10bit encodes.

You can use these to keep and save space on your hard drive.
