The film was a pet project of Darryl F. Zanuck and was meant to make a star of his mistress, Bela Darvi. Peter Ustinov, in a performance he'd largely repeat in ""Spartacus"" and Jean Simmons are rather good, and the sets and costumes are brilliant. And so is the musical score - long remembered after the film's demise - as a once-in-lifetime collaborations between two of the Golden Era's great - Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Newman. This appears to be from the Twilight Time limited edition of 3000 (offered in DVD and Blu-Ray) put out last year, which looked very good considering the 60-year-old source material. "
