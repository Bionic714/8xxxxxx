I'm not to familiar with the DICKS series, and I dont know if you're pulling my leg or not about it either but I'll look for it regardless. If it's something intresting I'll definately upload it but it's not something I would really find myself I may not put it up here. and no problem!

@STFmaryville

Hey thanks, I appreciate that! and no problem."
,unnim2,2013-06-22T05:43Z,thank you. great upload.

No problem, more uploads on the way soon."
,binderguy1,2013-06-22T13:29Z,"Actually, no I'm not pulling your leg.
There's actually a bunch of minis and one-shots with the title DICKS.  Written by Ennis and drawn by John McCrea.
Mostly published by Caliber and Avatar.
Gross-out and rude humor Ennis style.  :-)"

I've looked it up and It doesn't look like something I would be into, I dont get into comedy comics too much, but I can request for it on a site I normally go to and hopefully they can locate it! 

There are multiple series so it may take weeks or even a month for them to find it, but If I do only get one or two of the series I'll just upload them individualy!"
