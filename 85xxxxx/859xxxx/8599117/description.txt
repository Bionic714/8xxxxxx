Spiral Zone [1987] , Complete 65 episodes from original DVDs.

I like all the other spiral zone fans bought the dvdset from spiral-zone.com (thanks a lot to C.Storm for his wonderful efforts). So since the production of the dvdsets have stopped, i thought why not share it with the rest of the world ,i mean that is why Bram Cohen invented the "BitTorrent" (thanks a lot Bram, God bless you).

Please seed this for as long as possible as there are millions out there who wanna relive the spiral zone fever.

Cheers goes goes to all human beings who believe "sharing is caring".
