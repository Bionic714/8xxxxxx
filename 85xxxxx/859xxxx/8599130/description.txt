Aram Khachaturian (June 6 [O.S. May 24] 1903 – May 1, 1978) was a Soviet
Armenian composer. Alongside Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich,
Khachaturian is sometimes called one of the three "titans" of Soviet music.
Khachaturian's works were often influenced by classical European music and
Armenian folk music.
