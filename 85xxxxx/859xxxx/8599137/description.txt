Francisco de Assis França (March 13, 1966 - February 2, 1997), better known as Chico Science, was a Brazilian singer and composer and one of the founders of the Mangue Beat cultural movement. He died in a car accident in 1997 in Recife, Pernambuco, at the age of 30. He became the lead singer and major creative driving force of the groundbreaking Mangue Bit band called Chico Science & Nação Zumbi (CSNZ). Influenced by such musicians as James Brown, Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow, their music cleverly fused rock, funk, and hip hop with maracatu and other traditional rhythms of Brazil's Northeast. Chico had a powerful stage presence that was compared by some to that of Jimi Hendrix.
