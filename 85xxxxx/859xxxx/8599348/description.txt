Total Recall Call Recorder for the Samsung Galaxy S2 (SII), & Galaxy S3 (SIII) & Galaxy S4 (SIV) | Full Version

Unlike other Call Recorders on the Market that simply record audio from your Microphone (at low volumes) Total Recall is designed for TRUE call recording, which results in full audio from both sides of the call on compatible devices. The quality difference is extremely noticeable, especially under noisy conditions. When Call Recording is Mission Critical, there's only one Call Recorder professionals trust and that's Total Recall by Killer Mobile (R).
--------------------------------------------------------
This version of Total Recall Call Recorder is designed specifically for the following Android devices:
I9500 (Galaxy S4)
I9505 (UK S4)
i9300 (Global S3)
SCH-I535 (Verizon)

T989 (T-mobile Sprint Epic 4G Touch)
SPH-D710 (Sprint Galaxy S2)
HTC One X (Rooted, Nvidia Tegra Chipset Variants) * Use Strategy D
** NEW!! ** Now Recording on rooted S3's (most variants) running 4.1.1 & higher - Acccept the SU and Install prompt after installation. This will provide high quality call recording even while using a BT headset
* Galaxy S4 Users should use recording Strategy B | This has been confirmed for i9500 & i9505 users. Seems US based S4 users (which have a different chipset) are stuck with Mic based recording as usual
* Non-Rooted Galaxy S3 users that have been updated to Jellybean / OS 4.1.1 will currently only be able to record from the Mic. The 4.1.2 update for both the i9100 (S2) i9300 (S3) restores call recording without requiring root.

** Galaxy S2 users that have been updated to ICS / OS 4.0.3 will require root to restore full two-sided recording, however you can record from the Mic on non-rooted devices. OS 4.1.2 (Jellybean) restores call recording without requiring root)
