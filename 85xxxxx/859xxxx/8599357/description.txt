Camera 2 is the ultimate real-time effects app.
Take better pictures, amazing videos and have fun creating them.
Featuring many unique high quality effects, grouped into families sharing a common theme:
ΓùÅ Old Time: make your camera look like something from the 20's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's or 80's
ΓùÅ Lomos and Retro: everyone's favourite, from normal to sublime.
ΓùÅ Comic: to express yourself, half tone, B&W, printed comics, new style, mix and match
ΓùÅ Art: sometimes you just want to create a piece of art with a tap
ΓùÅ Sci-Fi: see it to believe it
ΓùÅ Computer: and finally, for every geek or nerd out there, this is unmissable. Old computer monitors
Many of the effects can be boosted by applying a superb "out of focus"/"depth of field" filter, and, as usual, it's all real time.

FAQ
ΓùÅ Why does the video recorder launch the default camera recording app?

ΓùÅ Can I save pictures/videos in my external storage?
- Not at the moment, but we plan to do this in the future.
ΓùÅ How can I see the pictures I've taken with Camera 2?
- For now you can only see the last picture/video you've created within the app, we plan to add a fully featured gallery but for the time being you will have to use the standard gallery app to see all pictures.
