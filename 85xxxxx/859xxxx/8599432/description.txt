The Official F1Γäó Timing and Track Positioning App is ideal both to complement the TV viewing experience and to keep those not viewing the race live, 
up- to- date with what is happening as it happens in the most comprehensive way possible.
NEW FEATURES INCLUDE: Tyre information, DRS Zones and Race Control Messages now added along with live F1Γäó news to your home screen direct from Formula1.com.
FULL FEATURE LIST INCLUDES:
Γÿà TYRE INFORMATION Γÿà
Find out which tyre type and compound any driver is on at any given time, visually represented via the Live Leaderboard timing screens. Understanding tyre selection is key to understanding how a race might unfold and is therefore a vital part of any F1Γäó race.
Γÿà DRS ZONES Γÿà
DRS (Drag Reduction System) Zones were new to F1 last year, meaning drivers could benefit from an additional aerodynamic advantage at a certain point on the track if they were close enough to attempt an overtaking manoeuvre. These activation zones are now clearly marked on the track maps and the detection point is also clearly marked.
Γÿà F1Γäó NEWS NOTIFICATIONS Γÿà

Throughout the year the App will alert you to all new F1Γäó news as it is issued by F1 via its official website. News can be pushed to your home screen so that you never miss an update or viewed in App, depending on your preference.
Γÿà REAL-TIME TRACK POSITIONING Γÿà
Displayed on our dynamic and fully interactive 3D map. You can see the position of every F1Γäó driver on the track at the same time. Pan, zoom and spin the track maps to focus on a specific driver or pull back to see the whole field. See the gaps and pit stops as never before!
Γÿà LIVE TIMING DATA Γÿà
Timing data is streamed direct from Formula One Management's technical centre at the race track to the palm of your hand. With multiple timing screens including sectors, gaps, speeds and interval data. Watch the sessions like the engineers on the pitwall!
