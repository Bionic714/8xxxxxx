Discover a peaceful forest teeming with wildlife and surrounded by natural beauty every time you use your device.
Sunlight filters through the trees as a gentle breeze rustles the leaves. Pause for reflection at the path while birds flutter past and deer graze contentedly in the rich foliage and quiet solitude of the undisturbed woods.
Choose the Natural theme, and your forest becomes pristine as you discover a cascading waterfall. Or, rest at your private cabin before setting out on a hike through the woods at the pathway signs - it's all up to you!
Interact with an owl or birds and watch the deer gaze at the forest. Customize the wildlife, flowers, cabin, signs, grass, waterfall, and much more!

Several optional add-on packs are also available for purchase, allowing you to choose the features most meaningful to you:

* The ΓÇÿCustomization PackΓÇÖ features even more personalization options such as your own text and images in the scene, dynamic time of day, fireflies at night, and more.
