DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVIE
--------------------------
This a slide show about Berlin City/ Germany, which created by me. Berlin is an interesting city. It's cold because of
the weather but actually it's not a cold as a city, warm and ready to embrace and embracing everybody, ready to give its
warmness.
See the both side in this slide show. The winter and spring side of the Berlin and feel its warmness, while watching it.

This piece of artwork mixed with my sweat, however you'll watch it in 8 minutes.

THANKS FOR WATCHING AND ENJOY .
