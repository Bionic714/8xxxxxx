Thanks for the upload!"
,zakimar5,2013-06-22T02:15Z,"""Inspired by true events"" means nothing. If the smallest detail can be found in common, they use that crappy term. So there may have been a monk who had to deliver something thousands of years ago - true inspiration."
,PetaFlux,2013-06-22T05:18Z,"Vikings never wore horned helmets.
Fucking idiots."
,piratewithalongpenis,2013-06-22T08:14Z,"lol @ petaflux    

the viking helmet pro

its a fucking movie, not everything is real in movies, did you know?"
,chernye,2013-06-22T10:37Z,"lol everyone knows that @piratewithalongpenis

however, Vikings wearing horned helmets are the second worst thing to use on any movie or documentary that is supposed to be ""inspired by true events"".
What a joke."
,arildus,2013-06-22T14:11Z,Thanx:)
,friherrekurre,2013-06-22T14:44Z,"@chernye
And the first is?..."
,itlivz,2013-06-23T00:28Z,^^ making a viking movie at all
,stitche5,2013-06-23T04:24Z,why do monks and priest's always have small dicks? trust me i know i was a catholic choir boy....
,astrolab,2013-06-23T07:59Z,"movie make with 100 dollars, no action, no story, no either actors, better forget it."
,dnos27,2013-06-23T08:31Z,I am a viking and i wear horned helmets. it sucks when a sword hits the end of a horn because it makes my helmet slide off sideways and the rest of the clan laughs at me.
,ironymon,2013-06-23T10:32Z,"There were horned helmets but they were decorative, and probably only the leader wore something like that."
,fuckyourbullshit,2013-06-23T16:56Z,"As soon as I saw the Viking in the horned helmet I knew two things: 
1. This movie would suck
2. There would be angry swedes raging about vikings never wearing horned helmets"
,M15f17,2013-06-23T17:10Z,"I do believe the helmets among the clans were know as ""Rape Hats"" that they only wore when they were ready to rape everyone. The most decorative were the best at raping."
,blankety-blank,2013-06-23T17:33Z,"lol... not one comment about the movie, but plenty of bs about the cover.

FWIW... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2320073/

even people who paid seem to find this a POS, no telling how good or bad this copy is yet but S4A does usually provide good or better than most. Thx for U/L"
,xpetiepiex,2013-06-23T20:46Z,Vikings did not slaughter and rape people. I swear to shit people are just getting dumber by the minute
,injun_mojo,2013-06-23T21:21Z,"terrible movie folks. good quality. really really bad movie.

unless you want to just waste an hr and half of your life...."
