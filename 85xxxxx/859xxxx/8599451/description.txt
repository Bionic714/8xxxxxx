Soft keyboard tailor-made for playing games. Play keyboard/gamepad-only games with touchscreen (e.g. Flash, Xperia Play or Onlive games), play touch-only games with physical gamepad (e.g. Street Fighter IV HD), or play touch/gamepad-only games with normal keyboard.
For any issue (e.g. initial setup problem, call up gamepad in games, config touchscreen control, enter cheat code in GTA) please contact developer at android.locnet@gmail.com

- OS-compatible USB keyboard/controller (e.g. XBox 360, generic keyboard, some generic controller) *

Software Compatibility
======================
This app is originally provided as an add-on for our emulators, but now works with many other apps. Not all apps are compatible, so please test during the trial period. For Motorola Bionic user, there is a ROM issue where many features only work with apps which are explicitly designed to work with soft keyboard.

For best compatibility we recommend using BluezIME-compatible controllers when physical controller is needed. Some compatibility issues can be solved with the help of root features, please contact us if you have problem.

How to call up GameKeyboard
===========================
Depends on device, ROM and target app there are many different ways to call up soft keyboard, e.g.:
- some apps have built-in option to call up soft keyboard
- some devices support using long pressing [Menu] key to call up soft keyboard
GameKeyboard also provide two methods in case the above cannot be used:
- switch to GameKeyboard Launcher, tap on the "call out keyboard after exit" button, then switch back
- turn on "Settings-&gt;[Vol. Up] Key Action" then use [Vol. Up] as hotkey
