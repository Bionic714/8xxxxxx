Convenient, extensible popup alerts for new SMS/MMS messages. Would you like to extend the functionality of Glowfly beyond text messages? Be sure to check out our growing selection of plugins and themes! Currently third party plugins are limited by time, resources and of course third party developer cooperation. If there is a third party app you would like to see, please feel free to contact us and let us know.
In order to get Glowfly to work with Google Voice, you will need to set Google Voice text messages to be sent and received within the SMS app. This option is found within the Google Voice mobile app.
**NOTE** - You will need to disable the system sms notifications in order to not receive multiple alerts.
"An ICS-themed SMS/MMS popup app - sign me up! So far I haven't seen anything even remotely as good-looking, even in the most popular SMS apps out there - they all seem cheesy and all over the place. Well done, Spiderfly Studios!" ~ Android Police
Thank you for your support and all the nice reviews! Reviewing the app helps us out a lot by giving us valuable feedback that lends to future development.
We have listened and always will listen to you. We are working hard to add the features you have requested and to improve the app in all aspects. If you are experiencing any errors with the app, find a possible bug or have questions on a feature, please email us or visit our Facebook/Google+ pages so we can assist you rather than simply leaving a low rating and negative comment. This is the only way we can help resolve any issues you may be experiencing. We cannot respond directly to comments in the Play Store. Thank you!
**TIP** We have now given Glowfly access to other apps. One great use of this is already built into Android. Simply go to your widgets/shortcuts and set a new direct message for a contact. When you click on that shortcut you can choose Glowfly. Doing so will bring up the quick reply window where you can send a quick message.
