DESCRIPTION OF THE MOVIE
--------------------------


Johnny Cash grew up in Arkansas, and served in the Air Force in Germany, where he bought a guitar. He returned from the war 
and married. Singing and playing with two other men, he cut a record in Memphis. His reputation growing from airplay and live 
performances, Cash became a star, touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis and others. On tour, he suffered the effects of 
drug addiction. He also met June Carter, who would later become his wife. Responding in part to the fan mail he received 
from prisoners, Cash played a legendary concert for the inmates at Folsom Prison in California.

Jonny Cash was a rebelion that changed the face of rock and roll. An outlaw before today's rebels were born and an icon no one
would ever forget. He did all this before turning 30.
WALK THE LINE explores the early years of the music legend, an artist, who transcended musical boundieres to touch people
around the globe.
