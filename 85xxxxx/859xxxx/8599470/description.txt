Questions:
1. What, exactly, is rooting? 
Rooting your Android phone is a process in which you gain administrative permission and have access to abilities of your phone that were unavailable before root. Therefore, you can install custom Android OS ROMs, clean system caches and rubbish, control apps auto start, and use GO Cleaner & Task Manager better.
2. How to add Widgets of GO Cleaner & Task Manager onto your home screen? 
Press Menu&gt; Choose "Add"&gt; Choose "Widget" or "GO Widget"&gt; Select the widget and the size you want.
3. Why I paid by google play but still cannot use PRO Version?
You might finish the payment process but Google cancelled the order and the money didn't transfer to our account. You may send us your payment ID, name, payment email to check payment process status.
Make sure you have signed on Google account (the same as your payment ID). This is the official way to identify the PRO Version users.
Make sure your network is connected. Google need to identify your account.
4.Why do apps restart again after killing?
Some apps are restarted by system events, Task killer cannot prevent the apps from restarting again without root permission. We suggest you to root your phone and Upgrade to PRO Version, Advanced Task Killer can prevent apps restart in the background and release more RAM to speed up your android device, even save more battery.
