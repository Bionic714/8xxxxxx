Following his strange trip to Minnesota, Graham is taken into custody by Crawford for the probable murder of Abigail Hobbs. They find her severed ear in his kitchen sink and her blood under his fingernails. Alana is left devastated by the arrest and is determined to find the cause of Graham's dementia, despite Crawford's insistence that there is no underlying cause. She has him draw a clock when he tells her that Dr. Lecter had him perform a similar test, and the results solidify her belief that there is a physical explanation for Graham's instability. Katz, Price and Zeller examine Graham's homemade fishing lures and discover that four of them have included elements of human remains, whose DNA matches all four victims of the copycat killer: Cassie Boyle, Marissa Schur, Dr. Sutcliffe and Georgia Madchen. Graham escapes from custody while being transferred and goes to Lecter for help, only to have Lecter demonstrate that it is feasible for him to have murdered all four people. Graham convinces Lecter to take him back to the Hobbs house in Minnesota, where he finally comes to realize that it was Lecter who called to warn Garret Jacob Hobbs about his impending arrest and that Lecter has been manipulating him ever since to see how someone with Graham's unique ability would operate. Crawford arrives and stops Graham from killing Lecter by shooting him in the shoulder. Graham is hospitalized, where his Encephalitis is finally discovered and he is placed in a protective coma while undergoing treatment. Lecter brings dinner to Du Maurier, where she reveals that she may know much more about him than even he suspected. Next, Lecter pays one last visit to Graham in his new home: the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane
