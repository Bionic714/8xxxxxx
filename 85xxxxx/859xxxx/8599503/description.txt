2011 Firefly/Serenity model for Orbiter 2010P1.  This ship was only available for a short time before being pulled, but it's such a nice representation I had to upload it.

Instructions:

Copy to your Orbiter directory.

Information on the Firefly, Shuttles, and Mule is in the "Firefly 2011.pdf" file in the root directory.  Keyboard commands are in the "(RTFnotes)" directory, and can also be accessed via the multifunction displays inflight.

Enjoy.
