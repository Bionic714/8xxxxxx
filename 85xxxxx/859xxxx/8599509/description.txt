Tired of Facebook not getting the attention it deserves on Android? HaxSync is the solution!
It provides perfect integration of Facebook data with your Android device. 
Here are just some examples of what it does:
ΓÇó	High-resolution contact images synchronized from Facebook. (up to 720x720 pixels on Jelly Bean!) Uses face-detection to get the cropping just right. 
ΓÇó	Touchable (opens the Facebook App or mobile Facebook site) status updates in Android's "People"-App, complete with like- and comment count; including thumbnails for picture posts and YouTube videos.
ΓÇó	Synchronization of Facebook Events (including attendee lists!) and/or birthdays into your device's calendar, including (optional) reminders.
To top it off, every feature is highly configurable and can be disabled if unwanted.
Don't like the way HaxSync cropped one of your contact images? Crop it yourself using the Contacts Manager. 
Want a different color for your calendars? Feel free to change it!
HaxSync is being actively developed, with new features and bugfixes arriving on a regular basis.
