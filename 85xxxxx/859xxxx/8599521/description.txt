NO SUBTITLES

American Pickers is an American reality television series that premiered on January 18, 2010, on History Channel.

The show follows Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz as they travel primarily around the greater Midwestern United States in a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, buying ("picking") antiques and collectibles. Danielle Colby-Cushman runs the office of Mike's business, Antique Archeology, from their home base in Le Claire, Iowa, and later at a second, newer location in Nashville, Tennessee (Frank sells what he acquires on his own website). The men go on the road, not only following up leads Danielle has generated, but also "free-styling," which is stopping at places that look like they might hold items worth buying. They also pick some places more than once.
