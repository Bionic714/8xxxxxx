The following statement should be completed if the shipment is valued at less than $2,500 (Canadian dollars) and signed by the Exporter in the beneficiary country where the goods were completed, and should be printed either on the Exporter's letterhead or on the commercial invoice for the shipment to which it relates. For the purposes of the General Preferential Tariff, not less than 60% of the ex-factory price of the goods must originate in one or more of GPT beneficiary countries or Canada."
