Everyone likes to geek out on their favourite records. Many a time-wasting fool's been gazing over the 'Yeezus' list of guest spots this past week. But it's unlikely you're going to remix a whole album out of sheer appreciation.

 That's unless you're Nico Jaar and Dave Harrington, aka Darkside. They've renamed their project "daftside" for the occasion, putting together their own version of Daft Punk's 'Random Access Memories'. It's called 'Random Access Memories Memories', which is a pretty tragic title until you consider all of the songs they've put together sound like distant, fragmented version of the originals; memories you can barely put your finger on. Quite clever, really.
