Canada Customs Invoice (PDF):  The NAFTA Certificate of Origin is used by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, including Puerto Rico, to determine if goods imported into their countries receive reduced or eliminated duty as specified by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
The NAFTA Certificate of Origin must be attached to an Invoice if the shipment is valued at greater than $2,500 (Canadian dollars).

Each shipment must be supplied with a commercial invoice or Canada Customs invoice. If the goods are dutiable a NAFTA Certificate of Origin is needed for duty
exemption for commercial shipments. It is the responsibility of the exporter (vendor) to issue and supply these documents.

Note for Canadian importers:
