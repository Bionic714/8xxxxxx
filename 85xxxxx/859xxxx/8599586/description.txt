My notes:

   When I found out this film became available quite recently I requested that my library get it.  Readers of these notes should do the same.  WUSA was one of those films that has stayed in my mind over all the years since I saw it in the theater.  With it's all-star cast and production quality plus subject matter WUSA deserves it's 10 star rating at IMDb.

   Why is this important?  If you are in the United States and listen to commercial radio, you will know.  WUSA presages what actually has happened to over the air media in the US.  It is the way films of social consciousness used to be made and have to be made again.

   Radio is the only truly democratic medium.  Setup of equipment is inexpensive.  Pirate Radio surfaces from time to time in many ways.  It is the medium of change to which everyone has access.  As I write this (in June of 2013)  1000 new Low Power Fm (LPFM) frequencies are being released in the US.  What remains to be seen is if these new LPFM outlets produce a new local-based alternative to right wing radio-- a new kind of WUSA.
