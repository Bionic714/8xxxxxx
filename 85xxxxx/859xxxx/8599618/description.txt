On behalf of my good friend (and developer of this game) Shaun Williams, I am uploading a torrent mirror for the alpha of his upcoming game, CDF Ghost Ship. It is a first/third person free roaming shooter set on a (seemingly) abandoned spaceship, the CDF Goliath. Without getting into too much, I will say that it's very fun. However there is a bit of a problem: The game has not been funded. Mr. Williams himself has devoted over 2.5k (2,500) hours into the creation of this game and there is still much more to go. The alpha allows you to play as only 1 of the characters, and four decks of the ship. The full game will feature 21 decks, 3 playable characters, and in addition to the full spaceship it will also include a colony and orbital station. The alpha also includes a Challenge Mode, where various challenges are offered to the player. The full game will also include an Arcade and Simulation mode, as well as Onslaught Mode, similar to popular "horde" modes of gameplay in other shooters. So, if you're as excited as I am for this game, please go to the website for it at http://www.cdfghostship.com/ and preorder or check out some screenshots of the gameplay, or if you'd like to directly support the game, go to http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cdf-ghostship and donate! Only YOU can make this game happen!
