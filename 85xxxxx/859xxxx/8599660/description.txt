The life of a hitman - pardon us, hitperson - seems intriguing and glamorous but it requires dedication and hard work. And an ability to withstand the sight of blood and grown men soiling themselves. So when the new girlfriend suggests it's time for a vacation, how could our hero argue?

Sure, he might need to do one more job before he takes off - gotta pay for that vacation somehow! - but then it's time for fun and sun right? Ah, if only the fates could conspire to leave a protagonist in peace, right?

In classic short story fashion, Shane Giroux makes his writing debut with a light, fun thriller with a last minute twist that you won't see coming. Well, maybe you will since we just told you about it, but don't let that stop you from buying this epic debut short story!

After all, the journey matters more than the destination.
