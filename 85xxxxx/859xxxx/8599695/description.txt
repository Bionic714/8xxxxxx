Canada Customs Invoice (PDF): The Regional Director General of CBSA may authorize a Form C6 in certain cases, such as to allow an importer or customs broker to open a parcel in a warehouse to get documents that are needed to release goods. The importer or customs broker should state on the form why permission is required before submitting it to the local CBSA office.

Each shipment must be supplied with a commercial invoice or Canada Customs invoice. If the goods are dutiable a NAFTA Certificate of Origin is needed for duty
exemption for commercial shipments. It is the responsibility of the exporter (vendor) to issue and supply these documents.

Note for Canadian importers:
Please direct your US vendors to this page where they can download the forms.
If they have any questions regarding the documents, they are welcome to contact us directly.
