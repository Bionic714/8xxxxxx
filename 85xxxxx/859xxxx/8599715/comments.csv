,olgagilow,2013-06-22T12:53Z,"i try to install RS 2 days already. i do everything what is written in the instructions, but after i installed a language package, i just get a gray screen.i can't even create an account. i can't do anything. it's not because of the torrent. I'm sure your torrent works fine for the rest. All other torrents have the same story... does somebody know what's wrong with my pc? i have win 7 32 bit. please help me with this. "
