Þ Þ Þ Instructions

   1.Donwnload this torrent

   2.Mount or Burn to CD/DVD ( Mount to VCD using Daemon or MagicDisc... Search for either on TPB if you dont have, but MagicDisc is free anyways

   3.Seed!

this is Rosetta Stone Version 3.4.5-23970

I downloaded Rosetta Stone before and after a few days of using i would always get some kind of error and end up having to reinstall everything.
I made this iso because VCDs and CD-Rs are write protected...

  Works fully never gives me the errors anymore, and this should ensure you never have to worry with those errors again


Enjoy!!!
