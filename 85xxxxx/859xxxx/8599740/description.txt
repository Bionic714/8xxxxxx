Show Description
................

From the Infowars web site :: On the Friday, June 21 broadcast of Infowars Live, Nightly News anchor David Knight fills in for Alex Jones breaking down the latest details from the unraveling NSA spy-gate scandal, which continues unabated after being brought to light of public scrutiny. 

David speaks with Dr. William Francis Pepper -- an English Barrister and American Attorney who worked with Martin Luther King's accused assassin James Earl Ray to clear his name - about how governments operate in the shadows to silence opposition. Dr. Pepper is also lead counsel for Robert F. Kennedy's accused murderer Sirhan Sirhan, who he believes was "programmed" to assassinate Kennedy. 

David is also joined by PrisonPlanet.com editor Paul Joseph Watson to discuss the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Rolling Stones journalist Michael Hastings.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
