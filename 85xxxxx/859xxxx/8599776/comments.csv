Kubrick's one-of-a-kind film is on an entirely different astral plane than Peter Hyams' rather pedestrian follow-up, based on the second in the very lengthy series of ""2001"" sequels penned by Arthur C. Clarke. Roy Scheider takes over the role of Heywood Floyd, but Keir Dullea and Hal (the voice of Douglas Rain) are back. Some of the special effects are passable but definitely not in the same league as the work in ""2001.""  There is one great moment in the film - a shot of two magazine covers showing the American president and Soviet premier - Clarke is pictured as the president and Kubrick is pictures as the Russian!"

And there's more than one great moment in the film!"
