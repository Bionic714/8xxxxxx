Today marks the beginning of the much anticipated Summer Vengeance tournament. Lyla is really bummed about losing in the featherweight tournament. She was pissed that her perfect record for season 10 is now blemished by Amber Rayne. She wants pay back and Missy Minx is just collateral damage. 

Missy Minx is ranked 16th for the tournament. 16 out of 16. She hasn't won a match yet on US but she's been training She absolutely hated losing to Audrey Rose in her first match. She especially hated getting fucked for losing. She's here today to show the world she deserves to be in this tournament. She's going to kick this tiny little feather weight, Lyla Storm, out of the tournament....or so she thinks. Brutal fucking in the bathroom. Winner has no mercy. Summer Vengeance fuckings are BRUTAL this year.
