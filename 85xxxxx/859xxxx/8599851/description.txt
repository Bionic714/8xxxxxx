Romesh was a young medical intern who dared    
to dream. He was in awe of Dr. Asthana , the   
Chief of Surgery of the Shekhawat General      
Hospital. All he wanted to was be like him.    
He lived in with Riya, his co-intern and the   
love of his life.However, when an eight year   
old boy, Ankur dies due to Dr. Asthana's       
medical negligence, Romesh realises that a     
good surgeon is not necessarily a good person. 
Together with Ankur's mother Nandita, Romesh   
sets out on a turbulent journey to fight for   
what is right. A fight for justice against     
his mentor, the hospital and the love of life.
