Geomagic Qualify delivers the highest accuracy, speed and comprehensive, automated reporting on the quality of as-built parts for first-article inspection, production inspection, and supplier management using CMM and laser scanning tools. The software delivers CAD importer tools and airfoil analysis at no charge to help manufacturers rapidly increase product and manufacturing quality identify process issues and build productivity. Advanced GD&T, probing and dimensional inspection functions enable fast and precise measurement of parts, and Geomagic Qualify includes intelligent creation of reports in 3D PDF

The Geomagic Qualify Automation Platform delivers the power to streamline almost every process, reduce human interaction in measurements and recording, decrease measuring time, and markedly enhance R&R results. Geomagic Qualify customers can dramatically cut production line down-time, increase accuracy and improve part quality during and after manufacturing

Geomagic Qualify Probe
For machine tool shops and smaller manufacturing operations looking to elevate from manual processes, Geomagic Qualify Probe offers the affordability, usability and precision required to step into accurate fast checking of first-article parts

Geomagic Qualify Probe delivers the most easy-to-use, affordable 3D inspection software that works exclusively with probing data reporting on the quality of as-built parts and automatically comparing the measurements to existing CAD data, if available, or other reference data

Geomagic Qualify Probe combines the industry-leading tools from Geomagic Qualify with probing data and devices. Fast, automated reporting in 3D PDF and Microsoft Office formats allows results to be quickly reviewed by all parties, helping broad teams understand manufacturing issues more quickly

Geomagic Studio
Geomagic Studio is the complete toolbox for transforming 3D scanned data into highly accurate surface, polygon and native CAD models

A vital component in a range of manufacturing workflows, Geomagic Studio provides the industry s most powerful point cloud editing, mesh editing and advanced surfacing functions in an intelligent, easy-to-use application. In addition to its precise 3D data processing functions
Geomagic Studio incorporates incredible automated tools, all of which enable users to produce the highest quality models in significantly less time and reduce costly man-hours. For reverse engineering, product designs, rapid prototyping, analysis and CAD export, Geomagic Studio is the core 3D creation tool

With an included command line-driven version of the software and a new Python scripting environment, Geomagic Studio is introducing unrealized levels of speed and customization to go with its robust 3D processing capabilities. Geomagic Studio also streamlines the design process by enabling seamless transfer of parametric models to a number of major CAD packages: CATIA , Autodesk Inventor , CREO Elements/Pro (Pro/ENGINEER ) and SolidWorks

Geomagic Wrap
From artists to archeologists and designers to filmmakers, people from every walk of life are creating perfect 3D models of physical objects using Geomagic Wrap

Now including exact surfacing with AutoSurface function, Geomagic Wrap delivers the most easy-to-use, affordable, fast, accurate path from point clouds to 3D polygonal models

Geomagic Wrap enables users to transform point cloud data, probe data and imported 3D formats (STL, OBJ, etc.) into 3D polygon meshes for use in manufacturing, analysis, design, entertainment, archeology and analysis
