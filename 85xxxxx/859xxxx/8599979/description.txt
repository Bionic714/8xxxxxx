The Batman Vault is a combination of history about the Batman's origins and an in-depth exploration of the lives of the Dark Knight himself. By "lives" I refer to the number of resets the Gotham Crusader has had over the years to satisfy and adjust for the new fans, not to mention sorting out the complexities of an ever complex DC Universe's multiple Earths and that in real time, Batman as a comicbook has been going since 1939. In that respect, authors Robert Greenberger and Matthew K. Manning have done a remarkable job in explaining them all and in context so that anyone or even a novice to all the variants should come away with a deeper understanding of what's been going on and no doubt recognize his or her own Batman. The book also includes an assortment of rare collectibles that can only be found in this collection. A must-have for Batman fans of all ages.
