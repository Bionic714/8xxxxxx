Seven Ages Of Britain - The First Age: 6000 BC - 1000 BC

Historian Bettany Hughes looks at the struggles between man and the environment since 6000BC, when global warming transformed Britain into an island.

The Seven Ages of Britain - The Second Age 1500BC-43AD

Historian Bettany Hughes explores the period from 1500BC to 43AD, comprising the Bronze and Iron Ages, which
saw Britain engulfed by widespread flooding and the hunter-gatherers forced to abandon their homes and learn
new skills. Tribes came into existence and people gave themselves names, picked rulers, used simple coinage,
and became traders with their continental neighbours.

The Seven Ages Of Britain - The Third Age : 43 - 410AD

Historian Bettany Hughes explores the third age of Britain, from 43 to 410AD, when the Romans arrived and
took control of the island, consolidating their burgeoning empire's position as a great world power. The programme
reveals how the country became vulnerable to invaders when the rulers ran out of money.

Seven Ages Of Britain - The Fourth Age: 410 AD - 1066 AD

Bettany Hughes considers the fourth age, between 410 and 1066AD, a period of change that led to the disintegration of Britannia following the gradual collapse of the Roman Empire and an invasion by Scandinavians and northern Europeans, hungry for power and land. Out of the upheaval and chaos came the gradual development of a wealthy, independent England, which many would recognise today in areas of language, law, religion and economy.

The Seven Ages of Britain - The Fifth Age : 1066-1350AD

Bettany Hughes considers the fifth age of Britain, from 1066 to 1350, charting the period between two
shattering historical events - the invasion of William the Conqueror and the Black Death. She looks for
evidence of the effects of the Norman conquest, from the castles that sprang up to the soaring cathedral
vaults that marked the peak of medieval exuberance.

Seven Ages Of Britain - The Sixth Age: 1350 AD - 1530 AD

Bettany Hughes considers the sixth age of Britain, from 1350 to 1530AD, a period which saw Henry VIII provide land for the country's peasantry and begin the dissolution of the monasteries. The programme reveals how the power of the old nobility was weakened as new aspirational groups emerged - capital farmers in the countryside and merchant adventurers in the cities.

The Seven Ages Of Britain - The Seventh Age : 1530 - 1700AD

Bettany Hughes provides an insight into the seventh age of Britain between 1530 and 1700, from the Elizabethan
era to the eve of the agricultural and industrial revolutions. The documentary chronicles the emergence of many
characteristics of the modern nation, such as political rights, secular entertainment, capitalism and the creation
of the middle class.
